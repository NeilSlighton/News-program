In his remarks, McConnell, R-Ky., said, “no states have yet certified their election results” and that recounts are already expected to occur in “at least one or two states.” The longtime senator argued that President Trump is “100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”

Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr on Monday gave federal prosecutors the green light to pursue ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election is certified next month, even though little evidence of fraud has been put forth.

2,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-biden-picking-rahm-emanuel-for-cabinet-would-be-divisive,AOC says Biden picking Rahm Emanuel for cabinet would be ‘divisive’,"Progressive Democrats and activists will be warily watching Joe Biden’s cabinet choices, US Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez said Monday — while publicly weighing in against former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.

“Someone like Rahm Emanuel would be a pretty divisive pick,” Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told the New York Times.

“And it would signal, I think, a hostile approach to the grass-roots and the progressive wing of the party.”

Ocasio-Cortez cited Emanuel’s record on racial justice and his opposition to teachers unions while serving as mayor of Chicago, the Times said.

“I think that’s what people are keeping an eye out for: Is this administration going to be actively hostile and try to put in appointments that are going to just squash progressives and organizing?” she said.

“I don’t envy the Biden team. It’s a very delicate balance. But I think it’s really important to strike a good one. Because it sends a very, very powerful message on the intention to govern.”

EX-CLINTON ADVISER QUESTIONS BIDEN VOTE OVER HIS STANCE ON MORE SHUTDOWNS

Emanuel is favored by some Biden advisers as a potential secretary of housing or transportation, the Times said.

In his own comments to the Times, Emanuel said Biden’s projected victory — which was driven largely by wins in Rust Belt states that President Trump captured in 2016 — proved that voters weren’t moved by far-left politics.

“The progressives said we need a base candidate,” Emanuel said.

“No we didn’t. We needed someone to get swing voters. If you campaign appropriately, you can make that a governing transformation.”

Prior to running the Windy City, Emanuel served as President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff after an earlier stint as President Bill Clinton’s political director.

Emanuel’s combative, foul-mouthed style earned him the nickname “Rahmbo” and he was quickly fired from that job and shifted to a post as a White House senior adviser.

3,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-likely-to-head-up-budget-committee-if-senate-flips,Bernie Sanders likely to head up Budget Committee if Senate flips,"Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, could end up as the head of the Senate’s Budget Committee, should the chamber fall out of Republican control.

Sanders has been the ranking member of the budget committee since 2015, which means he is the most senior member of the minority party.

Traditionally, the majority party member with the greatest seniority on a particular committee serves as its chairman.

A spokesperson for Sanders’ office did not return Fox News’ request for comment regarding his potential interest in the position.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., previously cautioned that Sanders could end up in this position during the 2016 election – a prospect that Sanders said at the time sounded like “a very good idea” to him, as reported by The Washington Post.

Democrats, however, did not reclaim the Senate.

PROGRESSIVES EYE TOP ECONOMIC POSTS IN POTENTIAL BIDEN CABINET

The budget committee’s current chair, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., is retiring, leaving the spot open.

If Republicans maintain control, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is largely expected to take up the post.

Control of the chamber is largely hinging on two runoff races in Georgia, where Republican incumbents Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue will defend their seats in January.

That may not be the only economically-inclined position of power Sanders could take up in the coming years.

As previously reported by Fox News, the Vermont senator is also said to be eyeing a key role in the Biden-Harris administration – Labor Secretary.

Sanders was a prominent force behind a push to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour – and he launched successful campaigns to pressure big companies like Amazon and Walmart to implement the policy.

Sanders’ platform was well-known for containing a slew of proposals to reduce costs for American households, ranging from ""Medicare for All"" to tuition-free college to free child care and early education, as well as the elimination of student loan debt.

President Trump has branded President-Elect Joe Biden a “puppet of left-wing extremists” who would acquiesce to demands of the progressive sect of the party.

Here's how he plans on doing it.,"One of Joe Biden's first priorities as president-elect will be implementing mask mandates nationwide by working with governors. The future 46th president, however, says if they refuse than he will go to mayors and county executives and get local masking requirements in place.

STANFORD RESEARCHER WHO TRACKED TRUMP RALLIES CONCERNED BUT CAN'T COMMIT TO STUDYING BIDEN CELEBRATIONS

Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel believes that while masks are ""the icing on the physical distancing cake"" and should be worn properly both indoors and outdoors, especially when people are too close together, a more punitive approach to mask wearing may have the opposite impact of what the administration intends.

""I think masks are quite useful, but they have a place and they're not the be all and end all,"" Siegel said. ""I'm worried that mandating this with fines and such may actually lead to more of a rebellion against it.""

He noted that the use of masks should be determined based on how much of the risk of exposure to the coronavirus is in a specific area rather than mandating it everywhere.

As for social distancing, Biden's plan says it will be used as more of a ""dial"" approach that will determine the risk of spread using evidence-based guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a move Siegel says is a mistake.

""I don't think social distancing is dial. I think masks are a dial,"" Siegel said. ""Social distancing is something we should just be doing right now. You never know how much virus was in the community.""

He believes physical distancing is actually more important to curbing the spread than masks are.

""I think physical distancing is more important than masks,"" Siegel argued. ""If you're 10 feet away from someone, you're not going to get the virus. If you're one foot away with a mask, you might.""

Siegel's comments come just a day after crowds flooded the street across major cities to celebrate Biden's projected win. While the majority of Americans supporting Biden have worn masks, many of the celebrations over the weekend had an absence of social distancing, which the president-elect has appeared silent on.

Biden on Monday is slated to announce his coronavirus task force, which will be headed by Vivek Murthy, the former U.S. surgeon general, and David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

In addition, another member of the task force expected to play a key role will be Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an adviser to Biden and the architect of the Affordable Care Act. Emanuel told MarketWatch in an interview that it could be as late as November 2021 before the United States will be able to get out of the pandemic.

“But it’ll probably be enough to begin opening colleges and universities [and] schools, again depending on how we distribute this thing and how effective we can be on that,” he added.

Biden is expected to go through his seven-point plan on Monday, which will also detail measures including but not limited to ramping up testing, securing PPE supply chains with the Defense Production Act, and investing in vaccines, according to a newly launched transition website.

The United States has surpassed 9.9 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 237,000 related deaths, according to the latest update by Johns Hopkins University."

Kate Bedingfield was asked by NBC News’ Chuck Todd about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s comments that candidates who campaign on progressive issues abandon them after winning.

“I think that Vice President Biden campaigned on an incredibly progressive and aggressive agenda. Take a look, for example, at his climate plan. It’s the boldest biggest climate plan that’s ever been put forward by, you know, by a nominee running for president and now a president-elect,” Bedingfield said on “Meet the Press.”

“He’s going to make good on those commitments,” she said.

BIDEN PREACHES UNITY, PROMISES TO ADDRESS CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IN FIRST SPEECH AS PRESIDENT-ELECT

“It’s a perfect example of the kind of big effort that he is going to make to meet this moment and to meet these crises that we’re in,” Bedingfield said.

Ocasio-Cortez, who won re-election easily last Tuesday, was asked in a New York Times interview published Saturday what she expected of the incoming Biden administration on their embrace of the party’s progressive wing.

“I don’t know how open they’ll be. And it’s not a personal thing,” she said. “It’s just, the history of the party tends to be that we get really excited about the grassroots to get elected. And then those communities are promptly abandoned right after an election.”

Meanwhile, Rep. Cedric Richmond, the co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said Sunday that the former vice president’s flipping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — states that backed Trump in 2016 — will strengthen his hand when negotiating with congressional Republicans.

“I think Vice President Biden will be a different kind of president,” Richmond (D-La.) said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “I think he’s going to be able to bring House members from the Republican side, Senate Republicans together, on legislation.”

“But then again, you have to look at his numbers. He won Arizona, he won Georgia,” Richmond added. “That will give him some coattails and some leverage when dealing with the Senate.”"

The Fox News Decision Desk projected on Saturday that Democratic presidenital nominee Joe Biden would win the state of Nevada and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, giving the former vice president the electoral votes he needed to defeat President Trump and become president-elect. But the president has yet to concede, as he hopes that a flurry of lawsuits he’s filed and a couple of recounts in key states will reverse Biden’s victory.

Biden, as of Monday afternoon, had won a record breaking 75.67 million votes nationally. And Trump, in defeat, garnered a massive 71.07 million votes.

The margins were tighter in the crucial battleground states that Biden secured to win the Electoral College count.

Biden is ahead of Trump by 275,351 votes in six key states – Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada. As of Monday evening Biden was ahead of the president by 15,432 votes in Arizona, a slim 11,595 in Georgia, 45,475 in Pennsylvania, 146,123 in Michigan, 20,540 in Wisconsin, and 36,186 in Nevada.

It was a similar story four years ago, although Trump's margin of victory over Clinton was smaller.

Trump won Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin – three states that had been carried by the Democrats in presidential elections for a quarter century – by just 78,000 votes over 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The combined 46 electoral votes in all three states were enough to put Trump over the top. And Trump carried Florida’s 29 electoral votes by a margin of just under 113,000."
7,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-trump-legal-fight-election-voter-fraud-claims,McConnell backs Trump legal fight in election results,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed the Trump campaign’s legal challenge of voting results in several battleground states on Monday in his first public comments on the floor since Election Day.

In his remarks, McConnell, R-Ky., said, “no states have yet certified their election results” and that recounts are already expected to occur in “at least one or two states.” The longtime senator argued that President Trump is “100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”

“The core principle here is not complicated: in the United States of America, all legal ballots must be counted, any illegal ballots must not be counted, the process should be transparent or observable by all sides and the courts are here to work through concerns,” McConnell said.

McConnell spoke out days after Fox News and other media outlets projected Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the president-elect of the United States. Biden and his running mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have begun work with their transition team.

The Trump campaign has mounted legal challenges and alleged voting irregularities or outright fraud in several states, but it has yet to produce significant evidence to back up the claims. McConnell called for any claims that surface to be investigated.

“If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light,” McConnell said. “If the Democrats feel confident that they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny. We have the tools and institutions we need to address any concerns.”

McConnell referenced the 2020 presidential election, when a recount took place in Florida due to the thin margin of votes that separated George W. Bush and Al Gore. He noted the Gore campaign mounted a lengthy legal challenge and that Gore did not concede the race until December of that year.

“Let’s not have any lectures, no lectures about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election,” McConnell said in Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election.

McConnell said the 2020 election appears to have been free from meaningful foreign interference.

“There is no suggestion that our foreign adversaries were allowed to undermine the integrity of our process,” McConnell said."

While leaders across Europe and the Middle East applauded Biden’s projected victory, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin have kept counsel.

As recently as the days leading up to the election, Putin was quoted by state media as he weighed in on the Hunter Biden allegations, saying, ""I don’t see anything criminal about this, at least we don’t know anything about this [being criminal].""

The leaders are possibly waiting for results to be confirmed before making any official statement, but the silence is deafening.

Iran’s government has issued a number of comments, from the ayatollah decrying the result as “ugly” regardless of the winner while political aides established strong stances ahead of potential new dealings with a President Biden.

Other nations who found themselves close allies of President Donald Trump have offered formal statements while avoiding any outright congratulations.

Turkey Vice President Fuat Oktay simply stated that a Biden victory would not change relations between the two nations, but he did warn that the president-elect should reconsider any intentions to toughen America’s stance on Turkish foreign interventions, Haaretz reported.

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made no statement, but referred to Biden as an “interventionist” over the summer, referencing comments that Biden made that he would support “opposition leadership” in Turkey.

“Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process,"" Biden was quoted as saying in an interview with the New York Times editorial board years prior, according to Reuters.

As such, Biden’s relationship with Turkey shows signs of turbulence before he has even prospectively taken office.

Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued only a formal congratulations to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, referring to a “long & warm personal friendship,” but never referring to him as president-elect.

Netanyahu also wrote a statement thanking Trump for his work over the past four years, particularly for the “historic peace accords” from this past year.

Meanwhile, China has offered support for the incumbent president of Guinea, who faces allegations of fraud during his reelection bid, the Independent reported.

“China and Guinea are good friends. … We value our tradition of friendship and stand ready to work with the Guinean side to further advance our comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to achieve benefits to our two peoples,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a regular briefing on Monday.

A transition official told Fox News that several options are on the table to move forward with Biden’s transfer to power with Trump not living up to the law.

The General Services Administration (GSA) has not yet made an ascertainment decision on Biden, withholding the green light to begin his transition. The delay is costing the Biden team access to more than $6 million in federal funding, security clearances and the ability to meet with other officials at intelligence agencies.

Trump has challenged the result of the election amid allegations of voter fraud in swing states.

The official said not recognizing Biden’s transition team also denies access to the State Department – which facilitates calls between foreign leaders – as well as funds for salaries and classified information.

Delaying ascertainment can be a major threat to our national security, the official said. Just as in the year 2000, delayed transition to the Bush administration reportedly put the country at greater risk leading up to 9/11.

According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the transfer holdup hindered Bush’s ability to appoint key officials including national security personnel.

Manchin told ""Special Report"" on Monday that he is a proud Democrat and that it must be understood that not every elected member of the party supports the progressive wing's policy priorities -- though appeared to acknowledge they have been given some weight during the election cycle.

He noted that if Republicans Sens. Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina are able to fend off Democratic challengers in two races not yet called by Fox News, the control of the chamber may come down to dueling runoff elections in Georgia.

Incumbent Kelly Loeffler -- appointed to fulfill the rest of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson's, R-Ga., term -- and David Perdue, both Republicans, face Pastor Raphael Warnock and journalist Jon Ossoff respectively in January.

""50-50 [control] means that if one senator does not vote on the Democratic side, there is no tie and there is no bill,"" Manchin said.

""I commit to tonight and I commit to all of your viewers and everyone else that's watching, I want to allay those fears, I want to rest those fears for you right now because when they talk about, whether it be packing the courts or ending the filibuster, I will not vote to do that,"" he continued.

Manchin called the U.S. Senate a ""unique"" legislative body in that the original parameters encourage bipartisanship.

He said that he also does not know whether any or enough Democrats would support bills along the lines of ""defunding the police,"" and that he believes there would in turn be Republicans willing to compromise on ""fixing"" ObamaCare.

To back up his pledge not to support ending the filibuster and such, he pointed to his opposition to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., doing so for judicial nominees several years ago.

Manchin also however dismissed any contention that he would switch parties due to his moderate stance on such issues, a question that has come up in the past as well.

""I'm a proud moderate conservative Democrat. Maybe there's not many of us left but I can tell you what this country wants is moderation,"" he said.

The president was referring to Perdue’s closely watched Senate race in Georgia against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who has been making gains on the Republican's vote count. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that it appeared the two were headed to a runoff.

Fox News had projected an even split with both Democrats and Republicans holding 48 Senate seats after the election. Along with North Carolina's Senate race, Georgia's will be critical for each side achieving control of the upper chamber of Congress.

James' campaign ended in a narrow defeat in what turned out to be one of the tightest Senate races in the country against incumbent Michigan Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.

James said in a statement, “While Senator Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat. While not everyone wins in an election, voters must be confident that the election was fair and honest. Failure to do so, is the end of democracy.”

Trump’s tweet came as some of his supporters held protests outside ballot-counting centers in key battleground states.

On Thursday, Trump held a news conference at the White House where he vowed he would not “allow corruption to steal” the election. He’s been criticized by Democrats and some in his own party over his claims of widespread voter fraud.

“This is a case where they’re trying to steal an election, trying to rig an election,” he said.

Graham told ""Hannity"" that recent changes to the rules in Pennsylvania and Michigan were troubling in that regard.

He appeared to reference a 2020 adjustment from the Pennsylvania Department of State -- which issued orders that largely eliminated the ballot signature verification requirement. Commonwealth officials also ordered that ballots arriving before Friday evening should be accepted but segregated if they are either postmarked by Election Day or lack a postmark.

Graham said that signature verification -- wherein the facsimile on a ballot is compared to the one on record with county election officials -- is a key preventative measure against potential fraud.

He said that in Michigan, paperboard was put up over the windows of a canvassing location, obstructing the public's view of what was going on.

""Today, if you have a lot to make sure that election counting is observed by both parties and you cant do it, the remedy is to take those ballots off the table that were not allowed to be observed,"" he said, in an apparent reference to complaints by partisan poll watchers at the Pennsylvania Convention Center who said they were kept too far away from the canvassing to ascertain with specificity how it was being conducted.

""If you have a signature requirement and it wasn't followed, the remedy is to make sure those ballots collected are not counted. It's pretty obvious. If the legislative body passes a law, will we allow a handful of people at the polling site to undo it? Does the law really matter if a handful of individuals on their own can take it into their own hands?"" Graham asked.

""Is it OK for people at polling sites to rewrite the law so that Republicans can't watch? Is it okay to ignore the signature requirement which is there to protect the integrity of the ballot?""

Shafer said county election officials told “the media and our observers that they were shutting down the tabulation center at State Farm Arena at 10:30 p.m. on election night only to continue counting ballots in secret until 1:00 a.m.”

He continued, “No one disputes that Fulton County elections officials falsely announced that the counting of ballots would stop at 10:30 p.m. No one disputes that Fulton County elected officials unlawfully resumed the counting of ballots after our observers left the center.”

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Monday that election officials in the state have not found any evidence of wrongdoing. The paper’s report said there have been cases of “minor issues” caused by human error.

Richard Barron, the head of the Fulton County Elections, told the Journal-Constitution that he sent home just about all his workers at about 10:30 p.m. on election night. The paper said GOP observers “thought all was done for the night.” But a handful of counters stayed until 1 a.m., along with a state observer, to tally the votes. Barron told the paper that the GOP was welcome to observe.

Shafer said media outlets are ""gaslighting you"" when they claim there was no evidence of ""irregularities in the election.""

President Trump has taken a keen interest in the Peach State and tapped Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who retweeted Shafer's post, to head a recount effort. Collins said he is confident of “improperly harvested ballots and other irregularities that will prove” Trump won the state.

Fulton County on Saturday began re-scanning some votes first counted Friday. County officials said they noticed some ballots had not been counted or scanned properly. County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt said workers are rescanning the batch of ballots in question and they would repost the results later.

The paper reported that Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who both face runoffs that could determine the fate of the Republican Party in the Senate, called on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to resign.

“The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” he said. “As Secretary of State, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts, and that illegal votes don’t count.”

The New York Times reported that Raffensperger appointed a monitor to oversee the county, which the paper said he called, “one of our longtime problem Democrat-run counties.”

Shafer and Raffensperger did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News.

The Trump 2020 Campaign and the Republican Party of Georgia filed a lawsuit in the state Wednesday, alleging that officials in a Democratic-leaning county were counting ballots for the presidential race that were received after polls closed Tuesday.

""That's the same mob and the media that spewed never-ending, nonstop psychotic rage and hatred for four years and lied to all of you about so-called Trump-Russia collusion,"" Hannity observed.

""The media mob and the Democrats harassed this president, harassed we his supporters for four straight years with lies and conspiracy theories always questioning the legitimacy of this presidency,"" he went on.

Hannity said the media have been exposed as a ""bunch of hypocrites"" with their ""empty calls for civility and unity pretending like none of that ever happened.

""They never accepted the election results in 2016 but in seconds, Joe Biden won, let's tell the world,"" he said.

The media can try as they might, but Trump supporters are ""not going to be lectured by the same media frauds and Democrats, the ones that called us chumps, irredeemable, deplorable, sexist, racist, smelly Walmart shoppers,"" Hannity asserted.

""We cling to our God, our guns, our Constitution, our religion, and bibles, while they have been fueling a blind rage every second, every hour, of every day,"" he said."

The clashes in the Caucasus have attracted international attention and concerns over mounting tension between Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has vowed to support Armenia if attacked but also maintains relations with Azerbaijan.

Nagorno-Karabakh is located within Azerbaijan, but has been under the control of local ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since 1994. The latest outbreak of fighting started on Sept. 27 and has left hundreds — if not thousands — dead. The BBC reported that Armenians lost territory over the weekend.

“We are operating on the premise that the agreements will create the necessary conditions for a long-term and fully-fledged settlement of the crisis around Nagorno-Karabakh on a fair basis and in the interests of the Armenian and Azeri peoples,” Putin said, according to Reuters.

The Reuters report said Russian began deploying 1,960 troops and Azerbaijan will be able to keep its territorial gains. Azerbaijani forces have reportedly taken control of the strategically key city of Shushi.

“This is not a victory, but there is no defeat until you consider yourself defeated,” Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said, according to the report. “We will never consider ourselves defeated and this shall become a new start of an era of our national unity and rebirth.”

Ingraham noted how Biden said wearing masks is a good way to start ""pulling the country together,"" and objected to the sentiment.

""Wait a minute. Wearing a mask is a good way to start pulling the country together? What does 'pulling the country together' have to do with science or health,"" she asked.

""Get it? The more you hear these guys talk about COVID, the more it sounds as though their perspectives are truly political -- entirely political.""

Ingraham said most Americans are accepting and often interested in cooperating on public health measures when they have an empirical effect on helping the situation at hand -- but that a line is drawn when efforts become overtly political.""

""They are not going to give up their traditional liberties and part of a political effort to start pulling the country together. They have been tearing the country apart for the last three years,"" she said.

She noted that Democratic activists and supporters spent much of the weekend in condensed crowds celebrating Biden's projected win -- ""No COVID there.""

Nodding to the prospect of a likely divided government, Ingraham disagreed with the contention that Biden and his political allies have received a mandate for political partisanship, but rather cooperation.

""For months now I have made it clear that COVID is a national tragedy that should have been something that brought us all together. Instead, Democrats used it as a political weapon. It was effectively Joe Biden's running mate. Now the election is over. A vaccine is on the way. And they are still using it,"" she said.

""What was Biden's phrase? Start pulling the country together? Sorry, Democrats. You don't have that kind of power. If you want to pull the country together, I'd suggest you start treating the rest of us as free and equal citizens. Ordering us around or trying to will only backfire."""

County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said that six morgue trailers had already been deployed as of Monday and four more were requested from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). They will be sent to local funeral homes amid demand for increased storage space.

Samaniego said coronavirus deaths in El Paso County showed no signs of slowing down, El Paso's KFOX-TV reported.

“It doesn’t look good,” he said. “It may be as much as 20 per day, the next two to three weeks. There might be more and more an incline of deaths.”

At least 64,158 people were confirmed to have tested positive and more than 673 deaths have been reported in El Paso County since the beginning of the pandemic, according to public health data on Monday. The death toll was up from 605 reported fatalities on Nov. 2 and 557 deaths on Oct 19, data showed.

More than 1,050 people were hospitalized with the illness as of Monday, health officials said, including 304 people in intensive care units.

“Here we are going into almost a second week with very little evidence that we’re doing it properly,” Samaniego added, according to the station.

To help contain the virus surge in El Paso, Samaniego issued emergency shutdown and stay-at-home orders last month. The shutdown order was set to expire on Wednesday, but he said he was considering extending it, Reuters reported.

“As a community we need to come together and decide as fellow El Pasoans, as part of this region, to make a determination for what El Paso needs at this time,” he said during a meeting of county commissioners. “I need to repeat and emphasize that a temporary order would be very effective so that we don’t have long-term impact on our economy.”

Texas currently has the most coronavirus cases out of any state in the U.S. As of late Monday, the state has recorded at least 997,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 19,221 deaths from the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

18,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/why-network-projections-for-biden-are-hitting-a-wall-of-disbelief,Why network projections for Biden are hitting a wall of disbelief,"We are living through a split-screen moment that crystallizes not just the deep divide in the country but the equally deep distrust in the media.

For much of America, Joe Biden is the president-elect, going about the business of assembling an administration, giving a speech yesterday to announce the creation of a coronavirus task force. World leaders are calling to congratulate him.

But other parts of America believe President Trump that the “lamestream media” are trying to hijack the election on behalf of their pal Joe. Many Trump supporters believe just as strongly in his allegations that the election was warped by widespread fraud.

There is no middle ground on this one. It’s not like arguing over a Trump tax cut or Supreme Court nomination or who won the first debate.

The president has every right to pursue litigation and the press has a responsibility to cover that. But it is a statement of fact that after months of warning about mail ballots, Trump and his campaign have produced no evidence of widespread tampering--certainly nothing that would reverse, for example, Biden’s 50,000-vote lead in Pennsylvania. If that changes, the story would obviously change.

BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY, TRUMP DENIED SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE, FOX NEWS PROJECTS

But it’s telling that even with ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC and the Associated Press projecting Biden the winner Saturday morning, when newly counted ballots padded his Pennsylvania lead, many people simply refuse to accept that judgment.

Never mind that the same networks made calls reflecting Republicans probably keeping control of the Senate and picking up seats in the House, which virtually no one in the press expected. Never mind that Trump and his supporters were jubilant when the same networks projected him the winner in the early-morning hours four years ago.

But after six years of overwhelmingly negative coverage of Trump, the media can hardly be shocked if they’re no longer seen as an honest broker.

We saw a troubling snapshot last week when Trump said from the White House that the election could be stolen, that there was plenty of fraud--and ABC, CBS, NBC and MSNBC cut away to assail his lies. MSNBC barely lasted a minute before Brian Williams broke in. I have no problem with challenging Trump’s claims afterward, but these networks essentially told their audience they didn’t need to hear from this guy, and pulled the plug.

What troubles me most of all is the notion, fairly widespread among Trump backers, that the networks called the race for Biden for partisan reasons. Here too, the daylong celebration led by Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid and Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC Saturday, which had everything but balloons and party hats, might have conveyed the impression of a less than objective call. So too the snide comment from CNN’s Anderson Cooper, for which he has apologized, that Trump is like “an obese turtle on his back flailing in the hot sun.” And some viewers are upset with Fox, as if it is somehow a news organization’s job to always back Trump even when its own experts have concluded he lost the race.

Network projections can of course be wrong, as they famously were when Al Gore and then George W. Bush were prematurely declared to have won Florida 20 years ago. But no news organization wants to be tarred and feathered for blowing the call in a presidential election.

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

This is not the usual left-right debate. There’s a fascinating split on the conservative side.

Most elected Republicans are either staying quiet or supporting the president, like Lindsey Graham, but some, such as Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, are not. Bush called Biden and Kamala Harris to congratulate them and says the election was fair. And some Trump advisers are anonymously telling reporters that they are suggesting the president graciously concede.

In the media world, some of Trump’s conservative allies are in his corner and promoting his claims of election fraud. But CNN contributor Rick Santorum, the former GOP senator, has called the president’s charges “dangerous.” Trump’s ally Chris Christie told ABC he shouldn’t be hurling unproven allegations. Author and podcaster Ben Shaprio says it is “deeply irresponsible” for Trump to claim he won the election. And the New York Post’s conservative editorial page says Trump should preserve his legacy by stopping “the conspiracy-addled talk of a ‘stolen’ election.”

The president will ultimately decide whether to cooperate with a transition that the rest of the world is accepting as real. And if that happens, barring new evidence, the networks will feel vindicated. But it’s a sad commentary that many people in this country view their election projections as fake news."
19,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/europe-making-progress-locking-down-in-fight-against-coronavirus,"Europe making progress, locking down in fight against coronavirus","LISBON, Portugal — Portugal and Hungary on Monday became the latest European countries to impose curfews against the resurgent tide of coronavirus infections and deaths lashing the continent and filing its emergency wards. But glimmers of hope emerged from France, Belgium and elsewhere that tough restrictions might be starting to work.

Portugal, which like other European countries has seen new cases and hospital admissions surge in recent weeks, imposed a state of emergency and ordered some 7 million people — around 70% of its population — to stay home on weeknights from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. for at least the next two weeks. They'll be even more limited over the weekends, allowed out only in the morning until 1 p.m., unless to buy essentials at supermarkets.

""People need to comply. If they don’t, we are in a bad situation,"" said Miriam Ferreira, a 44-year-old laundry worker in Lisbon.

FAUCI SAYS HE'S NOT LEAVING JOB AFTER 2020 ELECTION, EXPECTS COVID VACCINES BY END OF THE YEAR

Portugal’s government warned that the measures may be broadened and prolonged if they prove insufficient.

Hungary also imposed its strictest measures so far: an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew announced by Prime Minister Viktor Orban. All businesses must close by 7 p.m.

Other measures in Hungary mirrored those becoming depressingly familiar across Europe, including limits on eateries and sports events, family gatherings limited to 10 people and remote learning for high school and university students. The restrictions kick in Tuesday at midnight and will remain for at least 30 days.

“I know, we all know, that this will not be easy. The next weeks will be difficult. But the vaccine is within sight, we’ve got to hold out until then,” Orban said.

Last week, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced that a small amount of a Russian coronavirus vaccine would arrive in Hungary in December for final tests, with larger deliveries in January.

The French government has gradually ratcheted up from localized curfews and bar closings to what is now a full-blown nationwide lockdown, albeit with schools and essential businesses open. Health Minister Olivier Veran said early indications are that the measures may be starting to slow the latest virus surge and that it would “have flared up faster and stronger” without them.

FAUCI CALLS PFIZER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE FINDINGS 'EXTRAORDINARY,' REPORT SAYS

Still, the situation in French hospitals and nursing homes was grim, with emergency wards approaching saturation levels and some sick patients being evacuated from struggling hospitals to others that still had space. With more than 1.8 million infections since the start of the pandemic, France has Europe's highest total of recorded cases and the fourth-highest worldwide.

Other European nations also reported the fledgling beginnings of a possible turnaround.

The Welsh government's First Minister Mark Drakeford spoke of “some tentative early positive signs” from a 17-day lockdown that ended Monday in Wales.

""Those give us some hope,” he said, as Wales' seven-day average for new coronavirus cases fell from 250 per 100,000 people to just under 220.

From Monday, Wales again allowed people to meet in small groups, and businesses — including pubs, restaurants and hairdressers — to reopen. But nonessential travel remains barred to and from neighbouring England, which is in the midst of a planned 28-day lockdown.

Infections in the Czech Republic have started to decline after a two-month rise to record high levels, and the number of people hospitalized also dropped below the 8,000-mark.

In hard-hit Belgium, health authorities also were confident that a partial lockdown dealt a blow to COVID-19.

Belgian hospital admissions for the virus appear to have peaked at 879 on Nov. 3, and fell to about 400 on Sunday, virologist Yves Van Laethem said. The drop follows a return to partial lockdown measures including the closure of nonessential businesses and extending a school vacation.

In Germany, the health minister said increased infections seem to be leveling off but that it’s too early to talk of a trend.

Germany is one week into a four-week partial shutdown. New infections have continued to increase, reaching a new one-day record of 23,399 on Saturday.

But Health Minister Jens Spahn said Monday “we are seeing that the momentum is flattening, that we have less strong increases.""

He added that more progress is needed and that only later this week “at the earliest” will the restrictions' effects become visible, “if at all.”

“We don’t want less strong increases,” he said. ""We have to get the figures down.”

With the continent increasingly hunkered-down, the director general of the World Health Organization said unity between countries would be key going forward.

“We might be tired of COVID-19, but it’s not tired of us. Yes, it preys on those in weaker health, but it preys on other weaknesses, too: Inequality, division, denial and wishful thinking and willful ignorance,"" Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus said.

""We cannot negotiate with it nor close our eyes and hope it goes away. It pays no heed to political rhetoric or conspiracy theories. Our only hope is science, solutions and solidarity.”

Biden campaign press secretary TJ Ducklo appeared on Stelter's media-focused program ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday and was asked what kind of ""tone"" a President Biden will set once he's sworn into office.

""President-elect Biden believes that the media is a critical piece of our democracy; that transparency is incredibly important,"" Ducklo said. ""He also believes, though, that it's the media's job to hold him accountable. He's there to do the people's work and he welcomes that relationship. He welcomes their role, the media's role in our democracy and I think it will be, frankly, the polar opposite of what we've seen over the last four years...

CNN'S JAKE TAPPER CONDEMNED AS 'SMUG AND REPELLENT' FOR TWEET ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Stelter summarized the exchange on Monday, tweeting: ""Coming soon: A restoration of normal relations between the president and the press corps?""

The CNN host's forecast of ""restoration of normal relations"" was panned on social media.

""This will happen without doubt. The press corps will go back to being well-behaved, deferential and sleepy, tapping into the extensive practice they had doing this in the 16 years before Trump.

Sources told The New York Times that Meacham had been ""playing a larger role than was previously known"" behind the scenes, ""both writing drafts of speeches and offering edits on many of Mr. Biden’s big addresses, including one he gave at Gettysburg last month and his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.""

Biden campaign press secretary TJ Ducklo told the Times, “President-elect Joe Biden wrote the speech he delivered to the American people on Saturday night” but that ""given the significance of the speech, he consulted a number of important, and diverse, voices as part of his writing process, as he often does.”

CNN'S DEBATE ANALYSIS INCLUDED CONTRIBUTOR WHO PREPPED BIDEN FOR PREVIOUS DEBATE

Meacham, who publicly endorsed Biden back in March, has long been a go-to analyst for MSNBC. However, the Times also reported that, according to a network source, Meacham would no longer be a paid contributor going forward but that he would still be welcomed as a guest.

But as the Times noted, Meacham did appear on MSNBC following Biden's speech on Saturday without any disclosure that he was heavily involved in the crafting of the president-elect's address.

“I’m not the historian that you are, and I don’t have the Pulitzer that you do, but do you concur that is the way we are used to hearing from our presidents?” MSNBC anchor Brian Williams asked.

“Absolutely,” Meacham answered.

MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

CNN ran into a similar issue during the Democratic primaries with its contributor Jennifer Granholm.

Granholm was a heavily-featured panelist as the network hosted two nights of primary debates in August 2019. However, Politico reported that the former Michigan governor had helped prep the former vice president ahead of NBC's first round of primary debates in July.

CNN did briefly mention Granholm's ties to Biden prior to the debate. Less than an hour before it got underway, host Erin Burnett turned to Granholm to weigh in on Biden's debate prep.

""You know him. You helped prepare him. Look, it doesn't matter how old you are, how many times you’ve done this, this is a stressful night for him,"" Burnett said to Granholm.

The second mention took place earlier, nearly two hours ahead of the debate, where Burnett mentioned to the former Democratic governor in passing ""you were helping prepare"" Biden.

“First of all, I think he does have some room for error for humanity, I mean he is like way ahead in the polls, right? But you’re right that this is a fundamental moment for him and I think he gets it,” Granholm said. “I haven’t talked to the team. Of course, I work here at CNN and I didn’t want there to be any conflicts.”

CNN did not respond to Fox News' request for comment at the time."
22,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-authorizes-investigation-allegations-voting-irregularities-no-evidence,Barr authorizes investigation into 'substantial allegations' of voting irregularities despite scant evidence,"Attorney General William Barr on Monday gave federal prosecutors the green light to pursue ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election is certified next month, even though little evidence of fraud has been put forth.

In a memo obtained by Fox News, Barr advised that allegations concerning voter fraud “should be handled with great care” and that “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries.”

Barr’s actions give prosecutors the ability to circumvent longstanding DOJ policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is formally certified.

He emphasized that his authorizing federal prosecutors to pursue “substantial allegations” should not indicate that the DOJ has “concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election.”

Barr said that investigations can be conducted if there are clear and credible allegations of irregularities that could effect the outcome of a federal election in an individual state.

“Any investigation of claims of irregularities that, if true, would clearly not impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State should normally be deferred until after the election certification process is completed,” Barr wrote.

MEDIA OUTLETS FALSELY CLAIM LONDON FIREWORKS, PARIS CHURCH BELLS WERE CELEBRATING BIDEN VICTORY

A DOJ official told Fox News that no one at the White House, including President Trump or any lawmakers, has asked Barr for this authorization.

Barr’s action comes days after Fox News projected that Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the general election. Trump has not conceded the election and he is instead claiming, without evidence, that there has been a widespread, multi-state conspiracy by Democrats to skew the vote tally in Biden's favor.

Biden holds a sizable lead in multiple battleground states and there has been no indication of enough improperly counted or illegally cast votes that would shift the outcome.

Election officials from parties have stated that the election went relatively well, despite minor issues like broken voting machines and ballots that were either miscast or lost.

""In the mid-90s, I think it was '96, I was in Kinshasa in the waning days of Mobutu and Mobutu was, you know, a pretty awful dictator and when he finally fled the country and the rebels were moving in to take the capital, his son drove around in a pickup truck with a machine gun and settling scores with people he felt had not been supportive enough for Mobutu,""

Cooper said to the panel. ""Thankfully, it hasn't come to that here but I can't believe we're in a situation where a transfer of power is not- I can't believe we are in this situation here. It just seems so petty. I know it's about Georgia, I know it's about setting up grievance politics that will perhaps allow him to run in four years again and give him a TV career.""

Cooper went on to suggest that people will die if Trump continues to contest the election results because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

""We're in a pandemic and people's lives- and even if you don't think Joe Biden is going to become the president, I don't understand why you wouldn't allow transition funds, you know, to be given to at least start that process that if, in fact, the courts decide, as it seems they would, that there isn't enough evidence this thing can continue and more people won't die because of it,"" the anchor continued.

Shapiro noted that in the weeks leading up to the election, CNN and other outlets repeatedly condemned the Trump White House for holding events and rallies in defiance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) pandemic guidance.

However, the network's concerns about the possible spread of the virus were virtually non-existent Saturday and Sunday as thousands took to the streets across the country in mass gatherings, paying little regard to the coronavirus and the health risks they consistently warned of.

""I've been hearing for months that if you went out there and you protested against the lockdowns, you are a bad, terrible, no good, very bad person,"" Shapiro said. "" If you went to a Donald Trump rally, you were endangering all of your fellow humans...you were a dangerous character.""

But, ""COVID's over guys,"" he added, characterizing it as the ""wokest virus ever.""

The conservative commentator pointed to a recent segment on CBS News, during which Gayle King compared the celebrations to a ""nationwide block party"" and praised the ""unbridled exuberance"" found in street celebrations and parades across the country.

The segment is just further evidence that the media is ""utterly full of crap,"" Shapiro said, accusing mainstream outlets of treating the coronavirus as ""just a malleable tool you can yield against your political opposition.""

Trebek died on Nov. 8 after a lengthy battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The longtime “Jeopardy!” host not only kept fans updated on his health battle every step of the way, but he continued to do his job hosting the popular trivia show as well.

Speaking on the “Today Show,” the game show's executive producer Mike Richards shared some insight into how the 80-year-old television icon spent his last day on Earth.

“Even in his book, he described that he wanted his final day to be sitting on his swing next to his wife, Jean, and kind of watching the horizon and he got to do that,” Richards said in an excerpt from his interview shared on the show’s Twitter.

There was an enormous amount of tension on the set. They all knew there was a lot on them to perform and that just goes to show that he had an incredible sense of humor but also how important it was to have a great’ ‘Jeopardy!’ game. He loved that. He’d get to the end of the show and say ‘boy, wasn’t that great?’ and he’d look right at the contestants and say ‘thank you,’” Richards said. “And that just sums him up.”

He concluded: “It was just so important for him to do this show and to support everything that it means to America.”

But a bad interception with the lead and failing to do anything with the ball with under 2 minutes to play cost the team down the stretch and helped the Patriots get a final chance to march down the field.

A senior U.S. official told Fox News that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Esper and let him know he was being fired before the president’s tweet.

Fox News has learned that Esper was involved in meetings at the Pentagon Monday morning, and was behaving as defense secretary. Sources told Fox News that the president's announcement caught some of his staff off guard.

TRUMP 'NOT BACKING DOWN,' CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAYS

Recently, there have been reports that Esper could be removed from his post or could be preparing resignation letters, but some members of his staff believed that he would remain through inauguration.

Esper's firing comes five months after he said he did ""not support invoking the Insurrection Act,"" amid nationwide protests over the summer. He has not held a press conference in the Pentagon briefing room since July.

""The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire situations,"" Esper said in June. ""We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.""

Miller was sworn in as the seventh director of the National Counterterrorism Center in August, after serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism.

From 2018 to 2019, Miller served as the special assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism and transnational threats at the National Security Council responsible for strategic-level policy making and implementation.

Miller also served in the military from 1983 to 2014, beginning in the Army Reserve, and later transferred to Special Forces. Miller participated in combat operations in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 with the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne,) and many follow-on deployments to both theaters.

The treatment will be used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in adults who are high-risk, including those 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions, and children who are 12 years or older and weight at least 88 pounds.

Eli Lilly chairman and CEO David A. Ricks said in a statement that the treatment will be a ""valuable tool for doctors fighting the now-increasing burden of this global pandemic.""

""The rapid development and availability of bamlanivimab could not have been achieved without the relentless work of our Lilly team, collaboration across the industry and the urgent work being done by the government to ensure appropriate allocation to patients who need it the most,"" Ricks added.

Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, noted that the agency will ""continue to evaluate new data on the safety and efficacy of bamlanivimab as they become available.”

President Trump urged the FDA to accelerate approval of Eli Lilly's antibody treatment back in October along with Regeneron's experimental antibody cocktail. The approval will allow medical professionals to offer an alternative treatment option to Gilead's remdesivir, an experimental drug approved by the FDA last month.

CRITICS QUESTION PFIZER VACCINE TRIAL RESULTS TIMING

While the safety effectiveness of this investigational therapy continues to be evaluated, bamlanivimab was shown in clinical trials to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to a placebo.

The drugmaker's Phase 2 trial involved 452 patients. Of 309 study participants injected with Eli Lilly’s drug, five, or 1.6%, were later hospitalized or visited the emergency room, compared with nine out of 143 people who received a placebo, or 6.3%.

Bamlanivimab should be administered via a single intravenous infusion as soon as possible after a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of symptom onset. Bamlanivimab is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19. In addition, there is insufficient data on the use of bamlanivimab during pregnancy. The company recommends the treatment's use only if ""the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.""

According to the FDA, monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation with COVID-19.

Eli Lilly will begin shipping bamlanivimab immediately to national distributor AmerisourceBergen, which will distribute it as directed by the U.S. government's allocation program.

The U.S. government has purchased 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab for $375 million and has committed that Americans will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product's administration.

The company anticipates manufacturing up to 1 million, 700-milligram doses of bamlanivimab by the end of 2020, with use around the world through early next year after discussions with global regulators.

The biggest risk, according to the Fed now, is business borrowing, which has continued to soar since 2018 as companies’ borrowing accelerated this year to bridge income losses from the pandemic. The Fed warns corporate credit quality has deteriorated and while a lot from PPP loans which may be forgiven and low-interest rates help business service debt, it’s possible that declines in sales and profits could result in defaults on loans.

Another risk: Small businesses have been hit hard by COVID-19 and strains on their ability to pay loans could “worsen significantly,” says the Fed. Credit quality for small businesses has deteriorated notably since the pandemic and has not yet stabilized, with many small businesses closing or scaling back operations.

The election worker, whose name was redacted over fears of reprisals, said they “had concerns over election polling place and intimation and voter fraud,” according to a sworn affidavit obtained by Fox News. The alleged incidents purportedly took place while the worker served at a Clark County elections center during early voting from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30.

TRUMP PLANS TO REVIVE CAMPAIGN-STYLE RALLIES AS HE PURSUES LEGAL CHALLENGES TO ELECTION RESULTS

In the affidavit, the worker claims voters were allowed to vote via provisional ballots without a valid Nevada ID or driver’s license as long as they could provide proof of an upcoming appointment at the DMV.

State officials in Nevada have denied evidence of voter fraud, with Nevada’s Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford dismissing the Trump campaign's legal efforts last week to raise questions about the vote as “garbage.”

In the affidavit obtained by Fox News, the worker also claims they “personally witnessed two people handing multiple unopened mail-in ballot envelopes to two other people who then opened and filled out the ballots against"" the side of a ""Biden/Harris van.” In another case, the worker claims that a group of people “formed a human wall” to block visibility as they were “marking ballots and placing those ballots in pink and white return envelopes.”

The worker further alleged that they “regularly saw people walking in with multiple ballots.” The Trump campaign submitted the sworn statement to the Department of Justice for review, Fox News is told.

“A sworn declaration from an eyewitness is the literal definition of evidence,” a Trump campaign attorney said in a statement. “Those on the left and in other quarters that have been screaming that there’s no evidence will need new talkers and most importantly, will have to now focus on the legitimate issues that have been raised. ”

In response to the claim, Ford’s office said it has yet to receive a formal claim but would investigate the matter if one was filed.

""This morning, we received a redacted Affidavit that does not contain the individual's name, signature or contact information. As it stands, our office has not yet received a formal complaint and cannot conduct an investigation without such critical details. This office takes allegations of voter fraud extremely seriously and works with our elections officials, as well as law enforcement partners in Nevada and other states, to investigate and prosecute voter fraud when warranted by the evidence.""

The statement added: ""Anyone wishing to file a complaint regarding voter fraud may do so by using the complaint tab of our website at ag.nv.gov.""

Another video shared by Independent Media PDX showed Biden-Harris campaign messages behind windows left shattered by the demonstrators. An anarchy symbol was also spray-painted on the building.

Police said the group quickly left the location and headed back southbound toward Laurelhurst Park. Officers arrived at the scene and made targeted arrests of people who had engaged in criminal activity. The remainder of the group dispersed into the neighborhood.

Another video showed the group appearing to wear black bloc attire marching through the park while banging on drums. Bike officers moved in and directed the group to remain on the sidewalk. A police cruiser also arrived at the park and sounded its siren.

However, the Unified Command said law enforcement response prevented more serious crimes such as looting and arson.

Portland, a city with a history of clashes between far-left Antifa and far-right Proud Boys groups, experienced over five months of near-nightly violence in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis at the end of May.

Pence, on Monday, held a meeting in the ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. According to an administration official who was in the room, the vice president walked in to a standing ovation.

The official told Fox News that Pence began by thanking everyone, and then said something in line with what he tweeted. The official told Fox News that the mood among the staff was described as encouraged by the vice president’s spirit.

Pence’s comments came after Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien held a similar meeting with staff at Trump campaign headquarters Monday morning.

“He still is in this fight,” Stepien said, according to multiple people who were in the room. “There is a process.”

Stepien added: “Have patience.”

According to people in the room, Stepien thanked the Trump campaign staff for continuing to do their jobs, and gave them an update on legal challenges and recounts in key states.

The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Georgia.

The Fox News Decision Desk called the race for Biden on Saturday after results in Pennsylvania and Nevada put him above the 270 electoral vote threshold necessary to clinch victory in the Electoral College.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have attempted to calm the public, insisting that all votes will be counted no matter how long it takes.

TRUMP WOULD CONCEDE, WORK ON PEACEFUL TRANSITION IF LEGAL FIGHT FALLS SHORT, SOURCES SAY, DESPITE TWEETS

""It's time for America to unite. And to heal,"" Biden said in a statement after his win was declared.

Despite the ongoing legal battles, sources close to Trump told Fox News he plans to graciously concede and commit to a peaceful transfer of power, if the campaign's legal challenges fail to open up a path for a second term.

Don’t make this mistake,"As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, it continues to have an undeniable impact on American finances. According to data firm Black Knight, more than 2.3 million homeowners remain 90 days or more past due on their monthly mortgage payments as of October 2020. However, one silver lining of this current economic environment is record-low mortgage rates.

These lower rates may lead you to wonder if refinancing your home loan is the right move. Credible can help make this decision for you. Just plug in your information into their free tools to get a variety of loan options and see what refinance rates you prequalify for.

While browsing loan options, don't just keep your eye on refinancing rates — your loan term is just as important. Before changing the terms of your current loan, consider these pros and cons.

Drawbacks of choosing another 30-year mortgage

Put simply, you may be better off choosing a shorter loan term. To that end, we’ve laid out the benefits of choosing a 15-year loan over a 30-year loan below. Armed with this knowledge, you should be able to determine if choosing a shorter loan term might be right for you.

1. You start the clock all over again

The first thing to know about refinancing your mortgage and getting another 30 year home loan is that you effectively start the clock all over again on your mortgage payments. After all, when you refinance you are simply taking out a new loan to pay off your old one, which means that it will take you another 30 years from the date you refinance to pay off your loan in full.

While this may not be such a big deal if you just took out your home loan a few years ago, if you've been paying down your existing loan for a while, you may not want to leave that much time until you paid off your house in full. In that case, simply paying more into your existing loan might be a better option.

4 MORTGAGE REFINANCING MISTAKES THAT CAN COST YOU MONEY

2. You’ll pay more over time

The other drawback of choosing a 30-year loan for a home refinance is that, even with today's low rates, you'll likely end up paying more money and interest charges over time. Here, interest will accrue on the loan for 30 years as opposed to 15 years, which will increase the total amount of interest that you will end up paying before the loan is finally paid off.

With Credible, you can be confident you'll find a rate that fits you best. Credible can show you daily mortgage and refinance rates for both 30-year fixed-term loans and 15-year fixed-term loans. Click here to view today's mortgage rates and compare loan options instantly.

HOW A HOME REFINANCE COULD SAVE YOU MORE MONEY

Instead, consider refinancing into a 15-year mortgage

Choosing a 30-year mortgage loan term is a popular choice among home buyers, but opting for a 15-year fixed-term may actually be a better bet (if you can handle the monthly mortgage payments). Here are some benefits of a 15-year mortgage.

1. You’ll likely get a better interest rate

Besides getting a lower interest rate, there is another reason why you might save more if you go with a 15-year loan when you refi - you'll often be offered lower rates. To give you some context, the average rate on a 30-year loan is 2.80%, according to Freddie Mac. Meanwhile, the average rate on a 15-year loan is only 2.33%.

Plug your information directly into Credible's free online tool now to compare rates and loan options.

HOW OFTEN CAN YOU REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE?

2. You’ll pay it off faster

“Refinancing into a 15-year loan gives homeowners the ability to see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel of having a home that is paid off, which is a huge benefit as they head toward retirement,” says Jonathan Bednar, CFP and Owner of Paradigm Wealth Partners in Knoxville, TN.

With a 15-year loan, your amortization schedule will be condensed, which means that you have the ability to pay off your home faster. However, keep in mind that also means that you will have a higher monthly payment. You'll need to make sure that you feel comfortable paying more each month before going this route.

While all homeowners could save money by refinancing, opting for a 15-year mortgage over a 30-year mortgage could save even more money. Take advantage of today's lower rates with a mortgage refinance. Credible can show you recent trends with 15-year fixed rates and help you get prequalified rates within just minutes after filling out some simple information.

HOW A HOME REFINANCE COULD LEAD TO $50,000 IN SAVINGS

3. You’ll pay less money overall

The last benefit of refinancing into a 15-year loan is that you will pay less money in interest overall.

For example, if you own a $300,000 home and you refinance into a 30-year loan at an interest rate of 2.8%, your monthly payment would be $1,269.48 and you would pay $115,012.80 in interest over the life of the loan.

In contrast, if you were to have a 15-year loan on the same home with the same interest rate, your payment would be $1,917.74 monthly and you would only pay $54,193.49 in interest over the life of the loan.

Use an online refinancing calculator to see how much you could save on mortgage payments.

MORTGAGE RATES NEAR RECORD LOW - WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO REFINANCE

The bottom line

Lower interest rates aside, keep in mind that refinancing into a 15-year loan is not the right move for everyone. You also have closing costs to consider. According to Bednar, it can take 2-3 years to pay off your closing costs, so if you’re not planning on staying in your home for that long, it will be important to speak with a lender before you refinance.

THE BEST (AND WORST) REASONS TO REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE"
41,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/covid-cnn-network-viral-dan-gainor,Dan Gainor: COVID and CNN -- 4 times network got upset about events going viral and the one time it didn’t,"Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential race Saturday and just like that, CNN seemed to almost move on from the COVID crisis. That’s entirely expected. The Biden PR operation formerly known as a news network has been flexible in its warnings about how contagious the virus is and what to do about it.

It’s a pretty simple calculation actually, CNN gets more upset about COVID-19 when it involves people on the right. Yes, they will note the Biden crowds aren’t socially distancing and show some concern for masks. But CNN saves its viral anger for Trump.

On Saturday, CNN staffers complained that they were being unfairly characterized as downplaying the virus at Biden events. They did discuss masks and social distancing on CNN several times.

As reported by Fox News, “CNN left-wing anchor Jake Tapper appeared reluctant to come off as a nuisance to Biden supporters who were celebrating in the streets on Saturday.

#FACTSFIRST: JAKE TAPPER, CNN’S CORONAVIRUS DOUBLE STANDARD ON TRUMP AND BIDEN RALLIES EXPOSED

‘We’re also seeing people wearing masks… mostly wearing masks, they’re not socially distancing. I hate to be a scold here but we just had the highest day of infections in the United States,” Tapper told viewers. “It’s good to see people wearing masks, for some of them, they’re slipping off their face, people also need to socially distance themselves, the masks are significant, though, they are the thing that doctors say are most important.’”

And Anderson Cooper noted, “Clearly, there is not a lot of social distancing going on which is unfortunate given the raging pandemic that we have.”

On Sunday, in an interview with Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders, as Fox News reported, “Tapper asked Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders about the situation while reiterating that the partyers mostly wore masks.”

However, CNN still reserved its harshest comments for the president. Anchor Jake Tapper was complaining again Saturday that Trump “held superspreader events across the country.” He followed that rant by chuckling as he watched his native Philadelphians “in the street” celebrating. “They’re very happy,” he said, quickly moving on from COVID concerns.

PRO-TRUMP ACTRESS KIRSTIE ALLEY SLAMS CNN'S COVID COVERAGE: ‘FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA’

It’s a fact that CNN freaked out a lot more when conservatives gathered. When Trump held rallies, CNN called them a “potential superspreader sprint to win reelection.”

Here are four notable examples of CNN upset with conservatives about the virus. Followed by the one time they actually downplayed the virus (because it was CNN’s own event!)

1. Trump goes for a car ride

CNN finally found a reason to care about law enforcement. When the president went to Walter Reed Medical Center for COVID-19 treatment, the network went ape.

First they freaked out about it, even implying there was a “death watch” going on for him. But when Trump stomped on that theory, CNN wigged out even more.

The leader of the free world decided to take a drive around the block to appease his gathered fans and calm allies and markets with proof that he was doing OK. CNN couldn’t stand it. Host Ana Cabrera criticized Trump for “putting those Secret Service drivers and members who are protecting him in this moment at risk.” Even though they were wearing protective gear and it’s their job to be put at risk around the president. Some even get shot doing so.

Senior political analyst David Gergen declared Trump “wants to be at the center of attention.”

2. Black Lives Matter protests are no risk, but Trump rallies are dangerous

CNN medical analyst Leana Wen claimed that Black Lives Matter protests are safer than Trump events.

Wen, the unbiased former Planned Parenthood president, said the difference is the attitude they have attending the events. Trump supporters dare to attend “in defiance."" And that makes all the difference!

She claimed that, “At protests many people are aware of the risks and doing everything they can to reduce that risk versus at many of the rallies we are seeing people going in defiance.”

Apparently, she’s watching different events than the rest of America.

3. The great unmasking event

President Trump survived the coronavirus and went back to work. On his return, he stepped out onto the White House balcony and took off his mask to greet hundreds of his supporters.

Even though he was far from the crowd, that was too much for Trump-hating CNN. “Trump's reckless return met with a dramatically changed White House,” it wrote.

Another “analysis” argued, “it was clear that his illness has taught him very little and he will continue to endanger Americans until Election Day.”

CNN even bashed the speech itself as “dark and divisive.”

It turns out that the hysterics were misplaced. According to CNN itself, “Trump's physician Dr. Sean Conley announced in a memo that Trump no longer poses a coronavirus transmission risk.”

4. CNN hypes anti-Trump billboard to make its point

The left loves to create phony news with micro-protests and the news media lap it up. In this case, CNN anchor Erin Burnett used an Iowa billboard to attack the president.

CNN headlined the story: “Trump rally billboard says 'superspreader event this way.' (Literally.)” Of course, the billboard was actually the work of Rural America 2020, one of many anti-Trump groups.

But Burnett used it to fuel a rant blasting Trump for holding an event in Iowa. She stared at the video and said, “I see a mask. I see one mask. You get the point,” even though several were visible.

Yes, we got the point. CNN took any chance to mock Trump supporters or Trump over masks. Hmmm.

THE CNN EXCEPTION ON COVID

Yes, CNN’s own global town hall earlier this year argued against … masks

In April, CNN blasted Trump’s early actions on the virus. The network whined that the president did little in February, calling it “The lost month.” It even produced a timeline.

On March 5, the very same CNN held a public town hall called “CNN Global Town Hall Facts and Fears” about the virus. It packed in at least 64 people shoulder-to-shoulder in three rows to watch Anchor Anderson Cooper and CNN Chief Correspondent Sanjay Gupta tell the world that wearing masks was dangerous.

Yep, here’s the actual Gupta quote: “For someone who's healthy, it's not going to protect you against the virus,"" he said. “It may actually become a reservoir when you're taking it on, when you're taking it off. You could actually contaminate yourself. It traps viral particles. It doesn't do what people think it would do.""

And, being fair to CNN, maybe they didn’t know enough to not hold a public town hall on a deadly virus. Except CNN’s own coronavirus page on that date noted that: “Rome marathon canceled over coronavirus fears” and “Almost 300 million students across the world are out of school due to coronavirus.”

Yet CNN went ahead and held a public town hall.

42,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-call-unity-serious-michael-goodwin,Michael Goodwin: Biden's call for unity — here's what he can do to show he means it,"The election’s not even over yet and already Joe Biden’s peace train could be headed off the rails.

The Democrat promised repeatedly during the campaign to unite the country by governing as “an American president,” a pledge he repeated Saturday. Since the polls closed, he’s also been urging patience as the counting went on in a handful of battleground states.

“We knew because of the unprecedented mail-in vote and the early vote that it was going to take a while,” he said Wednesday. “We have to be patient, and it’s not over until every vote is counted.”

NEWT GINGRICH: WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF TRUMP OR BIDEN WON ELECTION — DESPITE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD

On Thursday he said, “Democracy sometimes is messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well, so I ask everyone to stay calm.”

Excellent advice then — and he should follow it himself now by slowing down the rush to spike the football.

Equally important, he must make sure his supporters get the message that revenge was not on the ballot because some, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, apparently believe it was.

Now that the former vice president is considered the president-elect, it is imperative that his unity message not be discarded like a faded campaign poster. It must be embedded in every decision he makes if he actually wants it to be a governing principle.

If Biden isn’t sincere about bridging the polarization, both sides will know it and the national hatreds and violence he vowed to temper will multiply. Indeed, he will have to prove repeatedly he meant what he said with his own conduct before others in public life actually believe him and begin to act accordingly themselves.

President Trump also has an important role to play. While he is entitled as a candidate and obligated as a sitting president to pursue challenges where he believes tallies are incorrect or illegal, it’s not in America’s interest or his to continue to lodge blanket accusations of fraud and theft. As young journalists are taught about good reporting, show, don’t tell. The president should let the evidence and his lawyers do most of the talking.

None of this is to suggest that Biden should not celebrate his enormous personal achievement. I was shocked he got the party’s nomination, let alone could win a record-shattering 74 million popular votes and what could be 300 electoral votes.

His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, has also made history of her own as the first female vice-president elect.

Still, both would be wise to acknowledge the more than 70 million people who voted for Trump, which would have gained him a landslide in any other year. To dismiss all those voters as racists and idiots, as many on the left do, is to consign the nation to unresolvable conflict.

Similarly, Biden and Harris should not scoff at the lawsuits and challenges in the most contested states.

If Biden were to shut his eyes and pretend that all Americans fully accept the outcome as untainted, he would be making a colossal mistake.

Giving legitimacy to those disputes would be unusual, but we live in unusual and dangerous times. If Biden were to shut his eyes and pretend that all Americans fully accept the outcome as untainted, he would be making a colossal mistake that could haunt him should he be formally declared the winner.

If he trusts the results are honest and accurate, he must do what he urged others to do — be patient and calm “until every vote is counted.”

A prime example is Pennsylvania, the first state that put him over the magic number of 270 electoral votes. Among the hot-button issues there is whether late-arriving ballots are legal, an issue flagged Friday when Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito took the highly unusual step of ordering the state to segregate those ballots and, if they are counted, to count them separately.

It’s not clear how many exist and whether they factor into Biden’s reported victory in the state. Until those issues are settled to the court’s satisfaction, the Pennsylvania results are effectively tentative.

Similarly, recounts are likely in Wisconsin and Georgia, and reports of computer “glitches” in Michigan, Nevada and elsewhere must be resolved if the results are to be widely believed.

All these resolutions can happen quickly — if Democrat state officials stop hiding behind cardboard coverings taped to windows and evicting GOP observers. Actions like that suggest there is something to hide and Biden must make it clear to those state officials that he wants full transparency and doesn’t fear it.

Another of his welcome campaign messages is one that he repeated Friday: “We may be opponents, but we are not enemies. We are Americans.”

It’s absolutely the right tone, but some of his key supporters sound more interested in humiliation and revenge than reconciliation.

His spokesman, Andrew Bates, also said Friday in a statement about Trump that “the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

No doubt that played well with the deep-state haters and resistance crowd, but it smacked of juvenile bravado and Bates deserves a visit to the woodshed. By letting the public know he doesn’t approve of such talk, Biden would be affirming his unity pledge to all Americans.

As for Ocasio-Cortez, she is supporting the reprehensible idea of having her side keep lists of Trump supporters, writing on Twitter: “Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future?”

A group of Never Trumpers echoed the banana-republic notion, saying they aimed to punish the president’s supporters. Jennifer Rubin, the odious Washington Post columnist, wrote that Trump supporters “should never serve in office, join a corporate board, find a faculty position or be accepted into ‘polite’ society. We have a list.”

The best response Biden could give is to say that he, too, is keeping a list — of those who continue to stir hatred and division and that he denounces them, regardless of how they voted.

2020 has been a wild year, and the great outdoors are no exception. A Minnesota deer hunter got more than he bargained for when he crossed paths with an alligator and got the OK from officials to shoot. Now, the outdoorsman plans to mount the gator with the buck he harvested during the unforgettable outing.

Cory Klocek was out hunting in East Bethel on Saturday, the opening day of firearms deer season for the state, Fox 9 reports. Klocek was tracking a deer around a pond when he spotted a 3-foot gator, about 10 feet away. He contacted the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and a game warden gave permission to shoot.

UTAH VOTES TO MAKE HUNTING AND FISHING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT: 'PART OF WHO WE ARE'

Reacting to the reptile, the hunter said he first thought it was “a prank.”

""That’s not something you see and then I thought ‘Maybe it’s rubber, it’s fake’ and then he moved,” the Zimmerman man told Fox 9. “I said ‘Nope that’s a real live alligator in Minnesota in November.’”

On Facebook, Klocek speculated that perhaps the animal had been kept as a pet and released into the wild when it got too large.

“No clue how it got there, or why… either way, only in 2020 can you go out to sit for deer gun season opener in Minnesota and shoot an alligator,” he wrote in a now-viral post that’s been shared over 49,000 times. “I'm still at a loss of words lol.”

Some criticized the hunter for shooting the gator, while others marveled at the turn of events.

“That is the craziest hunting tale I have ever heard,” one commenter declared.

“Stranger things happen. You just never know,” another mused.

Defending his decision, the hunter told WCCO-TV that alligators are realistically “an invasive species in Minnesota.”

A spokesperson for the DNR told Fox News that while much remains unknown, the alligator would not likely have survived the winter in the North Star State.

“We don’t know the background of this particular animal, but the DNR from time to time receives reports of reptiles such as alligators and caimans in Minnesota,” an official said on Monday. “These often turn out to be pets that were turned loose or escaped from their owners.""

""We urge people not to do this, for several reasons: these animals are not native to Minnesota and would be unable to survive the winter, which is right around the corner. In addition, we don’t want these invasive animals to disrupt our native ecosystem,"" they explained. “Rather, people who have pets that are too big should consider surrendering them, if possible.""

The American Heart Association released a statement teasing its findings on Monday, which are set to be presented later this week at a virtual conference titled “Scientific Sessions 2020.”

HAVING A BABY LATER IN LIFE MAY INCREASE LONGEVITY, STUDY SUGGESTS

Preliminary research has suggested that regular chili pepper consumers could have longer lifespans due to the fruit’s anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and blood-glucose regulating properties. These factors play a role in reducing a person’s risk of dying from a cardiovascular disease or cancer, according to the AHA.

DIABETICS SEE LOWER DEATH RISK IF THEY DRINK THESE BEVERAGES DAILY, STUDY SUGGESTS

Researchers who have come to this determination analyzed 4,728 studies related to chili peppers and the aforementioned illnesses.

More than 570,000 health records were included in these studies, which included people from the U.S., Italy, China and Iran. The candidates who ate chili peppers regularly had “a 26% relative reduction in cardiovascular mortality; a 23% relative reduction in cancer mortality; and a 25% relative reduction in all-cause mortality.”

“We were surprised to find that in these previously published studies, regular consumption of chili pepper was associated with an overall risk-reduction of all cause, CVD and cancer mortality,” said the report’s senior author Dr. Bo Xu. “It highlights that dietary factors may play an important role in overall health.”

Although there is data showing that chili pepper eaters appear to have lower risks of dying from a cardiovascular disease or cancer, it cannot be determined with certainty that the spicy plants are solely responsible or contribute to prolonged life.

He added: “More research, especially evidence from randomized controlled studies, is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.”

Of those who ate chili peppers, consumption rates were variable, so it is not clear how much would need to be consumed to offer health benefits.

The 46-year-old star was once known for being a close friend to Kim Kardashian, but in recent years, things have changed.

Rumors of trouble between the two began when eagle-eyed fans noticed that Pippen and the Kardashian sisters had unfollowed one another on Instagram.

Now, Pippen has addressed the drama during a recent appearance on the ""Hollywood Raw"" podcast.

LARSA PIPPEN FILED FOR DIVORCE FROM SCOTTIE PIPPEN: REPORT

The ex-wife of Scottie Pippen said that while she cannot recall a specific incident that led to the downfall of her friendship with Kim, they ""clearly have a different type of relationship"" these days.

""I just feel like Kanye [West, Kim's husband] was in a place where he, you know, he really didn't trust anyone with Kim,"" said Pippen, per E! News. ""So, I feel like I was the person that was like, 'Oh, like, don't be so close to her because you're so close to her' that, you know, that kind of had something to do with it.""

Larsa said she's reached out to her former pal ""a little bit,"" but is willing to put some space between herself and the reality star if it saves her and Kanye West, her husband, ""trouble.""

""If your husband feels, like, threatened by my relationship with you, then I don't want to be that person,"" explained the star. ""I've got my own s--t. I don't want to be, like, that person. Let him feel really comfortable, really secure if I'm not in the picture and just see what happens.""

In fact, Pippen felt rather supportive of Kim's decision to unfollow her.

""I just kind of felt, like, do what's best for your family, you know? Like, I love you. You and I are best friends. We've been through everything together. I would never do anything to, like, you know, jeopardize our relationship,"" she recalled. ""We're like sisters. We're family. But if you have to unfollow me to make your home a better place, then do it, you know?""

During the podcast, she also said that she was West's ""go-to person to call when he wasn't happy with X, Y and Z,"" which eventually led to her blocking the ""Power"" rapper because she ""just couldn't bear taking his calls anymore.""

After that, she felt as though Kanye had ""brainwashed"" the Kardashian family into disliking her.

A source told the outlet that there is no negativity between Kim and Pippen.

""Kim is focused on matters at home—getting Kanye healthy, her four young kids, law school and juggling her three businesses,"" said the insider. ""Larsa is newly single with her kids who are all now older and busy with her new fitness line. They are just in a different place in their lives and are not as close as they used to be but have no ill fillings at all and still stay in touch.""

Back in July, a source also told E! that Kim unfollowed Larsa as she was unfollowing many other accounts in a sort of social media purge.

""For Kim's own mental health she wanted to narrow down what was showing up on her feed,"" they said. ""There are a lot of people she is still friends with who she doesn't follow on social media.""

During Sunday's podcast, Pippen also cleared the air when it came to some of the men that are part of the crew.

For example, she insisted that the ""never"" hit on Travis Scott, the father of Kylie Jenner's baby, and Pippen said that she had romantic ties to Tristan Thompson before he got together with Khloe Kardashian.

""I was seeing him. I had him come to L.A. I brought him to a party Kim had. I introduced him to all of them,"" remembered the star. ""And then a week later, maybe 10 days later, he started seeing Khloe, which is fine. I don't even care... I'm the type of person I don't chase what's not for me.""

Fans, however, weren't too happy with Perry's actions.

""I'm not going to do that because those people voted against my basic human rights, but thanks so much for the tip, Katy!"" replied a Twitter user.

""Truth is, rich white ppl such as yourself were NEVER at risk no matter who won this election,"" said another. ""To you, this is more a disagreement of opinions –to the rest of us, this election was a matter of life or death in many aspects. So no, I won't be calling my family to console them.""

A third wrote: ""They saw 500+ kids in cages and said Ok! They heard a call for white supremacists to stand by and thought yep! They heard how he talks about women and were all in. They’re ok with a Muslim ban, a transgender military ban and more. So, no, I cannot and will not love that.""

""Not extending an olive branch to people who voted against BASIC human decency,"" wrote yet another. ""Unlike you, I don't have the privilege.""

Some came to the star's defense, however.

""I think she didn't phrase this well, i think she meant that even if your family doesn't have the same ideology or values about something you have to still love them because they are family after all,"" explained one.

""The tremendous amount of badmouthing and hating on social media, each time someone expresses a view that differs to yours, is incredible,"" said another. ""Katy can say her thoughts, and absolutely none of anyone's business to say otherwise. You don't tell someone else what comes out their mouth.""

Perry previously expressed support for the Biden-Harris ticket over the summer, when Sen. Kamala Harris was named as Biden's running mate.

""I’ve had the privilege of getting to know @kamalaharris over the years and @joebiden choosing her as his running mate is already a testament to his decision making: Kamala is exactly the kind of leader WITH experience we desperately need right now,"" wrote the singer alongside several pictures of herself with Harris.

The Historic Vehicle Association has added a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T SE with a unique past to its registry of significant vehicles. The black coupe was purchased in 1969 by Godfrey Qualls, who was a Detroit Police motorcycle patrol officer and U.S. Army vet who received the Purple Heart.

Qualls ordered it with a pistol grip shifter for its four-speed manual transmission and a 426 HEMI 4-barrel V8 with the intention of racing it … on the street.

According to the HVA, Qualls would show up and dominate an illegal race, then disappear for months at a time, turning the car into something of an urban legend known as the “Black Ghost.” But by the end of the 1970s, Qualls put it away in his garage and left it there for decades as he helped his son Gregory Qualls work on his own cars.

STOLEN PINK 'SEXY LEXY' SPORTS CAR RETURNED TO OWNER AFTER 28 YEARS

Gregory Qualls told the Detroit Free Press he remembers well going for thrill rides in the car as a boy but didn’t know about his father’s illicit escapades until after he inherited it upon his father's death in 2015 and the stories started coming to light.

“I’d know Dad was taking the car out because starting it shook the house,” he said.

Gregory Qualls brought the car back to running condition but has left it unrestored with just over 45,000 miles on it and mostly just drives it to car shows these days.

The Challenger joins a growing list of vehicles that stands at 28 and includes the recently unearthed Ford Mustang from the Steve McQueen film “Bullitt” and Ronald Reagan’s 1962 Willys CJ-6.

Professional mountain athlete Emily Harrington scaled the entire 3,000-foot granite wall of Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan last week, becoming the first woman to ever complete a free climb up the façade’s Golden Gate route in under 24 hours.

Harrington, 34, managed to finish the difficult climbing route in 21 hours, 13 minutes on Wednesday, to join the ranks of the only three other free climbers to ever complete the Golden Gate. Free climbers use only a rope to protect against falls during the assent.

“The idea is to not stop until you get to the top,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle of the challenging trek. “That’s the essence of big-wall free climbing.”

Harrington had reportedly been training for five years with the Golden Gate route in mind.

She had attempted a trial run back in November of last year, but fell 40 feet and had to be carried away in a stretcher due to her injuries, the Chronicle reported.

However, undeterred, Harrington continued to train and when coronavirus limited her traveling, she instead focused on dedicating hours of practice in the gym to prep for the climb.

“She is considerably stronger physically and emotionally than a year ago,” Adrian Ballinger, an athlete and Harrington’s boyfriend, told the Chronicle.

On Wednesday, Harrington, Ballinger and fellow professional climber Alex Honnold, the star of the Oscar-winning “Free Solo” documentary chronicling his attempt a free climbing up El Capitan in June 2017, began the journey up.

The group began at 1:34 a.m., using headlamps to light the route up, Harrington shared on her Instagram.

Harrington quickly scaled the first 2,600 feet before running into problems around noon when she fell. After a brief rest, she tried again and slipped a second time and hit her head on the wall, prompting the crew to take a long break, the Chronicle shared.

“Blood just started pouring down her face, dripping onto me at the belay,” Ballinger told the outlet.

Harrington refused to give up. Knowing she was up against the clock, she set out again after the heat let up.

A little over 21 hours later, at around 10:45 p.m., Harrington pulled herself up over the top of El Capitan.

“I never believed I could actually free climb El Cap in a day when I first set the goal for myself. It didn’t seem like a realistic objective for me. I didn’t have the skills, fitness, or risk profile to move so quickly over such a large piece of stone. But I chose it exactly for that reason,” she wrote on Instagram.

“Impossible dreams challenge us to rise above who we are now to see if we can become better versions of ourselves.”

The Hendrick Motorsports driver led championship contenders Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano and Denny Hamlin across the line at the Season Finale 500.

Elliott only needed to finish ahead of the other Championship 4 drivers to claim the title. His teammate, seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson, finished fifth in his last race as a full-time Cup Series driver.

Keeping tabs on yourself through search engines is your first line of defense. If you know the right ways to search and what to look for, you can find sensitive personal info you would have never known was public. Here’s how to perform an exhaustive search.

All this sleuthing may spur you to consider an alternative to data-hungry Google. What about a search site that won’t track you or a private email server? Nice.

Once you dig up info on yourself, it’s time to see what you can make vanish. Before you turn to paying online reputation services, take these steps yourself.

Public records: Can they be removed?

You can request to remove sensitive information like your phone number or Social Security number from public records in most states. Don't expect to have court records, marriage licenses or mugshots wiped from the internet, though.

52,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/5-ways-youre-wasting-money-on-tech-purchases,5 ways you’re wasting money on tech purchases,"What a year it has been for our collective wallets. Now that the holiday shopping season is underway, I bet you're thinking about ways you can save money.

First, remember you don’t have to spend a fortune on a great gift. Here's my guide to presents people will love under $100. If you can budget a little more, check out my best tech picks under $150.

To pass the time during the pandemic, you likely signed up for streaming subscriptions. Make sure you're not spending hand over fist every month on ""cheap"" subscriptions that add up to a whole lot of money. Tap or click for insider secrets to pare down your streaming budget and still watch what you want.

Now, let’s jump into common ways you’re wasting money on consumer tech and smart ways to save next time you hit “buy.”

1. Buying everything when it’s released

Back in 2010, Apple’s annual product announcement event slogan was, “This changes everything. Again.” The change Apple really wants is in your pocket. Every year, we have new iPhones, iPads, i-this, and i-that. Frankly, the last three years’ iPhone changes weren’t worth annual upgrades.

Here’s the thing to remember. If whatever tech you are thinking about upgrading works fine, and you’re happy with it, there’s no need to buy something new. Don’t get caught up in the vicious cycle of continually upgrading.

Whether it’s a TV, laptop, phone, drone, desktop, wearable, or fill-in-the-tech-blank, there will always be something newer, better, smaller, larger, more powerful, and faster for you to buy. Give your credit card a break. It’s costly to upgrade all the time, plus it takes time and effort to switch from the old to the new.

Wondering what tech is really, truly worth the money? From smart speakers to streaming devices, we nailed down the essentials.

2. Buying used tech from who knows who

When cash is tight and you need a car, it’s wise to consider a used car with a good warranty. The same goes for previously owned consumer tech. Like a used car, though, you need to shop carefully to make sure you’re not getting a lemon that doesn’t work correctly.

Used tech goes by several names, including refurbished, renewed, off-lease, and remanufactured. Typically, the manufacturer or the site will offer a return policy or a special warranty. You need these assurances with any used tech.

Second-hand devices sold by individuals on sites like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace may be cheaper for a good reason. You’re relying on the seller’s opinion of the device’s condition.

Unless you set up certain conditions beforehand when buying, such as using an escrow service, you’re not going to get any guarantee that the device works as advertised. You might end up with a PC as a huge paperweight.

3. Not checking Amazon Renewed

Amazon Renewed sells rebuilt and refurbished pre-owned items, including laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, cameras, computers, monitors, power tools, and more. Amazon says that all Renewed merchandise is ""tested and certified to work and look like new.""

There is a caveat: The products have no visible cosmetic imperfections to the naked eye when held 12 inches away.

Amazon Renewed is worth checking out. Products come with at least a 90-day guarantee. The guarantee may be longer depending on the product, maybe up to six months. If your device malfunctions or doesn’t work as expected, you can return it or get a replacement.

But, and here’s the big but, the product’s description must state that it’s “Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.”

Here are a few laptop deals that I found:

Looking for a Macbook? This Renewed Apple MacBook Air has an 11.6-inch screen, Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM, and 128GB SSD. It's two years old, which is fine and is half the price of a new Macbook Air at under $500.

Want Windows laptop? This Renewed Windows 10 Pro Dell Latitude has a 14.6-inch screen, Intel Core i5-6300U, 8GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD priced around $450.

If cash is tight, I found a Renewed Samsung Chromebook with an 11.6-inch screen, Exynos 5250, 2GB RAM, and 16GB SSD for less than $200.

It’s worth noting that eBay has a new Certified Refurbished marketplace. Here, you’ll find brands like Microsoft, Acer, Lenovo, Hoover, and Philips selling goods backed by a 2-year Allstate Warranty. If you do buy, know there is only a 30-day return window.

Best Buy and Apple also sell refurbished items on their site.

4. Get a Peloton without the cost

I love my Peloton bike, and the variety of classes and instructors' personalities have been my sanity saver throughout this pandemic. But it’s over $2,500 by the time you get the bike, shoes, mat, heart monitor, and delivery fees. Add to that the $40 per month fee to take the classes.

To get almost the same experience, load the Peloton app on your phone or tablet to use with your own stationary bike. You get all their live and on-demand cycling classes including those off the bike, such as yoga, strength building, and running. After your 30-day free trial, the Peloton app costs $12.99 per month.

If you’re in the market for a new stationary bike, the Sunny Health and Fitness Indoor Cycling Bike looks and works a lot like the Peloton bike. You use the flywheel to set resistance and it has a large holder on the handlebars for your device running the Peloton app.

You might want to add a fitness mat, clip-in pedals and shoes. That’s up to you.

Be sure to attach the Wahoo Cycling Cadence Sensor to your stationary bike’s crank arm or your shoe to complete the Peloton experience. Then, just clip-in and get going!

5. Not saving a buck where you can

Some people call me ""cheap."" I'd instead use the word ""frugal."" I've always believed that a dollar saved in my pocket is better than a dollar put in someone else's.

This advice reaches far beyond consumer tech. You can save money so easily using promotional code gathering browser extensions. One of my favorites is Honey. Once installed, it will search the web for valid promo codes and apply them right to your cart.

Wikibuy from Capital One works differently. It shows side-by-side price comparisons from multiple retailers. Talk about a time-saver.

With the shopping season in full force, if there is a particular maker or site you know that you're using, set up a Google Alert. This way, whenever a specific phrase is used on the web, you are automatically notified.

Visit Google.com/alerts and type the notification phrase. Use the brand name or the brand name + discount/coupon/special offer as the alert. Click on Show options to change settings for frequency, sources, language and region. You can also choose how many results you want and where you want them sent. Click Create Alert to start receiving alerts on your topics of interest.

Finally, sign up for any of your favorite brands or site's email newsletters. Discounts and special offers are typically sent out this way.

Shares of Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc., the two top U.S. manufacturers, fell more than 9%, while Vista Outdoor Inc. - one of the nation’s largest ammunition makers -- fell over 12%, Reuters reported.

The drop comes as Pfizer said that early results from its coronavirus vaccine suggest the shots may be a surprisingly robust 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, putting the company on track to apply later this month for emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

US GUN SALES SOAR AMID PANDEMIC, SOCIAL UNREST, ELECTION FEARS

“If a vaccine that is 90% effective can truly bring COVID to an end, the return to work and school could subsequently bring sales in these categories back down to normalized levels,” said Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio.

Firearms sales surged in recent months amid worries that Joe Biden and the Democratic party would win the presidency and take control of the senate, according to the news organization. Violent protests this year, and fears of civil unrest amid the 2020 presidential election also contributed to the gun buying, reports said.

In August, Mark Oliva, a spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said gun sales have “outpaced last year’s” numbers – and set monthly records – for each month since March.

Sales of sporting goods have also increased this year as the coronavirus pandemic prompted an increase in spending by consumers.

THIS YEAR'S GUN SALES HAVE ALREADY OUTPACED 2019'S TOTAL, RESEARCH SHOWS

“The confluence of COVID-19 restrictions, civil unrest, calls to defund law enforcement and political figures and courts that are unwilling to hold criminals accountable for their actions are undeniable factors causing Americans to assess their own personal safety and choose to exercise their right of personal protection,"" Oliva said, at the time.

Shares of Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc. had soared 131% and 59%, respectively, in 2020, Reuters reported last month.

Despite their stocks dropping recently, Dionisio predicted that fears of gun control could still fuel another surge in firearms purchases.

In order to prevent the panic buying and stockpiling of goods that occurred at the onset of the pandemic in March, many stores are taking preventive steps.

AMAZON TO MONITOR PRICE-GOUGING AMID SECOND WAVE OF PANIC BUYING

Starting Monday, Kroger will enforce limits on key items like bath tissue, paper towels, disinfecting wipes and hand soap.

“To ensure all customers have access to what they need, we’ve proactively and temporarily set purchase limits to two per customer on certain products,” a Kroger spokesperson said in a statement to FOX Business.

The limits will apply in-store, as well as to e-commerce orders.

Kroger is not the first to signal the prospect of hoarding during the fall and winter, especially as more consumers rush to replenish their original essentials stockpiled during global lockdowns and stay-at-home orders.

Last week, Publix implemented customer purchase limits on paper towels and bath tissue due to much higher customer demand. Like many other retailers, the chain is on allocation from other supplies and stained by its supply chains. Restrictions on quantity are based on individual stores, however.

Many other grocery chains are enacting new measures to keep its supplies afloat, as well.

AMERICAN SHOPPERS PANIC-BUYING AS CORONAVIRUS SPIKE AGGRAVATES YEAR OF UPHEAVAL

Harris Teeter is putting limit signs on certain items in its cleaning section.

“We’ll continue to monitor the situation, and if we see a need, we may re-introduce limits to other items,” a Harris Teeter spokesperson told Fox Business.

Around 16% of household cleaning products have remained out of stock across all retail industries in November, a report from market research firm IRI shows. At the same time, 20% of paper products were out of stock during the week ending on November 8, dipping 2 percentage points from the average supply from the previous weeks. Household plastics and storage also remained low in supply over the past month, with an average of 21% of products out of stock.

The industry-wide decisions to roll back the number of certain items consumers can purchase comes as coronavirus infections top 10 million across the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Meanwhile, the number of reported deaths has also ticked up, with more than 1,000 deaths reported on Saturday for the fifth day in a row, a trend that is reemerging from August.

While grocery stores take action to mitigate another empty shelf crisis, consumers are also responding. A new survey from Inmar Intelligence shows that roughly 57% of shoppers are considering restocking in fear of a “potential second wave of COVID-19” and the consequent vacant grocery store shelves.

Thousands of Americans flooded streets of major cities, including New York City, Washington and Philadelphia, to celebrate Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who claimed victory on Saturday night.

While many were wearing masks, the crowds tended to violate social distancing guidelines that have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Concha asked on Monday where the headlines were throughout the weekend on the different networks blasting those events in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington as ‘superspreaders.’

“The ‘Oh, everybody was wearing masks’ argument, yeah, it doesn’t really help when you have thousands of people all jammed together singing and screaming,” he added. “Suddenly the masks might not be quite as effective.”

BIDEN PREACHES UNITY, PROMISES TO ADDRESS CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IN FIRST SPEECH AS PRESIDENT-ELECT

Biden had made fighting the coronavirus a central message in his campaign, saying it would be a top priority in his administration. His campaign declined to hold large-scale campaign rallies and criticized President Trump for bringing thousands of people together for rallies.

Concha noted on Monday that so far Biden has not addressed concerns that some celebrations of his projected victory may contribute to the spread of coronavirus and said the former vice president “has a responsibility here” as “the president-elect.”

“He needs to lead by example,” Concha said. “His central campaign theme was we’re going to get COVID under control. OK, so you have to step up here, Mr. Biden, and say, ‘OK, I appreciate your support at all these rallies outside, but we’re now eclipsing 100,000 cases per day, so while I appreciate your support, at the same time, this needs to stop.’”

As of Monday afternoon, the United States has reported 10,042,654 coronavirus cases and more than 237,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

“Joe Biden talks about unity, he talks about bringing the country together, but he has to start, even though he isn’t sworn in yet, that won’t happen for two months, he still has a voice, he needs to step up to the microphones and say ‘that must stop,’” Concha said, referring to large gatherings.

“He ought to go as far until we know exactly what happened,” the former Arkansas governor told ""America's Newsroom.""

“How was it that 450,000 ballots in five states only had Joe Biden and not one single person down-ballot even marked. That is highly unusual,” Huckabee said.

JUSTICE ALITO: MAIL-IN BALLOTS RECEIVED AFTER ELECTION DAY IN PENNSYLVANIA MUST BE KEPT SEPARATE

Meanwhile, Trump is planning to bring back his large-scale rallies that were a hallmark of his presidential run, but these will be focused on his “ongoing litigation” as he challenges the results of last week’s election, Fox News is told.

According to a report by Axios and confirmed by Fox News, Trump's campaign plans to take a less traditional path to challenge the results of the election, including holding “a series of Trump rallies” focused on the campaign's ongoing legal efforts in numerous states across the country.

But a top Trump campaign official on Monday, after the reports surfaced, said there are no plans for the president himself. “There is currently no plan for the president to hold rallies. These would be grassroots events similar to the boat parades, not presidential rallies,” the official said.

Huckabee said that there is a “real effort” to declare the race over though President Trump does not have “any reason to walk away.”

“70 million people voted for him. I think he owes it to all of us to make sure the election was fair. I am not saying it wasn’t, I don’t know. But we need to know, we have to have an answer to the questions that linger,” Huckabee said.

“The most important thing is to be able to get to the evidence. As long as people are sitting on it, not letting the observers from the Republican side even look at what was going on, have a chance to see the voting machines, examine it, we don’t have the evidence. So, you know, when people say to 'produce the evidence,' you’ve got to get to the evidence to produce it,” Huckabee said.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has issued a temporary order requiring Pennsylvania elections officials to segregate ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day.

“That’s clearly an issue that has to be resolved and it is not just for this election, it is just for the future as well,” Huckabee said.

U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick announced the arrest of Daruin Anelby Rosario, 24, who was scheduled to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christina A. Bryan at 2 p.m. on Monday, a news release by the Department of Justice said.

Rosario originally came in contact with police during a traffic stop on Nov. 5, just two days after the election, the Houston Chronicle reported. An officer with the Humble police unit said Rosario made several furtive movements and he noticed a smell of marijuana coming from the vehicle, which prompted a search, according to the paper.

75,,http://www.foxnews.com/world/europe-hunkers-down-but-also-notes-wins-against-virus-surge,Europe hunkers down but also notes wins against virus surge,"Portugal and Hungary on Monday became the latest European countries to impose curfews against the resurgent tide of coronavirus infections and deaths lashing the continent and filling its emergency wards. But glimmers of hope emerged from France, Belgium and elsewhere that tough restrictions might be starting to work.

Portugal, which like other European countries has had new cases and hospital admissions surge in recent weeks, imposed a state of emergency and ordered some 7 million people — around 70% of its population — to stay home on weeknights from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. for at least the next two weeks. They’ll be even more limited over the weekends, allowed out only in the morning until 1 p.m., unless to buy essentials at supermarkets.

“People need to comply. If they don’t, we are in a bad situation,” said Miriam Ferreira, a 44-year-old laundry worker in Lisbon.

Portugal’s government warned that the measures may be broadened and prolonged if they prove insufficient.

Hungary also imposed its strictest measures so far: an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew announced by Prime Minister Viktor Orban. All businesses must close by 7 p.m.

Other measures in Hungary mirrored those becoming depressingly familiar across Europe, including limits on eateries and sports events, family gatherings limited to 10 people and remote learning for high school and university students. The restrictions kick in Tuesday at midnight and will remain for at least 30 days.

“I know, we all know, that this will not be easy. The next weeks will be difficult. But the vaccine is within sight, we’ve got to hold out until then,” Orban said.

Last week, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced that a small amount of a Russian coronavirus vaccine would arrive in Hungary in December for final tests, with larger deliveries in January.

The French government has gradually ratcheted up from localized curfews and bar closings to what is now a full-blown nationwide lockdown, albeit with schools and essential businesses open. Health Minister Olivier Veran said early indications are that the measures may be starting to slow the latest virus surge and that it would “have flared up faster and stronger” without them.

US TOPS 10M CORONAVIRUS CASES AMID SURGE IN INFECTIONS

Still, the situation in French hospitals and nursing homes was grim, with emergency wards approaching saturation levels and some sick patients being evacuated from struggling hospitals to others that still had space. With more than 1.8 million infections since the start of the pandemic, France has Europe’s highest total of recorded cases and the fourth-highest worldwide.

Other European nations also reported the fledgling beginnings of a possible turnaround.

The Welsh government’s First Minister Mark Drakeford spoke of “some tentative early positive signs” from a 17-day lockdown that ended Monday in Wales.

“Those give us some hope,” he said, as Wales’ seven-day average for new coronavirus cases fell from 250 per 100,000 people to just under 220.

From Monday, Wales again allowed people to meet in small groups, and businesses — including pubs, restaurants and hairdressers — to reopen. But nonessential travel remains barred to and from neighbouring England, which is in the midst of a planned 28-day lockdown.

PFIZER'S CORONAVIRUS VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE: WHAT DOES A TWO-DOSE SHOT ENTAIL?

Infections in the Czech Republic have started to decline after a two-month rise to record high levels, and the number of people hospitalized also dropped below the 8,000-mark.

In hard-hit Belgium, health authorities also were confident that a partial lockdown dealt a blow to COVID-19.

Belgian hospital admissions for the virus appear to have peaked at 879 on Nov. 3, and fell to about 400 on Sunday, virologist Yves Van Laethem said. The drop follows a return to partial lockdown measures including the closure of nonessential businesses and extending a school vacation.

In Germany, the health minister said increased infections seem to be leveling off but that it’s too early to talk of a trend.

BIDEN URGES AMERICANS TO WEAR MASKS: 'NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT'

Germany is one week into a four-week partial shutdown. New infections have continued to increase, reaching a new one-day record of 23,399 on Saturday.

But Health Minister Jens Spahn said Monday “we are seeing that the momentum is flattening, that we have less strong increases.”

He added that more progress is needed and that only later this week “at the earliest” will the restrictions’ effects become visible, “if at all.”

“We don’t want less strong increases,” he said. “We have to get the figures down.”

With the continent increasingly hunkered-down, the director general of the World Health Organization said unity between countries would be key going forward.

“We might be tired of COVID-19, but it’s not tired of us. Yes, it preys on those in weaker health, but it preys on other weaknesses, too: Inequality, division, denial and wishful thinking and willful ignorance,” Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus said.

76,,http://www.foxnews.com/world/british-prime-minister-push-brexit-bill-despite-bidens-warning,British prime minister to push through Brexit bill despite Biden's Ireland warning,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to press ahead with a Brexit deal that President-elect Joe Biden has previously criticized, according to reports.

The U.K. parliament has already passed the Internal Markets Bill through the House of Commons, but the bill has been mired with controversy at every step of its development and progress.

Many prominent conservative ministers abstained during the vote and have already ruled out voting for the final version of the bill should Johnson’s government not add certain amendments, the Guardian reported: Chief concerns revolve around perceived measures that would allow the prime minister to bypass the EU-agreed Brexit deal and issues regarding the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Biden took issue with the bill over the latter issue. As a proud Catholic of Irish descent, Biden was vocal with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab during a state visit in September, according to the New York Times.

“We can’t allow the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,” Biden told Raab, saying that any potential trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. would be “contingent upon respect for the agreement.”

The Good Friday agreement was a centerpiece policy by Bill Clinton during his presidency. Signed in 1998, the bill – also known as the Belfast agreement – started the process of removing a “hard border.""

EUROPE CELEBRATES BIDEN WIN WITH FIREWORKS

The British government has long held that it would not endanger the borders between Northern and Republic of Ireland, but critics of the Internal Markets Bill allege that any threat to the free movement of goods through Northern Ireland would lead to a return of checkpoints and other ""hard border"" measures.

Initial agreements saw Northern Ireland retain a status that would allow free movement of goods with Europe, but the bill provides the prime minister the ability to interpret the meaning of such items as state aid or to overrule customs forms and imports, according to the BBC.

NEW UK BREXIT CAMPAIGN WARNS FIRMS THAT 'TIME IS RUNNING OUT' TO PREPARE FOR NO DEAL

President Donald Trump has been a staunch supporter of Johnson and Brexit, but with Biden positioned as president-elect, Johnson now faces a different political landscape in the coming months.

Biden’s more hardline stance will endanger Britain’s economic position in a post-Brexit world. The U.S. is the U.K.’s second-largest trading partner, representing around 15% of exports.

Biden’s insistence on maintaining the Good Friday agreement’s gains might be the final push to see amendments to the Internal Markets Bill.

The Times (UK) reported that Johnson has denied that his ties with Trump would endanger a working relationship with the potential Biden presidency, but how his government progresses with the bill will indicate what kind of “special relationship” the U.K. and U.S. might see in the coming years."

Travous explained that the child was taken into protective custody early on Saturday morning, revealing that the youngster was ""exhausted"" after being awake for much of the night. From there, the little one was in the care of law enforcement officers for over six hours, who did all they could to make the kiddo feel safe and secure.

Correctional Officer Litteken bought the child diapers, clean clothes and a stuffed animal with her own money, the acting chief deputy said. Detective McClaren watched cartoons with the child in the office’s telecommunications center, where the youngster eventually fell asleep. Deputy Davis, who took the child into police protection, also spent the morning with the little one, until a family member was able to take over custody.

“I don't write this to toot our own horn, but to try and show what sheriff offices and police departments all over the country do every day,” Travous argued. “The national press would rather fixate on the negative. I'm here to tell you, 99.9% of sheriff's deputies and police officers, are just like Detective McClaren, Deputy Davis and Correctional Officer Litteken.

Election Cake used to be a tradition as American as, well, voting.

Originally, the unique leavened cake, which typically calls for sourdough starter, was called “muster cake” and was created by colonial women to feed to incoming troops who were ordered for military training by the British. (Some early colonists also called them ""great cakes,"" after a similar dessert served in England, the New England Historical Society notes.)

The dense cake was served to militia men, as well as onlookers who flooded villages to watch the military drills.

However, after the American Revolution, the boozy fruit-and-spice cake became better known as Election Cakes, after women would bring the baked goods to polling places for the white men, who were allowed to vote at the time, to eat.

The first recorded recipe for the patriotic confection was written in 1796 by Amelia Simmons in her second edition book, ""American Cookery,"" according to Bon Appetit. The recipe required 30 quarts of flour, 10 pounds of butter, 14 pounds of sugar and three dozen eggs, among spices, alcohol and 12 pounds of raisins. Several different recipes for Election Cake have since been logged, calling for different ingredients, though all seemingly have the same yeast base.

Women – who were not allowed to vote before 1920 – had allegedly also used the cakes as a way to sway the men to vote in line to their interests.

Beyond a political ploy, however, the cake was used as a celebration for the democratic process. At the time, Election Day was a holiday reportedly as large and important as any.

Election Cake has steadily declined in popularity since the early 20th century; some speculate the waning interest is due to a dissatisfaction with politics as years went on. And the cake never really caught on outside of New England states.

But in the past few years, especially during the 2016 election, the special Election Cake made a resurgence with bakeries vowing to “Make America Cake Again.”

Susannah Gebhart, baker and owner of Ashville, N.C., outpost Old World Levain Bakery, is credited with coining the phrase, and was joined in 2016 by San Francisco café Craftsman + Wolves’ owner William Werner, as well as other bakers, in a push to bring Election Cake back. They even shared her own recipe online, for anyone attempting an Election Cake at home.

“[Election cakes] were intended to be served to the masses, to people who were celebrating the democratic process and the election,” Gebhart said in a 2016 interview to NPR.

According to social media, Gebhart’s cakes were a hit with customers who stopped by in 2016, but the bakery isn't selling any ahead of the 2020 election — rather, the shop is taking a page out of history and giving away slices.

""We decided this year that we would not sell election cakes, but instead give them away,"" Gebhart told Fox News this week. ""We're offering free and by-donation slices to people at the farmers market who have voted. All donations that we collect are going to the Buncombe County chapter of the League of Women Voters.""

Arrowhead Stadium will be filled at 22% capacity with 16,000 fans at the maximum being allowed into the building.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HIGHLIGHT GAMEDAY EXPERIENCE WHEN ATTENDING HOME GAMES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

One school district in Missouri took issue with the Chiefs being allowed to have 16,000 fans in the stands while high schools are only allowed to have 100. The Blue Springs High School was issued a warning on breaking capacity limits for a sporting event at the end of August and could face a ban if the limit is broken again, according to FOX 4 KC.

Dr. Rex Archer, the Kansas City health director, told the station that the difference between a professional NFL game having thousands of fans during a pandemic versus a high school event comes down to hours and hours of extensive planning and manpower.

“Just because the Chiefs have the resources to do this in a relatively safe matter doesn’t mean that a high school stadium does,” Archer told FOX 4 KC.

Archer said he supported the limit on the number of fans at schools and contended that having fans at a larger event space like Arrowhead Stadium could be safer than having fans in a bar or crowded living room.

“We want to give it a try. There’s no guarantee we will even have the second game if this doesn’t work, but we thought it was worth trying,” he said.

The Chiefs laid out specific planning on their website for fans.

Seating and high-traffic areas of the stadium have been modified to support social distancing standards, and all concessions, retail points of sale and parking tollbooths will be cashless. All bags will be prohibited inside the stadium, and everyone must wear a mask at all times except when eating or drinking.

The Chiefs ask that fans “be patient and understand that these are unprecedented times.”

“We are all in this together so let's work with one another to keep Chiefs Kingdom safe by adhering to the guidelines outlined,” the Chiefs said."

The first matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans in a rematch of their divisional round playoff game from last season's playoffs. The Texans blew a giant lead to the Chiefs and allowed Kansas City to win the game, 51-31.

Sunday’s marquee game is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers debut of Tom Brady who is facing Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. It’s a battle of two of the best quarterbacks in NFL history and will surely be one of the best matchups to watch.

Monday night features two games: the New York Giants vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos vs. the Tennessee Titans.

The Chiefs and the Texans will square off in the first game of the 2020 season.

86,,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2020-nfl-season-what-to-know,2020 NFL season: Everything you need to know ahead of kickoff,"The 2020 NFL season might be the most anticipated in recent memory.

The Kansas City Chiefs are coming off a magical season in which Patrick Mahomes led the team to its second Super Bowl championship in dramatic fashion over the San Francisco 49ers.

Both teams got back to work after the clock hit triple zeroes in Miami. But along with the other 30 teams in the league, had to face the uncertainty regarding the coronavirus pandemic which has claimed the lives of thousands and even affected some NFL players directly.

The pandemic forced the NFL to hold a virtual draft for the first time in history. Most of the seven rounds took place from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s basement. Fans got to peer into rookies’ homes to see how they were celebrating and even got to witness a few general managers at work.

After the draft was over, the NFL held virtual minicamps and eventually canceled the preseason in hopes of being more prepared to deal with the unknown come September when the Chiefs and the Houston Texans kick-off.

In the midst of the pandemic, there were also some offseason shakeups.

Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Cam Newton joined the New England Patriots. Mahomes, Chris Jones, and Travis Kelce received lucrative contract extensions. Several coaches were fired and hired.

All roads have led to Sept. 10 – the first game of the 2020 season and the start of the journey to Tampa, Fla., where Super Bowl LV will take place.

With Joe Biden on his way to the White House, can we show our goods again in the storefront, confident that “largely peaceful” protesters won’t loot the place or burn it down?

We thought we’d ask on behalf of America’s urban shopkeepers, from Beverly Hills to Manhattan, who had boarded up their windows in anticipation of post-election violence. In the event, Mr. Biden has won the election pending recounts and, what do you know, there was little or no violence. Instead the streets were filled Saturday with partisans celebrating the democratic result they wanted.

The Trump supporters stayed home. No doubt they are disappointed, perhaps even angry. But perhaps they are also accepting the results as unfortunate though the price of living in a democratic republic. Sometimes your candidate loses.

Would it have been the same if Donald Trump had won? You know the answer. The protests would have been ugly, perhaps worse even than earlier this year. And the media and many Democratic politicians would have cheered them on, or at least not objected as they also failed to object this summer. They would have blamed the disorder on Mr. Trump.

88,,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/republicans-fight-every-vote-counted-harmeet-dhillon,Harmeet Dhillon: Republicans fight to ensure every legal vote is counted,"While vote tallies continue, President Trump is pushing ahead with legal challenges, and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Sunday he expects to have four or five more lawsuits over alleged voter fraud in battleground states filed by the end of the week.

Here's a rundown of the challenges being pursued in the 2020 campaign between the president and former Vice President Joe Biden.

In the face of historic and unprecedented irregularities in the counting of votes in swing states including Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania, Republican lawyers are suing to ensure the integrity of this election, and to give the public comfort that every legal vote has been counted – legal being a critical adjective the Biden/Harris campaign have conspicuously left out of their public statements on this election.

PENNY NANCE: 2020 ELECTION'S ONLY WAVE – REPUBLICAN WOMEN DOUBLE NUMBERS IN THE HOUSE

The Trump campaign and state GOP organizations have filed lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, as well as new lawsuits in Pennsylvania, where the U.S. Supreme Court has requested Democrats respond to a motion by the Trump campaign to intervene in an earlier suit over Pennsylvania’s decision to keep accepting new mail-in ballots for three days after Election Day, in violation of state law.

This dispute is still pending before the Supreme Court, where the week before the election the court deadlocked 4-4 with Justice John Roberts joining liberal justices in declining to grant an injunction, while newly-seated Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate, citing lack of time to prepare.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

The Trump camp expects that if the high court takes up the case again, Barrett will participate in the vote so that there is a clear decision on the constitutional question: may a state official or even a state court change a state election law that governs the date by which ballots must be received – Election Day, in Pennsylvania – when the Constitution requires that only state legislatures fix that deadline?

Republicans seek to ensure that every single valid vote be counted in exactly the way the law demands.

In addition, private, nonpartisan groups such as the Thomas More Center’s Amistad Project are suing in Michigan and Pennsylvania over specific allegations of election law violations that could affect the outcome of these critical vote tallies.

On Saturday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Arizona alleging that Maricopa County elections officials gave the wrong guidance to in-person voters who may have had a so-called “overvote” on their ballots, which could be a stray mark, paper defect or mistaken marking of two choices instead of one.

Instead of correcting their ballots with the voter still there, officials apparently unfamiliar with new voting machines instructed the voters to hit an override green button on the machines that caused their votes to be discarded. Given that the race had tightened to an under 19,000 vote difference on Nov. 7, with over 100,000 votes remaining to be counted, such errors could determine the outcome of the race in Arizona.

In several states the margin between the candidates is less than 1% – and if there is even a 1-2% error rate in counting ballots – particularly in states where massive first-time vote-by-mail numbers may have overwhelmed election officials who failed to verify signatures, receipt dates or other irregularities, recounts, audits or court-ordered remedies may well affect the outcome of more than one state.

Democrats charge that Republican lawsuits are intended to “stop the counting of votes” – but the opposite is true. When these Democrat officials – who stopped reporting votes in the middle of the night as Donald Trump was accumulating a victory margin – talk about the Constitution, they are gaslighting the American people.

Republicans seek to ensure that every single valid vote be counted in exactly the way the law demands.

Republicans seek to ensure that every single valid vote be counted in exactly the way the law demands. Why would election officials in multiple locations controlled by Democrats seek to block Republican poll watchers’ view of the counting process? There is no valid reason for this.

Republicans are fighting for our legal right to observe these counts as massive dumps of improbably Biden-heavy ballots continued to turn up and be counted by Democrat poll workers and election officials in Democrat-run cities, including Philadelphia and Detroit – both of which are notorious for election shenanigans. In Philadelphia, the Commonwealth Court sided with Republicans challenging barriers to poll-watchers, but city officials ignored the court order for several hours and continued counting the ballots while keeping Republicans too far away to observe.

The Amistad Project’s Michigan lawsuit contains first-hand, eyewitness accounts of Democrat election observers illegally filling out new ballots for votes that machines could not read without the participation of Republican observers. These and more irregularities require redress before a vote can be certified.

The Amistad Project also filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania alleging that poll workers in heavily-Democratic districts gave incorrectly filled-out ballots back to Democrat activists to “fix” them – while Republicans were kept far away and could not witness the “fixing.” These actions, taken with the approval of Pennsylvania’s Democrat secretary of state, violate established Pennsylvania election law. Moreover, because the last-minute nature of this announcement – less than 24 hours before polls closed – prevented rural counties from taking full advantage of the new process, it likely violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection, even if this abrupt rule change might otherwise be valid.

These gross errors – or worse – will require court resolution before the public can have any faith in the election results in Pennsylvania.

The irregularities discussed above are just the tip of the iceberg. Every indication suggests there is far more illegal activity waiting to be documented and challenged: poll workers wearing Biden-Harris campaign gear as they tabulate votes, reports from Michigan that hundreds of Trump mail-in ballots were “misplaced,” and thousands more Trump votes excluded from counts by election software problems in Michigan – software used in several other swing states as well. Are there more “glitches” in ballot tabulations that have been hidden from public view?

Credible reports of outright fraud are even more disturbing, including postal workers being told to backdate late ballots, and even long-dead Michigan residents being listed on the state’s election website as having not just received postal ballots, but having also completed and returned them from beyond the grave.

Every valid vote must be counted in the manner prescribed by law. We knew months ago – when Democrats launched an all-out effort to loosen election safeguards using the COVID pandemic as their excuse – that it might take a protracted effort to reach that outcome. Republican lawyers' fears were well-founded, and we are now fighting the fight we knew might come.

In the courts and in the ballot counting rooms themselves, we will not rest until we secure what the Constitution guarantees to the American people: a fair election where all the legal ballots were counted, correctly.

A source close to the No Doubt rocker, 51, told People magazine in this week’s issue that the country star, 44, reached out to Stefani’s children before getting down on one knee and proposing to his longtime love.

Stefani and her ex-husband, Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale, share three sons: Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, 6.

“Blake told her boys that he wanted to propose and ask their permission,” the source alleged to the outlet. “Her family very much approves of him. He’s an amazing partner and a great dad to the boys. Gwen is ecstatic. The proposal was a surprise.”

GWEN STEFANI, BLAKE SHELTON ANNOUNCE ENGAGEMENT: 'I HEARD A YES'

According to the insider, the couple kept their announcement private for several days before sharing it with the world on Oct. 27 via Instagram. The source said the pair were “very excited” to unveil their joyful joint announcement where Stefani proudly showed off her engagement ring.

The couple began dating in 2015 after appearing on “The Voice” together as coaches the previous year. They've since appeared together on the singing competition several times, with Shelton having been a host since Season 1.

In 2015, Stefani announced her split from Rossdale, 55, after 20 years together. The news came just weeks after Shelton and his ex-wife, country singer Miranda Lambert, finalized their divorce after four years of marriage.

The duo has since released music together such as the song “Happy Anywhere.” Stefani and Shelton also duet on the tracks ""Go Ahead And Break My Heart,"" ""You Make It Feel Like Christmas"" and ""Nobody But You.""

The couple, who already spend most of their time living together on Shelton’s Oklahoma property with Stefani’s kids, have discussed getting engaged several times in the past, often noting that they were content to continue just dating one another.

The pair got candid about their future in a recent interview with Gayle King for a CBS special ahead of the Grammys, where they performed their duet ""Nobody But You.""

King, 65, put the two on the spot by asking where they see themselves in the next 10 years, and it turns out the country crooner has no hesitation about continuing to be by Stefani's side.

""I have a lot of kids, so I see myself, like, at a lot of football games,"" Stefani, 51, said at the time, via Taste of Country.

Shelton hinted that he plans to follow in his girlfriend's footsteps.

""In the next 10 years, I see myself in the exact same scenario,"" Shelton responded.

This was hardly the first time they cleverly dodged questions about a potential engagement. At the Grammy Awards, Shelton was directly asked why he hadn’t put a ring on her finger yet, to which Stefani let him off the hook by noting that she’s already wearing plenty of hand jewelry. However, that didn’t stop her from professing her affection for the country crooner.

“He saved my entire life,” she exclaimed on the Grammys red carpet. “Not only that, just … everyone was like, ‘how was your drive over?’ It’s like, ‘wonderful, I was with Blake Shelton. He just makes me laugh and smile, he's just the greatest guy.'”

The announcement is in keeping with a promise that Stefani made in 2019 after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring that many mistook for an engagement ring.

“It might be a real ring, a real diamond, but it's not a wedding ring. No, no,” Stefani told E! News at the time.

“When I have something to say, I’ll say it,” she added.

Joining this elite group might sound impossible to a lot of people, but it's far more accessible than many realize. Below, I'll explain how you can get there by saving just $405 a month.

HERE'S THE AVERAGE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT IN 2021

Investing is key

While investing isn't the only way to become a millionaire, it is one of the most well-traveled paths because it enables you to grow your savings at a much faster pace than they could grow if you relied exclusively upon a savings account. This is especially true for those who leave their savings invested for decades.

If you invested $405 per month for 40 years and you earned an average 7% annual rate of return during that time, you would have a little over $1 million, despite only contributing $194,400 of your own money. The remaining $805,600 would come from investment earnings.

This is just one example of how investing can help you become a millionaire, but in practice, you may need to save a little more or less each month to achieve this goal. If you only have 20 years left in the workforce, for example, you'd need to save about $1,971 per month to go from $0 to $1 million in that timespan, assuming a 7% average annual rate of return.

3 RIDICULOUSLY EASY WAYS TO RETIRE WEALTHIER

You'd also need to save a little more if your average rate of return was lower. If you saved diligently over 40 years but only earned a 6% average annual rate of return, you'd need to save about $525 per month to reach $1 million.

You can't control how much your investments grow in a given year, but you can keep things moving in a positive direction by ensuring your funds are well diversified, so that a single poorly performing investment doesn't hurt your portfolio too much. You should also look for investments with low fees, so you hold onto more of the money you're earning every year.

Starting early is also key if you want to make your path to $1 million as easy as possible. The investments you make while you're young have the longest time to grow before you need to withdraw your funds, so they tend to see the most investment earnings. Your later contributions are still valuable, but you may need to set aside more per month if you have fewer years to save because you won't be able to count on as much investment earnings.

How to become a millionaire retiree

Even for investors, saving $1 million takes time, and many may not get there until retirement. If you don't anticipate using your savings before then, it makes the most sense to keep it in a retirement account.

Consider a 401(k) if your company offers one, especially if it matches some of your contributions. This reduces how much you personally need to contribute. You may put up to $19,500 in a 401(k) in 2020, or $26,000 if you're 50 or older. These limits remain the same for 2021.

HALF OF RETIREES WISH THEY'D BUDGETED MORE FOR THIS

If a 401(k) isn't an option for you, you may open an IRA with any broker online. These have lower contribution limits -- $6,000 in 2020, or $7,000 if you're 50 or older -- but you have a greater variety of investment choices than you do with a 401(k).

There are usually penalties for withdrawing money from retirement accounts under age 59 1/2 unless you qualify for certain exceptions, like paying for a large medical bill. The government has waived the early withdrawal penalty for 2020 due to the pandemic, but it's likely to return in future years.

If you think you may retire before 59 1/2 or that you may want to tap some of your savings before then, stash some money in a taxable brokerage account. These accounts don't give you the same tax savings as retirement accounts, but you can withdraw your money at any time without penalty. Plus, if you hold your savings for longer than one year, your earnings become subject to long-term capital gains tax instead of income tax, and that can save you a little money.

A $1 million nest egg may sound like a lot of money, but with retirement lasting 30 years or more for some people, you may require even more than this to live comfortably. So rather than just choosing an arbitrary number for your retirement savings, make sure you base your savings goal on how much you expect to spend in retirement. Then, you can use a retirement calculator to estimate how much you must save per month and how much you'll earn in investment earnings between now and your chosen retirement date.

102,,http://www.foxbusiness.com/money/10-states-disbursing-huge-social-security-checks,10 states disbursing huge Social Security checks,"It's no secret: Social Security is a foundational program for our nation's retired workers. Each month, the program pays out benefits to nearly 65 million people, 46.1 million of whom are retirees. Of these retirees, 62% rely on their monthly payouts to account for at least half of their income. Suffice it to say, elderly poverty rates would be through the roof without Social Security.

Continue Reading Below

Given this persistent reliance by seniors on their guaranteed monthly benefit, it's important to net the biggest payout possible. Interestingly, though, this benefit can differ greatly depending on where a retired worker lives.

4 UNEXPECTED SOURCES OF RETIREMENT INCOME

How does the Social Security Administration calculate retired worker benefits?

Before digging into the details as to why average monthly payouts can be so different between states, let's first look at the four major factors that are used to determine a workers' full retirement benefit.

The first two factors are linked at the hip: work history and earnings history. The Social Security Administration (SSA) takes your 35 highest-earning, inflation-adjusted years into account when determining what you'll receive monthly at full retirement age. For every year less of 35 worked, the SSA averages a $0 into your benefit calculation.

The third factor that plays a key role in deciphering your retirement benefit is your birth year. That's because your birth year is responsible for determining your full retirement age -- i.e., the age where you become eligible to receive 100% of your monthly payout. Without getting too far into the weeds, imagine your full retirement age as a line in the sand. Claiming benefits prior to reaching this line means accepting a permanent reduction to your monthly payout. Conversely, waiting to claim until after this line can yield a larger monthly payout.

HALF OF RETIREES WISH THEY'D BUDGETED MORE FOR THIS

The fourth and final determinant is your claiming age. Retired worker benefits can begin at age 62 or any point thereafter. The hook is that monthly benefits increase by as much as 8% annually, through age 69, for each year a retiree holds off on taking their payout.

This combination of work/earnings data and decision-making is what goes into determining your monthly benefit at full retirement age.

Beneficiaries in these 10 states are raking in big bucks

However, where you live can have a pretty big impact on what you'll receive during retirement. Earlier this year, the SSA released a mountain of supplemental data for the program, including a percentage distribution by dollar amount for retired workers in all 50 states, as of December 2019.

3 RIDICULOUSLY EASY WAYS TO RETIRE WEALTHIER

For the roughly 45.1 million retired workers netting a payout last December, the average monthly benefit was $1,502.85. But for the following 10 states, between 24% and 30.5% of retired workers were receiving at least $500 more on a monthly basis than the national average. These 10 states are:

New Jersey: 30.5% of all retired workers receiving a Social Security benefit

Connecticut: 30%

Maryland: 27.3%

Massachusetts: 27%

New Hampshire: 26.2%

Delaware: 25.9%

Washington: 25%

Utah: 24.5%

Colorado: 24.1%

New York: 24%

For some context here, 21.5% of all retired workers paid nationally received at least $2,000 in December 2019, with Mississippi bringing up the caboose (15.3% of all monthly beneficiaries received $2,000 or more).

3 SOCIAL SECURITY BASICS EVERY INVESTOR MUST KNOW

Here's why Social Security benefits are naturally higher in some states

Now for the $64,000 question: Why is it that roughly a quarter or more of the retirees in each of these states is bringing home at least $6,000 in annual Social Security retirement benefits above the national average?

The most logical answer boils down to income. As I pointed out, earnings history plays a critical role in determining how much a worker will collect in retirement. A worker who earns more should collect more, assuming they worked for 35 years. Among these 10 states, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Washington respectively rank No. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 10 in median household income by state. Colorado, Utah, Delaware, and New York all rank within the top 15. Since workers are earning more in these states, it's only logical that they're receiving a larger monthly payout during retirement.

You'll also note that many of these states feature a high cost of living. While I don't want to reduce the importance that certain well-paying industries play in attracting talent to certain states, it also can't be overlooked that businesses in these 10 states may simply be upping what they pay their employees because it's costly to live there.

According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 9 out of 10 of these states (Utah being the exception) features a cost of living that ranges between 5.6% (Colorado) and 39.1% (New York) above the national average. Thus, even though 24% of retired New York beneficiaries are receiving $2,000 or more each month, it's not a guarantee that their payout is getting them very far.

A final postulation as to why there are so many big checks being disbursed in these 10 states has to do with claiming age. It's possible that workers with higher incomes are able to save and invest more of their money, putting them in better financial position when they retire. This would mean less need to take benefits early at a reduced rate. Being able to wait to take benefits until age 67 to 70 is a surefire formula to pump up your monthly payout.

There are simple ways to increase your money fast — like opening a high-yield savings account (HYSA).

Continue Reading Below

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the savings rate, or the portion of personal income that goes into savings, has risen to 25.7%, which is up from 9.5% last quarter. With a high-yield savings account, you can earn more interest and save money. Let your savings account do the heavy lifting for you, and open up an account today.

Read on to learn more about high-yield savings accounts and how much they pay.

What is a high-yield savings account?

A high-yield savings account functions similarly to a traditional savings account. It's a place where you can put money aside to build an emergency fund, for a down payment, to save up for another big purchase or for any other reason.

However, the big difference between an HYSA and a traditional savings account is the former comes with much higher interest rates, which means that you can earn money faster.

The interest rate on an HYSA is expressed as the annual percentage yield, or APY. In general, the higher the annual percentage yield is on an account, the more interest your money will earn. It's important to note these interest rates are variable and can change at any time. They're tied to the benchmark interest rate set by the Federal Reserve and will go up and down.

4 THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SAVE MONEY WITHIN MINUTES

How much does a high-yield savings account pay?

The main benefit of opening an HYSA is the amount of interest that you stand to earn.

While the national average for the APY on a traditional savings account is just 0.06%, HYSAs tend to have annual percentage yields over 1%, which is over ten times the savings rate.

How much interest will I earn on $1,000 a year in a high-yield savings account?

At a savings rate of 0.06%, a deposit of $1,000 would earn you just $0.60 worth of interest in a year's time. In contrast, at a rate of 1%, the same $1,000 deposit would earn $10.

You could earn even more if your deposit amount was higher or if you find an account with a higher APY. No matter what your deposit amount is, you can still save more in the long run with a high-yield savings account. Check out what options are available to you right now.

Should I open a high-yield savings account?

Deciding whether to open a high-yield savings account is a personal choice. There are some obvious pros and cons to opening a high-yield savings account — and that partially depends on your financial situation and what you're hoping to get out of it.

Keep in mind HYSAs aren't without their drawbacks:

Some have minimum balance requirements while others include a monthly service fee.

HSYAs are subject to the Federal Reserve's Regulation D , which limits the number of times you can make a withdrawal from your account to just six times per month.

To that end, one of the best money tips that financial experts often have to offer on the subject is to research any account you're thinking of opening, beyond just looking at the APY. Be sure to read the fine print and make sure you understand any fees that you'll be charged, as well as any existing requirements.

HOW ARE HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL?

How to open a high-yield savings account

Most of the time, opening a high-yield savings account is similar to opening a traditional savings account. Typically, all you have to do is fill out an application detailing your personal information and your financial history before making your initial deposit.

Credible can explain the process of opening a high-yield savings account via an online bank. Follow these steps to open up a high-yield savings account and save more money now.

Here are some things you may need in order to open an HYSA:

An initial deposit (you may have to make an initial deposit of a certain size)

A minimum balance (you’ll need to keep a certain amount in the account at all times)

Other ways to save money

Keep in mind that there are other ways to save money, including:

Paying down credit card debt

Budgeting or building emergency funds

Refinancing existing loans

Paying down your credit card debt: Not only will this help you save on the amount of interest that you pay overall, but it will lower your credit utilization rate, which will raise your credit score.

Budgeting or building emergency funds: Once you covered all of your expenses, any excess money that you have to spare during the coronavirus pandemic could go to building an emergency fund that’s meant to cover unexpected expenses.

Refinancing existing loans: You could also consider refinancing your existing loans in order to take advantage of current interest rates. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates twice since March — and homeowners and student loan borrowers are taking advantage.

If you're a homeowner and are interested in refinancing your mortgage, check out the multi-lender marketplace Credible. You can compare mortgage lenders and loan rates to find the best refinance offers (with the goal of saving money in mind).

If you're drowning in student debt, you can also use Credible to compare student loan refinancing rates from up to 10 lenders without affecting your credit. Plus, it's 100% free!"

106,,http://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-columnist-media-trump-saved-democracy,Washington Post columnist says media 'never fully learned how to cover Trump' but 'might have saved democracy',"Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan suggested that her journalist peers ""never fully learned how to cover"" President Trump but ""might have saved democracy"" following his projected defeat against Joe Biden.

""Over the past four or five years, I’ve been sharply critical of the media, including that subset I like to call the 'reality-based press,'"" Sullivan wrote on Sunday. ""My continuing complaint has been that mainstream journalism never quite figured out how to cover President Trump, the master of distraction and insult who craved media attention and knew exactly how to get it, regardless of what it meant for the good of the nation.""

Sullivan indicated that the press was too obedient of the ""deeply abnormal president,"" writing ""When he said 'jump,' journalists all too often said 'how high?'"" and that the media ""constantly sought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time he sounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming 'presidential.'""

MEDIA OUTLETS FALSELY CLAIM LONDON FIREWORKS, PARIS CHURCH BELLS WERE CELEBRATING BIDEN VICTORY

""From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies and speeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem. And we took far too long to call his falsehoods what they often were: lies. And far too long to call his worldview what it clearly was: racist. Instead, we danced around — for years — with euphemisms like 'misstatements' and 'racially tinged comments,'"" Sullivan explained. ""Maybe worst of all, we employed the time-honored method of treating both sides of a controversy as roughly equal. This might have been fine at an earlier moment of history. But it was almost criminally misleading in the Trump era, particularly when it came to the coverage of his Republican enablers in Washington.""

The media columnist went on to insist despite being ""flawed,"" the mainstream media ""managed to tell us who Trump is,"" and that ""the best of the Trump-era journalism has been crucial, true to its democratic mission of holding the powerful accountable.""

""Without the reality-based press, whatever its flaws and shortcomings, we would be utterly lost,"" Sullivan concluded.

MSNBC REPORTEDLY LETS JON MEACHAM GO AS CONTRIBUTOR AFTER NOT DISCLOSING HE WAS A SPEECHWRITER FOR BIDEN

The Post raised eyebrows among conservatives on social media while sharing the column, tweeting the headline, ""The media never fully learned how to cover Trump. But they still might have saved democracy.""

""Media during the last four years, captured perfectly in one tweet entirely bereft of self-awareness,"" Resurgent commentator Drew Holden reacted.

""The media congratulates the media for its hostility to voters. I don't think this is a plus for democracy,"" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway tweeted.

""Am I a hero? I can't really say, but yes,"" Washington Free Beacon's David Rutz said, quoting Michael Scott from ""The Office.""

A number of users reported that, when they asked Siri the question about the president’s age, they were given details for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

“Ask Siri, ‘How old is the president?’ And she answers, ‘Kamala is 56.’ How’d that happen?!” tweeted ABC 7 News reporter Dan Noyes.

ON ELECTION NIGHT, GOOGLE SEARCHES FOR 'LIQUOR STORE NEAR ME' WERE AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH

The apparent error, however, was resolved. On Monday morning, when Fox News asked Siri the same question, the voice assistant provided the correct answer: “Donald Trump is 74 years old.”

Fox News has reached out to Apple with a request for comment on this story.

Harris made history as the first Black woman to be elected vice president. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government.

For millions of Christians across our nation, this is a bitter pill to swallow.

President Trump’s strong policies on life and religious liberty would have seemed, from our vantage point, to be a better path for our country’s future. Many of you may be asking: What is God doing in this outcome? Why would He allow this to happen?

In January 2016 — a year before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president — I was flying around Iowa with the then-businessman to campaign with him before the Iowa caucuses.

BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY, TRUMP DENIED SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE, FOX NEWS PROJECTS

We had just finished our elegant lunch of Wendy’s cheeseburgers when I said to him: “Mr. Trump, I believe you are going to be the next president of the United States and if that happens it will be because God has a great plan for you and for our nation.”

“Robert, do you really believe that?” he asked.

“Yes sir, I do,” I replied.

Donald Trump then asked: “OK, if that’s true then let me ask you a question. Do you believe it was God’s will for Obama to be president?”

“Yes sir I do,” I said. “Daniel 2:21 says that ‘It is God who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings.’”

Human governments and rulers change at God’s direction and design. Our faith and our salvation lie not in any human ruler, but in the ruler of rulers, the King of kings. We have to remember that even though the occupant of the White House is changing, the One who occupies the throne of Heaven hasn’t changed.

The fact that God has established authorities means that by obeying the government, we obey God.

The Apostle Paul told us: “Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God” (Romans 13:1).

Paul also told us to pray “for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions” (1 Timothy 2:1-2).

Now, it’s always easier to submit and to pray for someone when he was our preferred candidate. But the rubber really meets the road when the person who takes office is not the one we supported. Paul didn’t give us any wiggle room — his command applies all the same, whether the emperor was the faith-friendly Constantine or the evil emperor Nero.

Here is our chance to show that Christians are not hypocrites. We serve a God who remains on His throne, sovereignly reigning over every square inch of this vast universe. We serve a God who loves us and will never leave or forsake us. And now we have the chance to show the consistency and constancy/ of our Christian witness to this world.

When Joe Biden becomes president, we should commend him for the things he does right. We should condemn the things he does wrong. And above all, we must pray fervently for our president.

If President Biden succeeds, we all succeed. May God bless Joe Biden, and may God bless the United States of America.

109,,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/steve-mcqueen-born-again-christian-billy-graham-cancer-book,"Steve McQueen became a born-again Christian, found comfort in Billy Graham before succumbing to cancer: book","EXCLUSIVE: Steve McQueen, hailed as ""The King of Cool,"" saw the light before he succumbed to cancer.

The actor, who died on Nov. 7, 1980, at age 50, is being remembered in a new book commemorating the 40th anniversary of his death titled “Steve McQueen: In His Own Words” by Marshall Terrill.

The new release features interviews, personal letters, rarely heard reflections from audiotapes as well as more than 500 photographs, personal documents and memorabilia, many of which are being seen by the public for the first time.

Terrill, who has now written seven books on the Hollywood leading man, told Fox News the star considered doing an autobiography toward the end of his life, but cancer had ravaged his body so quickly that he never had the chance. The author believes the new book will allow the box office champion of the ‘60s and ‘70s to finally share his story.

JOHNNY CASH REMAINED DEVOTED TO HIS FAITH DESPITE DRUG WOES, WAS NEARLY KILLED BY AN OSTRICH, BOOK REVEALS

“Many of these interviews have never seen the light of day,” said Terrill. “I started this book in 2014 and it took years to compile everything together told by Steve McQueen himself. A lot of people have always written him off as just a blue-collar guy who liked motorcycles and cars. But if you read his words, the man has great wisdom to him. He’s got this rich life experience that I wanted to share with people.”

“The reality is, Steve McQueen didn’t really like talking about himself,” Terrill shared. “So when he did, there were these little flashes where he unveiled his true self.”

For the book, Terrill discovered documents that give clearer insight on who McQueen’s father was -- a man the star desperately tried to track down in his lifetime but was three months too late. According to Terrill, McQueen was on the cusp of stardom with “Wanted: Dead or Alive"" when William McQueen, a Merchant Marine, died of cirrhosis of the liver in November 1958. The patriarch was buried in an unmarked grave in Long Beach, Calif.

“I finally traced him to a small town here in California, but it was too late,” McQueen recalled. “He died three months earlier -- so we never got to see each other. His friends told me he used to watch me on TV and that he was real proud of me. But maybe they just said it because they figured I wanted to hear it… I wanted to stand in front of him, just face him squarely and ask why he left us the way he did. It did hurt my mother at the time, and it hurt me later.”

JOHNNY CASH'S FORMER MANAGER TACKLED SINGER'S DRUG BATTLES BUT QUIT OVER RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, BOOK CLAIMS

After a stint in the Marines, McQueen found refuge on the stage when he gave acting a shot in the early ‘50s. However, despite the fame and fortune he achieved in Hollywood, McQueen always yearned for something else -- and he finally found it toward the end of his life.

“In the search for his father, he was also looking for his heavenly father,” Terrill explained. “At the end of his life, he met a pilot named Sammy Mason, who was probably 10-15 years older than Steve. However, Sammy had a special presence about him. One day, Steve finally said, ‘There’s something different about you. I can’t put my finger on it.’ Sammy said, ‘Well Steve, I’m a born-again Christian.’ And from that point on, Steve wanted to emulate him.”

According to Terrill, McQueen became so intrigued by Christianity that he asked if he could go to church with Mason. McQueen met pastor Leonard DeWitt and later “grilled him for two hours” during lunch.

“Leonard said, ‘Well Steve, I only have one question for you,’” said Terrill. “[Steve] goes, ‘You want to know if I’m a born-again Christian?’ Leonard replied, ‘Yes, Steve, that’s all that really matters to me.’ And then Steve said, ‘Yes. Do you remember a couple of weeks ago when you asked everyone to bow their heads and accept Jesus Christ? Well, I closed my eyes and did that.”

STEVE MCQUEEN’S EX-WIFE NEILE ADAMS BLAMES ‘FREE LOVE’ FOR FAILED MARRIAGE

Terrill pointed out that columnist Liz Smith was the first to report that McQueen became a born-again Christian in June 1979 -- nearly six months before he was officially diagnosed with cancer.

When McQueen later learned he had a rare, normally fatal form of lung cancer, he reached out to evangelist Billy Graham.

“Steve McQueen knew he was dying,” said Terrill. “So he requested Billy Graham to come to see him. And so Billy did, right before Steve McQueen left to go to Mexico for his last operation. They were going to pray together when Steve said, ‘I don’t have my Bible.’""

""Billy Graham instinctively gave him his Bible,"" Terrill continued. ""It became Steve’s prized possession. To Steve, like many people, Billy Graham was perhaps the closest thing that you could probably get to God on Earth. I think Steve wanted to tap on his knowledge. Steve wanted to share testimony with him and what Christ did for him.”

STEVE MCQUEEN WAS PLAGUED WITH INSECURITIES CAUSED BY HIS TROUBLED CHILDHOOD, REPORT SAYS

McQueen was in a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, hospital for surgery on a massive tumor when he was stricken with a heart attack, the Los Angeles Times reported. The outlet reported the cancer had spread widely through his upper body. Terrill said when McQueen was found, he was still clutching to Graham’s Bible. McQueen died on what was Graham’s 62nd birthday.

Graham passed away in 2018 at age 99.

Terrill hopes his book will shed some light on how McQueen viewed his legacy over the years.

“Before cancer, McQueen’s outlook on life was very cynical,” said Terrill. “I think Christianity gave him comfort. He was going to announce that he was a Christian but he never got that opportunity. But he did promise that if he got well, he was going to make that announcement. He revealed that his body is gone, it’s broken, but his spirit isn’t broken and his heart isn’t broken. I think that says it all.”"
110,,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-biden-faith-election-chris-coons,Sen. Chris Coons: Joe Biden is a man of faith dedicated to serving others — as president he can heal America,"I

I’ve had the great privilege of knowing Joe Biden for 30 years. Among the many reasons I’m voting to make him our next president is that his extraordinary and selfless public service is guided by faith. He is the leader we need to heal and unite our country, and deserves your vote as well.

In 1968, Joe Biden was a young lawyer in Wilmington, Del., with his entire life ahead of him. He had recently graduated from law school and returned to his hometown, where he was clerking at one of the city’s prominent law firms. Only 25 years old, he had a clear path to a quiet, comfortable life as a successful local attorney ahead of him.

During the summer of 1968, though, the city of Wilmington saw dramatic civil unrest in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The National Guard was brought in, occupied the city for months, and a difficult, long-overdue period of conversations about racial injustice were finally taking place.

RICHARD FOWLER: AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF TRUMP’S LIES, INCOMPETENCE, IGNORANCE AND FAILURES

That’s when Joe Biden decided to take a different path in his life, began working instead as a public defender, and eventually ran for local office to begin healing his hometown.

For Joe, the fight for civil rights was a natural evolution of his upbringing, when nuns and priests taught him that all of us are made in the image of God. His mother — a tough, Irish Catholic woman named Catherine Eugenia Finnegan — taught him that nobody was better than him, but that he wasn’t better than anyone else, either.

It was Joe’s faith that inspired in him a passion for justice, a respect for the dignity of all people, and a sense of responsibility to serve his neighbors, his brothers and sisters in Christ.

What started as a run for local office in the midst of the civil rights movement turned into a remarkable public service career, and all along, the Joe Biden our country has come to know is the same Catholic kid from Delaware who wanted to right some of the wrongs he saw in his home state.

Over five decades, Joe Biden’s private life and public service have been shaped by his faith. Throughout his campaign for president, he hasn’t just talked about his faith — he’s shown it through his actions.

In a political age defined by divisiveness and vulgarity, Joe has stayed true to who he is: a man of prayerful decency and kindness.

The American people have heard Joe Biden talk about how his faith has taught him to fight for those in need and to find common ground with those with whom we disagree. They’ve seen him comfort and pray with grieving families and carry a rosary with him everywhere he goes.

It’s not just a matter of style, though. Joe’s faith also informs his views on policy. His faith inspired him decades ago to take on climate change, recognizing our role as stewards of creation. His faith has led him to work towards a more just and humane immigration policy, and it has driven him throughout his entire career to call out and confront the original sins of our nation: slavery and racism.

In early 2017, Joe Biden ended his service as vice president and he was back at home in Delaware with his family, with a remarkable career in public service now behind him. He finally had more time to spend with his beloved grandkids and energy to pour into the fight against cancer in honor of his beloved son Beau, who died of the disease.

But everything changed later that summer, when white supremacists, Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis rallied in Charlottesville, Va. —spewing hate, attacking innocent citizens, and even killing a young woman.

Joe knew then what he’s said almost every day since — that we’re in a battle for the soul of this country.

It's not only Joe Biden’s belief in God that motivates him. It’s his belief in the American people that has allowed him to run a campaign built on hope for a better future and a stubborn insistence that our country can and must heal and come back together.



Joe believes. He believes in both the greatness and the goodness of our country. He believes in us and in what we can do together. He will make a great president.

A hunter from West Virginia is hopeful that he may have set a new record after taking down a 12-point buck. It will still take some time for an official measurement to come in, however, which means no official record can be made until then.

Per Jody Dalton who joined me this morning on West Virginia Outdoors to talk about his big buck. Here is the link to... Posted by Chris Lawrence on Saturday, November 7, 2020

Jody Dalton took down the potentially-record-breaking whitetail deer while bow hunting in Wyoming county in West Virginia, West Virginia Metro News reports. The previous record was reportedly set in 2014 in McDowell County.

Dalton spoke with a local radio station, explaining that he recognized that the buck could be a new state record as soon as he saw it. The rack needs to dry for at least 60 days, however, before an official measurement can be taken. During the time period, it is possible for it to shrink.

According to Dalton, he found the deer in an area where he had hunted in past years, although he did try hunting it a little earlier in the season than he normally does. He says that he believes he first spotted the deer on a photo taken by a trail camera in late October.

On social media, McDonald’s wrote, “You guys did it. Chicken McGrill is back on popular demand in stores near you. You read it right. You win.” The message then ended by directing fans to their nearest McDonald’s or to the company’s Twitter bio, which includes a link to purchase the sandwich.

The realtor’s revelation comes after much controversy surrounding the big cat documentary “Tiger King” on Netflix.

“[My husband and I] have got full-time security. There are armed guards and canine unit dogs. We got it all because the house was featured on ‘Selling Sunset,’” Quinn said according to Daily Star. “My neighbors recognized it and called me up.”

She continued: “I realized it meant people knew where we live now. That was a little scary to me because we are here a lot. And now, when we are away, we take extra precautions.”

The realtor then revealed, “The death threats I had were terrifying.”

""We were warned that a lot of weird things were happening in the area and I joked, 'If guns and dogs don't scare people, we need a tiger,’” Quinn recalled. “Then I decided it would be really fun to do that. So we found this guy who trains tigers as pets and got one.”

Despite having the dangerous animal, the “Selling Sunset” star said when the tiger is over “he isn't even on a leash.”

Kelsey Venkov posted her video on Wednesday, which shows her walking up to a lone wooden chair that is situated next to an end table and lamp. She adds a textured rug, throw pillow and blanket and other festive items that fit a holiday theme.

“I was in Target today minding my own business until I stumbled upon this chair. It was very lonely and it needed some love,” Venkov explained in her video. “So, I took it upon myself to decorate since all the decor was right there. And people might even get ideas from it, so why not?”

She also expressed that she thought Target could potentially boost its sales if its stores staged furniture and home décor in a stylish way.

Venkov’s video has received more than 3 million views, 620,100 likes and 10,600 comments.

However, not everyone was pleased with seeing her carry out her artistic vision.

“You’ve obviously never worked a retail job omg why,” wrote one commenter.

“I’m really just thinkin about how the Target employees are probably gonna have to put it away,” another user wrote.

Steven Novak’s East Dallas property looks like a truly haunted home with bloody, butchered dummies decorating his roof, front stoop, sidewalk and lawn, the Dallas Observer reports. Novak said he was dead-set against a hokey Halloween display, and was determined to go all-out for All Hollow’s Eve.

""No lights, fog machine, or camp … something that would really freak people out walking by in the dark.”

With that as inspiration, the local artist “whipped up some dummies and slung 20 gallons of blood all over.”

Marisa Hochberg, 32, rented a house in Montauk, New York, from Cheryl Berman-Schechter and her husband Matthew Schechter, according to a report from The New York Times.

Hochberg signed a lease for June 1 to Aug. 8 and agreed to pay $31,750, The Times reported.

About two weeks into her stay, Hochberg reportedly messaged Berman-Schechter asking if she was “looking to sell” the house.

“I’ve fallen in love with it haha -- figured I’d ask!” she wrote.

Berman-Schechter told her that she was not selling the house.

Soon after that, Hochberg was supposed to make her second rent payment of $14,450. The payment was due on June 15, but Berman-Schechter never got it.

Hochberg did not immediately respond to Fox News’s request for comment.

According to The Times, Hochberg’s father called Berman-Schechter to ask if his daughter could stay past her Aug. 8 move-out date, just days before the lease was set to end.

Berman-Schechter said no -- because new tenants were coming to stay -- but she reportedly offered to help Hochberg find a new place to live.

In response, Hochberg told her landlord that she couldn’t be forced to move out because of the tenant protection laws in New York, which made it harder for landlords to evict tenants.

Those laws were intended to protect vulnerable people from being evicted during the coronavirus pandemic, but according to a May report from the New York Post, the law has been used by wealthier people who squatted in nice homes in the Hamptons.

“We were hoping things would have eased by October, but we came to the realization that [with] the way things were, it didn’t feel right to ask guests to travel to Florida or do a larger event, especially if it wasn’t going to be the way we envisioned,” the bride explained.

As for the special dress, Shriver said it was all the more sentimental that it aged with time.

“The dress has aged into a French vanilla ivory, and there are a few holes in it, but I didn’t care,” she said.

In a twist of serendipity, “the bride and her grandmother happened to be the same height and have the same size waist, so the dress fit perfectly,” according to Vogue.

Witnessing shocking or dangerous events can trigger PTSD, the FDA says, which can lead to sleep issues, among its other symptoms.

PTSD IN CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS, DOCTORS BECOMES NEW FOCUS FOR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE US

“Today’s authorization offers a new, low-risk treatment option that uses digital technology in an effort to provide temporary relief from sleep disturbance related to nightmares,” Carlos Peña, director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a news release. The device was granted through an expedited process with the FDA's so-called ""Breakthrough Devices"" program.

The newly authorized, prescription-based device is called NightWare, and through the Apple Watch, uses data on body movement and heart rate during sleep to create a sleep profile, per the release. When NightWare detects a nightmare based on its analyses, it releases gentle vibrations “to arouse but not awaken the wearer,” per the company’s webpage, to interrupt the nightmare but allow for continued sleep.

The FDA noted a randomized study on the device involving 70 patients over 30-days, which revealed improvement on sleep scales.

“Patients who have been known to 'act out' during their nightmares (sleepwalking, violence) should not use Nightware,” the FDA added.

Finally, this device should be used in combination with other treatments; it is not a standalone therapy, the agency wrote.

If you want low mortgage rates, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate. The size of your down payments also affects mortgage rates, with a low down payment likely to yield you a higher rate.

It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders to find the best rate for your financial goals. According to research from Freddie Mac, borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote — and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes.

135,,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/after-hurricane-dorian-a-layup-helped-the-bahamas-rebuild,"After Hurricane Dorian, a layup helped the Bahamas rebuild","The newly rebuilt Tabernacle Baptist Church in Freeport, Bahamas, doesn’t see as many parishioners as it would in normal times, simply because coronavirus concerns keep a number of them from venturing too far from home. So these days, the church arranges delivery of groceries, care packages, health supplies and more to those in need.

Strangers made that possible.

And it all started with a layup.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

Nathan Bain provided one of college basketball’s signature moments last season, a buzzer-beating layup in overtime to give unheralded Stephen F. Austin a stunning upset over Duke on Nov. 26. 2019. Duke was the No. 1 team in the country at the time and hadn’t lost a nonconference game on its home floor in nearly 20 years.

But that became just a sliver of the story that night. Bain's layup won a game — and rebuilt a home, rebuilt a school and rebuilt a church, all of it directly impacting the lives of hundreds of Bahamians.

“It was a game and it became a bigger cause,” Bain said. “More often than not, people want to do the right thing. And I think that’s what happened with us, that people just saw the opportunity to be good human beings.”

Bain’s family home in the Bahamas was destroyed when Hurricane Dorian slammed into the islands on Sept. 1, 2019, with wind reaching 185 mph. Their belongings were washed away. The church and school that his father has operated for decades were badly damaged. School officials at Stephen F. Austin had set up an online fundraiser to help Bain’s family; it raised $2,400 in the two months preceding the win over Duke.

But after Bain’s game-winner, word got out and donations poured in. All told, $151,740 came in from about 4,000 donors.

“A lot of people at home lost everything, lost their lives, lost family members, lost their whole life savings,” Bain said. “People had to start over from zero like they were newborns.”

Bain gave the money to his parents, who oversaw the rebuilding effort of both the church and their home. The house has been habitable since July. The church has been up and running since April.

“Without these people, there’d be no way in the world that we’d be back in our church building,” said Norris Bain, Nathan’s father. “We would still be working on the how to get that completed.”

No need, thanks to that layup.

On the day that Stephen F. Austin was playing Duke, the first international flight to Grand Bahama since the hurricane touched down. Its passengers: basketball teams from Tennessee, who came to the Bahamas for a tournament that Norris Bain organized, a first step toward normalcy for a nation that suffered more than $3 billion in damage and lost at least 74 people in the storm.

Hours after that plane landed, a loose ball just happened to roll into the hands of Nathan Bain.

“Definitely some divine intervention,” Norris Bain said. “The ball ends up in the hands of the kid who has a story to tell about a country ravaged by a storm, the type of a storm that has not been seen since the creation of this world.”

Nathan Bain is working in Texas and planning his wedding these days. He hasn’t been home to see the rebuilding. He didn’t have time to go back last season and then the pandemic struck and made international travel difficult. He couldn’t even keep his photos of the devastation; they upset him so much that he had to delete them from his phone.

“You’re going to hinder your faith when you ask questions you know you don’t have an answer to because you’re just going to keep on asking, ‘Why, why, why?’” Nathan Bain said. “There’s a process for things. Sometimes, you just have to understand there’s a bigger plan.”

And sometimes, a layup is worth much more than two points."

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo identified the fallen officer as Sgt. Sean Rios, 47, a 25-year veteran of the department. Acevedo said he leaves behind four children who are between the ages of 9 and 17 years old.

HPD conducted an escort for Sgt. Rios that began at Little York Rd at North Interstate Highway 45 under the freeway and then inbound on the service road.

A reporter Houston’s Fox 26 cited sources who said the off-duty officer was shot around 1:30 p.m. in his vehicle after pulling into the parking lot of the hotel 7600 block of North Interstate Highway 45. The officer made it to the lobby where he died, he said.

Police reportedly closed off the intersection of Interstate 45 and Gulf Freeway. Officers told motorits traveling on I-45 North to “expect delays and use alternative routes.”

They announced the arrest of David Kizziar, 67, in the murder and sexual assault of Aimee See, whose body was found three days after Valentine's Day in 1984.

Kizziar was arrested after police said his DNA matched DNA from the crime scene, according to reports. The DNA analysis was conducted last week.

""The investigation into Aimee's murder went cold, but detectives continued to review the investigation as technology changed,"" Sgt. Mercedes Fortune said, according to the Arizona Republic.

Police found See's body after an anonymous 911 call reported smoke coming from an abandoned mortuary, where people were reportedly inside, KTVK reported.

There was no smoke and the building was empty but there was a trail of blood leading to See’s body.

See was naked and lying face up on a sleeping bag, the station reported. There were injuries to her head and a phone cord was wrapped around her neck. It appeared she had been killed days before.

Just last month, the Phoenix cold case unit developed a lead identifying Kizziar as a suspect, the station reported.

Detectives then interviewed Kizziar, who told detectives he knew his way around the mortuary and that he belonged to the YMCA and St. Vincent de Paul Society when police say See belonged to the two groups, the station reported.

The detectives also obtained Kizziar's DNA.

At least 400 drivers took to the streets of Portland, Ore., to partake in “speed racing events” on Sunday night in the area of Northeast Airport Way and Northeast 122nd Avenue. Officials from Portland Police Bureau said Monday morning that street racing on Sunday nights is nothing new, but lately, “participants and spectators have been more aggressive.”

Police said people have been found to plan their meetups ahead on social media.

“There has been an uptick in street takeovers, where participants block traffic to perform stunts,” PPB said in a summary of the night’s events. “Additionally, officers have noticed a more aggressive response to police, including items thrown at officers.”

Over the course of the night, police towed 16 vehicles, and charged and jailed 14 people. Police said three juveniles were found with a stolen car, and were given a later court date and released to their parents.

CHICAGO VIOLENCE: 7 DEAD, 41 SHOT AMID BLOODY WEEKEND

At least one crash was found to have been linked to the street racing, and two others are suspected of having a connection, police said. No injuries were reported.

But Portland is not alone in sounding the alarm on the issue.

On the other side of the country, officials in Atlanta, Ga., arrested eight people, impounded five vehicles and made 164 traffic stops that resulted in 135 citations, police said.

“We will employ our resources to cite and/or arrest those involved in this illegal, dangerous, & disruptive activity,” Atlanta Police Department said in a Monday tweet.

140,,http://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-jacob-blake-kenosha-shooting-sex-assault-charge-dropped,Sex assault charge against police shooting victim Jacob Blake dropped in plea deal,"Prosecutors in Wisconsin have dropped sexual assault charges against Jacob Blake — the Black man who was left paralyzed in a police shooting that sparked protests across the nation over the summer.

Kenosha police were trying to arrest Blake in connection with the sex assault case on Aug. 23 when a cop shot him seven times in the back as he tried to duck into his SUV.

Blake had been accused of breaking into a woman’s home and sexually assaulting her in May. The case had been scheduled to go to trial on Monday.

SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES FILED AGAINST JACOB BLAKE IN JULY PROMPTED POLICE TO RESPOND BEFORE SHOOTING: UNION REPORT

As part of a plea deal, the 29-year-old copped to two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct, for which he was sentenced to two years of probation at a hearing over Zoom on Friday.

In exchange, prosecutors dropped the felony third-degree sexual assault charge and a misdemeanor criminal trespass charge against him.

During the hearing, prosecutors said that the alleged victim — who is the mother of Blake’s three sons — was not cooperating with the investigation and had walked back her claims, according to the Kenosha News.

“This was an agreement reached partly because the victim in this matter was not responsive to the subpoena to appear in court,” Walworth County District Attorney Zeke Wiedenfeld said of the plea deal.

JACOB BLAKE SEEN STRUGGLING WITH OFFICERS BEFORE BEING SHOT, NEW VIDEO SHOWS

However, Wiedenfeld said that while Blake had never been convicted of a crime as an adult, there was a long history of 911 calls from the woman accusing him of domestic violence or property disputes.

Judge Bruce Schroeder told Blake that engaging in domestic violence sets “a ghastly example for these children.”

“But your life has changed dramatically and perpetually,” Schroeder added.

“I hope that (your medical condition) will improve and that you’ll do better, but it does make unrealistic the suggestion that you be imprisoned for these cases.”

Blake, who remains paralyzed from the waist down, has been staying at a rehabilitation facility in Illinois. His lawyer said it is expected he will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his days.

An investigation into the police shooting is still ongoing. The encounter sparked days of anti-police brutality protests that turned violent at times.

During one night of demonstrations, prosecutors say 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha from nearby Antioch, Ill., and fatally shot two men and wounded a third.

He’s been charged with two counts of felony homicide, attempted homicide, possession of a dangerous weapon while under the age of 18 and reckless endangerment.

On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA) discussed where the Georgia recount stands and why President Trump continues to fight despite various sources calling the 2020 Election for Joe Biden.

""Georgia, right here, is razor, razor thin. And there's a chance that President Trump is still going to win Georgia. It's going to be extremely close. So the same is happening in Arizona. I mean, you go around the horn with these six states that are in question. It is totally irresponsible and massively immature for any network group to come out calling this race when these states are still totally up for grabs. We need every honest, true legal vote to be counted, every illegal vote to be cast out. And let's have an accurate count when all is said and done and then we go from there. But until those issues are resolved, this thing is a long ways from over.""

""He is a fighter and he has very serious concerns as to how this election has turned out. He's been warning the American public for at least six months, more than that, that this and I have too. There's been a number of us, we've been sitting in oversight committee for this entire year watching how the Democrats want to absolutely change the election process. And then COVID comes along and we have watched COVID be used as an excuse to insert into our election process all sorts of things that otherwise would never, ever be tolerated in the United States. But they have been this time. And the question is, have those things been abused? And there are certainly some indications that the answer to that question is yes. And so we need to find out where there may be some potential problems or illegal activity or votes that need to be cast out, whatever the case may be. We need to get to the bottom of this and we're a long ways from this issue being resolved."""

They lost ground with Hispanics in Texas, President Trump and Republicans gained among minorities. So it is by every measure just a catastrophe. And you saw this all across the country.""

Bevan said,

""At the state legislative level. Democrats not flip a single state and Republicans held off Democrats in Texas and Georgia and Alaska. They flipped state houses. You know, they held him up in Georgia. I think they put state house in New Hampshire. So, I mean, it was a it was a remarkable Republican. I mean, the irony of it is, is that Donald Trump, I think in many respects, sort of supercharged the Republican base and allowed Republicans to win seats in the House, hold their losses in the Senate, down one, at least as of right now. And yet he's going to be the one who may end up getting getting, you know, evicted from office because of it. We'll wait and see. Obviously, there's more to play out. But but it was a remarkable Republican night, and I think all the experts and prognosticators got it way, way wrong.""

On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, Trump 2020 Senior Legal Adviser Jenna Ellis explained why the Trump campaign is not asking to count all the votes in the states they are filing lawsuits, but to count the legal ballots in each state.

""It should be count every legal vote, because what the Democrats want is to count all of the ballots, the duplicative ballots, the delayed ballots. Remember when cats and dogs were receiving ballots, the dead people are receiving ballots. They want all of those ballots to count as well. So it's not about counting every vote. It's counting every legal vote. And in order to do that, we have to have transparency in the counting process. And we also have to make sure that the count is done fairly and accurately. And that's why we are filing the Trump campaign lawsuit to preserve election integrity and make sure that this country is still a country of free and fair elections.

""This is not just about going out and making all kinds of legal challenges because, this is about making sure that our process is done according to the law. And it's shocking that Democrats don't want the process to be followed, they're the party of manipulating the rules, of completely throwing out the rule book just to get the outcome they prefer. That's not what President Trump is all about. That's not what the campaign is all about. We are making sure that every legal vote counts and that's what elections are for, is leaving that up to the American people and every legal vote should count."""

On Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla, ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace discusses why he hopes for a definitive winner or loser in the 2020 Election and what it could mean for the future of election.

""There is no indication of any widespread fraud, any significant fraud. There always are irregularities in every election, particularly when you have 140 million votes cast. It'll be interesting to see, at some point in the next day or so, it's going to become clear who won. And the key at that point is whether or not they're going to be efforts to continue the lawyering. I don't know that it damages democracy. I think it is a sad chapter in the country. We need to count the vote. We need to see who won. Biden has a much clearer, easier path to 270 than than Trump does. But Trump still has one. And one would hope that the loser will call and concede to the winner and we'll move on.""

""One thing that would go a long way would be for the other person not to be filing lawsuits. I'm not taking sides here, whether it's Biden against Trump or Trump against Biden, but that the loser as what used to happen traditionally concedes and and we move on. There will be a lot of people who will never accept whoever the winner is. And that's just a sad fact of life in American politics in 2020."""

Kinzinger says if there is voter fraud there is a process for looking into that. Kinzinger is really concerned and upset about baseless claims by the president on Twitter that feeds conspiracy theories and undermines the election. On Joe Biden saying he wants to bring people together if he became president, Kinzinger says Biden has a reputation of being a dealmaker but the question is whether he or his handlers make the decisions. Kinzinger added, republicans holding onto the senate is the next best scenario if President Trump does not win because republicans will temper the far left in a Biden administration.

Plus, Kinzinger on winning reelection and how President Trump and republicans increased outreach to minorities has helped republicans retain and pick up seats in the House."

Shaw explained the decision saying,

""I mean, the Trump campaign is trying to win an election, and it's not surprising that, you know, they're pushing back hard because they correctly see Arizona as a very, very important state to the president's reelection. So we certainly get that. We do stand by the call. The current margin is 93000 votes. Our estimates are very much in line with what you're hearing from the Trump campaign and other independent observers that we think there's roughly 600000 votes outstanding. So you got to you got to make up, you know, 93000 votes with 600000 votes outstanding. The discrepancy is that at Fox, we were looking at the data and continue to look at the data and the vote flow in. Maricopa is on the order of 53 percent Biden, 47 percent Trump. So what the Trump campaign is saying is that they expect to win closer to, you know, 60 40. Share of the remaining outstanding vote and their particular argument is that, well, it's because these late, early voters, you know, people who cast their mail ballots on Monday or even on Tuesday. That they think that they're going to go decidedly for the president. Now, we don't have any evidence to suggest that's the case. You know, our news from our reports from the Fox News voter analysis suggests that, you know, in fact, you know, Biden has a slight edge in the mail in balloting. We looked at the preferences of people each day in our voter news analysis poll to see if the mail in people from Saturday to Sunday to Monday to Tuesday were distinct. That is, you know, the Trump claim campaign's claim is that the very late deciders doing the mail were disproportionately for Trump. We don't have evidence of that. And to be candid, the Trump campaign hasn't provided any evidence for that. They're simply saying we have reports on the ground that instead of, you know, 53 Biden, 47 Trump, it's going to come back 60 40 for the president."""

""I would expect the Trump administration is going to take down the hammer. I think you're going to see his lawyers come out, go to Pennsylvania, go to Wisconsin, go to Arizona and do a deep dive into these ballots. I can't imagine that Donald Trump, knowing the fighter that he has been all of these years, if he's going to walk away and say, OK, I trust you guys, the same guys who abused power in 2016 who now want to be in power once again.""

Peyton drew tens of thousands to his prayer crusades around the globe. Hollywood also, believe it or not, bowed to his calling.

It's certainly not bad for a poor, uneducated Irish immigrant who began life in America working as a janitor at a Cathedral in Pennsylvania. Fr. Peyton experienced his own miraculous healing from Tuberculosis, through the power of prayer to the Lady of the Rosary.
