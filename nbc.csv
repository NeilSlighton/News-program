Those concerns were exacerbated Monday when Trump blindsided officials throughout the White House and at the Pentagon by firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper with a tweet, multiple people close to the president said. The hope, these people said, is that this week ends differently from the last and that the president's lawsuits challenging the election results in multiple states quickly run their course.

The moment is particularly perilous, even for a White House that has powered through on chaos for nearly four years, with all the uncertainty unfolding against the backdrop of a new coronavirus outbreak among the president's closest advisers — including his chief of staff and the top lawyer on his campaign legal team.

""There needs to be a candid conversation with the president. There is no path to victory,"" said a person close to Trump, who said Trump ""deserves his day in court"" but added that continuing to cast doubt on the election results ""destroys his legacy.""

""It distracts from the legacy he has to be proud of and marginalizes him,"" this person said. ""It does not behoove him to drag this out much further.""

Another Trump ally described the goal of the lawsuits and public statements alleging voter fraud as ""branding Trump as something other than a loser.""

Most of those close to the president recognize that the legal battles aren't going to change the outcome, but few, if any, are telling him that.

Some officials' actions, allies said, made it clear how little confidence there is that Trump's legal strategy will prevail. Vice President Mike Pence, for example, is scheduled to leave Tuesday for vacation in Florida through the weekend.

""All you need to know is that Pence is going on vacation,"" a person close to Trump said when asked about the prospects for his legal fight.

Even before the election, Trump had doubts that he would win. According to a person familiar with the conversations, Trump told advisers in the weeks before Nov. 3 that he would consider a presidential run in 2024 if he lost. He's mentioned the idea again over the past week, and his allies have discussed his possibly setting up a super PAC.

And there are a divide and tensions within Trump's team over whether he should appear at so-called recount rallies his campaign has suggested it might hold.

Trump has told people he wants to thank and honor his supporters in some way, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But allies are concerned about the optics of and fallout from ""recount"" rallies when the electoral writing is very clearly on the wall.

There is also concern that Trump has not addressed the public since Thursday.

Trump's mood has vacillated in recent days between somewhat entertaining the idea that he has lost re-election to defiantly refusing to accept defeat, some of his allies say.

White House and Trump campaign officials, however, have begun to update their résumés.

""Everybody's worried about their post-presidency legacy,"" one Trump ally said.

Over the weekend, when Trump spent time at his golf club in Virginia, there were moments when he brought up the idea that he might lose and how he might proceed in the White House over the next nine weeks and then after he leaves office. But then Trump became more dug in on the notion of election fraud and at times was ranting about it to guests at his club.

""He's never, ever going to admit he didn't win,"" another ally said.

Trump is expected to make some decisions before leaving office — including potential executive orders and pardons and maneuvers to embed political appointees in government agencies as career civil servants — but as of now there is no overarching strategy to carry out those moves.

After Trump fired Esper, a person close to him said, ""I would not have advised it.""

Some around Trump initially backed his instinct to fight so they can establish themselves as being on his side before trying to bring him around. But now, dealing with him is like dealing with a ""recalcitrant teenager,"" a person close to the White House said.

Privately, they acknowledge the reality of the results. ""It began to sink in that this was over when foreign leaders — who are allied with the president — began congratulating Joe Biden,"" a person close to the White House said.

Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien and his deputy, Justin Clark, held an all-staff meeting at their Virginia headquarters Monday morning, urging aides to stay focused on ""the fight"" ahead, according to two officials who attended.

But the president's campaign is expected to officially end Sunday, with most staffers losing health insurance and their paychecks, unless either get extended in the next week. That is prompting some anxiety and concern, particularly among lower-level staffers, who are unsure whether they should be looking for new jobs right now. Several have started to contact potential employers."

Richard Pilger, who was director of the Election Crimes Branch of the DOJ, sent a memo to colleagues that suggested his resignation was linked to Barr’s memo, which was issued as the president’s legal team mount baseless legal challenges to the election results, alleging widespread voter fraud cost him the race.

“Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, and in accord with the best tradition of the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism (my most cherished Departmental recognition), I must regretfully resign from my role as Director of the Election Crimes Branch,” Pilger’s letter said, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.

“I have enjoyed very much working with you for over a decade to aggressively and diligently enforce federal criminal election law, policy, and practice without partisan fear or favor. I thank you for your support in that effort.”

Barr on Monday issued a memo authorizing prosecutors ""to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections.""

That's a change of Justice Department policy, which had previously advised prosecutors that ""overt investigative steps ordinarily should not be taken until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.""

Barr, who's come under fire by right-wing media for not bolstering the president's evidence-free claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, declared that guidance outdated.

""Such a passive and delayed enforcement approach can result in situations in which election misconduct cannot realistically be rectified,"" Barr said in the memo.

NBC News and several other major media outlets projected Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election on Saturday after several states spent days counting ballots following a record turnout, including mail-in and absentee voting. Trump has refused to concede to President-elect Biden and one of his appointees in the General Services Administration has yet to sign paperwork to begin the presidential transition.

Barr was not asked or directed by the president, any lawmaker, or anyone in the White House to issue this memo to federal prosecutors, according to a Department of Justice senior official. Barr, however, met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., earlier Monday. McConnell defended the president earlier Monday on the Senate floor, arguing he has a right to pursue recounts and lawsuits in court.

Barr did not respond to questions when he left McConnell’s office and a DOJ spokesperson has declined to comment on what the two men discussed.

A DOJ official told NBC News that the memo from Barr does not allege that there are substantial irregularities in the election. It authorizes local U.S. attorneys to investigate if they learn “clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.”

It added, ""While serious allegations should be handled with great care, specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries. Nothing here should be taken as an indication that the Department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election."""
7,2020-11-10 01:34:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-appointee-slow-walks-biden-transition-could-delay-president-elect-n1247152,Trump appointee slow-walks Biden transition. That could delay the president-elect's Covid-19 plan.,"The head of the General Services Administration has yet to recognize the incoming Biden administration — a delay that could have consequences for the president-elect's plan to move swiftly on the coronavirus.

More than 48 hours after media outlets projected that Joe Biden had defeated President Donald Trump to win the White House, GSA chief Emily Murphy had yet to sign the letter of ""ascertainment"" — a previously mostly noncontroversial process since the passage of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. Signing the paperwork when a new president is elected triggers the release of millions of dollars in transition funding and allows an incoming administration access to current government officials.

Murphy was appointed to the job by Trump in 2017.

With the ascertainment delayed, the Biden transition team has been prevented from meeting with officials heading Operation Warp Speed and other Trump administration coronavirus efforts.

""America's national security and economic interests depend on the federal government signaling clearly and swiftly that the United States government will respect the will of the American people and engage in a smooth and peaceful transfer of power,"" a Biden-Harris transition spokesperson said Monday in a statement.

The Biden transition official said Murphy's hold-up could also affect the Biden team's access to classified information for incoming national security officials; access to secure locations for private discussions about personnel, budget and policy issues; and access to the $6.3 million of congressionally appropriated funds designated for transition activities, office space and equipment.

Asked later Monday whether Biden's team might take legal action to force the GSA to recognize the transition, a Biden transition official said: ""Legal action is certainly a possibility. But there are other options, as well, that we are considering.""

Chris Lu, who led President Barack Obama's transition in 2008, said: ""Close cooperation between the outgoing and incoming administrations is always important, but it's especially critical when the country is facing a public health crisis and an economic recession.

""It's time for Donald Trump to put the national interest above his political interest,"" he added.

There has been little controversy around such paperwork after previous elections, and this marks the most significant delay since 2000, when the outcome of the election between George W. Bush and Al Gore hinged on a Supreme Court ruling during the Florida recount dispute.

The GSA did not indicate Monday when the paperwork would be signed. Trump has refused to concede the election, promised legal battles and said he would ask for a recount in Wisconsin. It appears as of now that no legal challenges have been filed that could overturn Biden's Electoral College victory.

""An ascertainment has not yet been made. GSA and its Administrator will continue to abide by, and fulfill, all requirements under the law and adhere to prior precedent established by the Clinton Administration in 2000,"" a GSA spokesperson said, pointing to the transition from President Bill Clinton to Bush.

Initially, the spokesperson said Sunday, the agency ""does not pick the winner in the presidential election,"" adding that the administrator ""ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution.""

""The administrator's ascertainment is done for the purposes of making additional services provided by the PTA (Presidential Transition Act) available,"" the spokesperson said.

""Until an ascertainment is made, the statute allows for the Biden Transition Team to continue to receive the pre-elect services from the government (e.g., office space, computers, background investigations for security clearances). GSA has met all statutory requirements under the PTA for this election cycle and will continue to do so.""

When the ascertainment was delayed by more than a month in 2000, Bush administration officials like Vice President Dick Cheney said such delay was dangerous for national security.

Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said a delay of a few days or a week is ""no great problem.""

""If it goes on longer, [it is] a potentially very big problem,"" he said, adding that it is most concerning as it relates to the pandemic and national security matters. ""This is a disturbing sign.""

Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service's Center for Presidential Transition said in a statement Sunday that it was time for the transition process to begin.

The statement was signed by veterans of Democratic and Republican administrations, including former Bush chief of staff Josh Bolten and former Bush administration Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt.

""While there will be legal disputes requiring adjudication, the outcome is sufficiently clear that the transition process must now begin,"" the statement said, adding, ""We urge the Trump administration to immediately begin the post-election transition process and the Biden team to take full advantage of the resources available under the Presidential Transition Act."""
8,2020-11-09 21:42:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-s-firing-esper-raises-concerns-about-national-security-during-n1247167,Trump's firing of Esper raises concerns about national security during Trump's final days in office,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's decision to abruptly fire his defense secretary underscores the national security concerns posed by what is shaping up to be the most volatile and uncertain presidential transition in modern American history, former officials and experts say.

The firing of Mark Esper is raising fears that Trump will fire other key national security officials over the next 10 weeks and use his enormous power in the military and intelligence realm to act rashly before he leaves office.

Speculation is rampant inside and outside the government about whether Trump will also remove FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA Director Gina Haspel, two experienced security hands who have displeased Trump by resisting some of his demands.

Even under the best of circumstances, a presidential transition ""is a period when we aren't necessarily firing on all cylinders in terms of the people and processes that manage national security issues for the nation, which creates that sense of heightened vulnerability,"" Nick Rasmussen, a former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, told NBC News.

""This particular move today creates concern and uncertainty because there are already concerns about the president's decision-making style and what he might do in the remaining days of his presidency,"" he said.

The stability of U.S. national security institutions ""is one of the mainstays of keeping America safe no matter what the threat, whether cyber, terrorism or nation-states such as Russia, China or Iran,"" Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress think tank, said. ""When you make sudden shifts the way that he does in firing personnel at a time of transition, it introduces even more uncertainty within the national security system.""

Former CIA Director John Brennan bluntly articulated the worries of many current and former officials who spoke to NBC News.

""I think there is a lot that's going to happen over the next 75 days as Trump carries out vendettas, settles scores and tries to position himself for his next act,"" he said. ""He is a totally unprincipled, unethical individual. I don't think anything is beyond him, and that's very scary to say.""

Americans should be ""apprehensive about what's going on,"" retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey said on MSNBC. ""We ought to be worried about this.""

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned Trump in a statement not to fire anyone else.

“I’m deeply troubled by President Trump’s firing of Defense Secretary Mark Esper just 72 days before a new president will be inaugurated and during a growing global pandemic,” he said. “The transfer of power should be peaceful and fulsome in accordance with the principles that have animated our republic since its founding and the last thing that our country needs is additional upheaval in the institutions designed to protect our national security. President Trump must not invite further volatility by removing any Senate-confirmed intelligence or national security officials during his time left in office.”

Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, spoke for many in his party when he said on Twitter, ""Trump is creating a dangerously unstable national security environment during this transition period. Adversaries are watching.""

Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called the Esper firing a destabilizing move that will only embolden our adversaries and put our country at greater risk.""

Even some Trump supporters expressed misgivings.

""Firing Esper is exactly the kind of chaos that cost Trump a second term,"" tweeted Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush who has called the Trump presidency ""among the best of my lifetime.""

""I have a grave sense of unease over the next 70 plus days,"" Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer, told NBC News. ""We face an enormity of overseas challenges, yet we have an angry, distracted and vindictive president who sees the intelligence community as his enemy, and thus will not be receptive to honest and direct intelligence briefings that provide the requisite warning function that keeps us safe. Does CIA Director Haspel even have any direct access to the president any longer? Must we count on the hopelessly politicized DNI Ratcliffe — a JV player on the national security scene if there ever was one — to be the only interface with the White House?""

Potential national security flashpoints, Polymeropoulos and other experts said, include rising violence in Afghanistan in the midst of peace negotiations and a debate over U.S. troop levels; continued Iranian support to Shia groups in Iraq that attack U.S. forces and diplomatic personnel; Chinese intimidation of Taiwan that could draw the U.S. into the conflict; and a rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe.

Domestically, officials remain concerned about potential post-election violence, particularly among right-wing extremists who believe Trump's false claims that the election as stolen from him.

There are also worries about whether the Trump administration will spill state secrets. In the days since it became clear former Vice President Joe Biden had won the election, there have been calls among Trump supporters for John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, to declassify more material related to the Russia investigation, despite qualms by some intelligence officials that doing so could compromise sources and methods.

""Will President Trump fire FBI Director Wray — and then selectively cherrypick and declassify top secret codeword intelligence that he believes muddies the water on the Russia investigation, putting sources and methods at grave risk?"" Polymeropoulos asked.

The U.S. government badly wants to avoid a situation in which ""our adversaries sense that vulnerability and weakness and have reason to question whether we can mount an effective response to whatever aggression or provocation they might throw our way,"" Rasmussen said.

""None of this guarantees that something terrible will happen over those 70-plus days,"" he added. ""It just introduces a new wild card and a new source of unpredictability exactly at the time when we should be seeking to lean on sources of stability and predictability. And that's what gives me concern.""

9,2020-11-09 21:09:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/we-are-stunned-two-georgia-races-will-decide-which-party-n1246962,'We are stunned': Two Georgia races will decide which party controls the Senate,"WASHINGTON — Georgia is about to become the center of the political universe.

Control of the Senate is likely to come down to the Jan. 5 Georgia runoff, when voters could be asked to decide whether both Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler should continue to serve in the upper chamber.

Loeffler will face a challenge from Democrat Raphael Warnock after the two emerged from the crowded jungle primary.

Perdue's race against Democrat Jon Ossoff is still rated ""too close to call"" by NBC News. The incumbent Republican remains short of the 50-percent threshold he needs to win the seat and avoid a runoff.

So far, Democrats have secured 48 seats in the Senate. And Republicans look poised to control 50 seats by the time all the votes are tallied in Alaska and North Carolina if the current leaders hold.

Democrats will need to win both of Georgia's seats to secure control of the chamber with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

The stakes are enormous. If Republicans hold one or both seats, Biden would be the first president since 1989 to enter office without full control of Congress, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would have power over his legislative agenda, cabinet picks and judicial nominees.

Georgia Democrats are celebrating the opportunity as Biden leads by 10,000 votes in the Republican-dominated state, with 99 percent counted and a potential recount on the horizon.

“It’s a new day in Georgia,” said Bianca Keaton, the chair of Gwinnett County Democratic Party in the diverse and growing Atlanta metropolitan area, which is powering Democrats. “I never thought we’d be in this position where the state of our country and the Senate would depend on our state. And here we are.”

Georgia has been on the forefront of the political evolution of the South.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Rev. Raphael Warnock.

Decades ago, Georgia Democrats ran the state. It was the era of ""Dixiecrats"" who fought to maintain racial segregation.

That began to flip when national Democrats embraced the civil rights movement and pro-segregationist politicians left the party. Georgia last voted Democrat for president in 1992 — when fellow Southerner Bill Clinton won — and Republicans haven't lost a Senate race there since 2000.

But in recent years, with booming suburbs and young, diverse voters skeptical of the GOP turn, a different kind of Democratic Party has been gaining a foothold. Hillary Clinton lost Georgia by just 5 points in 2016, and Stacey Abrams lost a gubernatorial election by 1.5 points in 2018.

“We are stunned,” said Jack Kingston, a former GOP congressman from Georgia and a Trump campaign surrogate. “You know it's out there but you just don't know how jarring it is till you see it. Hats off to the Democrats — they've gotten their people to the polls.”

Kingston said Perdue and Loeffler could try to leverage a Biden victory to their advantage by running against his proposed Cabinet appointees, especially if they’re from the “hard left” of the party.

“The idea that Americans like balance is helpful to us,” he said. “Our people do know how to vote in a runoff and we'll show back up.”

Republicans are preparing to campaign on keeping control of the Senate to restrain the progressive agenda. The party's campaign arm promoted footage of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., saying, ""Now we take Georgia, then we change America!""

Ossoff's campaign says it is prepared.

“That’s a conversation that we welcome,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster told reporters on a conference call Friday. “It is harder to protect Georgians’ rights unless we have a Democratic majority in the Senate.”

On Monday, Ossoff wrote a letter to Perdue calling for three live, in-person debates ahead of the possible runoff.

Democrats are planning to highlight their message about the need to tackle the coronavirus against a GOP they say has been reckless about the deadly pandemic and protect access to health care from attempts to unwind the Affordable Care Act.

Uncertainties surround the races. Which side will have the money edge? Will Republican energy flag without Trump on the ballot? Will the president’s baseless claims of election illegitimacy demotivate or fire up conservatives? Will the Atlanta metropolitan area drag Democrats over the line? And will the young and diverse new voters in Georgia turn out in big margins?

“Jon is particularly well positioned in this new electorate,"" Foster said, describing the race as the first runoff in the more diverse Georgia that has put Democrats in range.

Perdue’s campaign expressed confidence about the road ahead.

“If overtime is required when all of the votes have been counted, we're ready, and we will win,” Perdue campaign manager Ben Fry said in a statement, arguing that Georgians agree with “David Perdue's positive vision for the future direction of our country.”"
10,2020-11-09 23:05:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/georgia-s-republican-secretary-state-rejects-call-resignation-two-gop-n1247187,Georgia's Republican secretary of state rejects call for resignation by two GOP senators,"Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, sharply criticized two the state's two Republican senators on Monday after the lawmakers called on him to resign, citing his “failures,” without citing evidence, of his management of the election.

“The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” Raffensperger said in response to GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. “As Secretary of State, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts, and that illegal votes don’t count.”

Perdue and Loeffler, whose races are headed to a runoff in January, claimed in a statement that there was “mismanagement” in the election and a lack of transparency from Raffensperger regarding the process for counting ballots, echoing unfounded claims from President Donald Trump who has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden.

The state's 16 electoral votes have not allotted to either presidential candidate, but Biden is leading by a slim margin in the state with 99 percent of the expected vote in, according to NBC News. The state is headed for a statewide recount, but Raffensperger said a change in the outcome is ""unlikely.""

The Georgia Republicans will have rematches against Democrats two weeks before Biden’s inauguration as control of the Senate is likely to come down to the Jan. 5 runoff. Perdue is facing off against Jon Ossoff and Loeffler faces Rev. Raphael Warnock.

Raffensperger pressed the senators to reform voting laws, noting that federal, not state laws, are responsible for some issues in administering elections. He also suggested they should focus on their runoffs.

“Now that Senators Perdue and Loeffler are concerned about elections, hopefully, they can fix these federal laws,” he said. “As a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the U.S. Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on that.”

Raffensperger defended the work of his office, noting the historic turnout in the state — more than 5 million voters — and the legislation passed by the state’s Republican legislature that made absentee voting easier in this election. He also called their accusation that he has not been transparent “laughable,” noting the regular updates from his press office.

“If I was Senator Perdue, I’d be irritated I was in a runoff,” he said. “And both Senators and I are all unhappy with the potential outcome for our President.”

Raffensperger said he would investigate any voter fraud in the state but it is unlikely to change the outcome of the election.

“Was there illegal voting? I am sure there was. And my office is investigating all of it. Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is given Georgia’s electoral votes? That is unlikely,” he said."

""According to preliminary results, voters across the nation elected and re-elected Republican senators to a degree that actually stunned prognosticators. Likewise, the American people seem to have reacted to House Democrats' radicalism and obstruction by shrinking the speaker's majority and electing more Republicans,"" McConnell, R-Ky., who was re-elected last week, said on the Senate floor.

President-elect Joe Biden has captured almost 5 million more votes than Trump and was projected as the winner Saturday after Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes put him over the 270 needed to win. While numerous world leaders have congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, only a handful of Republicans have done so.

""Obviously, no states have yet certified their election results. We have at least one or two states that are already on track to a recount, and I believe the president may have legal challenges underway in at least five states,"" McConnell said before echoing a line used by other top Republicans in recent days.

""President Trump is 100 percent within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""Suffice it to say, a few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end of the republic.""

McConnell did not acknowledge Biden's win, instead saying the ""Constitution gives no role in this process to wealthy media corporations.""

He also chastised Democrats, saying, ""Let's not have any lectures, no lectures about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called claims of widespread voter fraud by Trump and his supporters ""dangerous"" and ""extremely poisonous.""

""As in any campaign, the president has a right to bring legal challenges or request recounts where state law allows. However, there is no legal right to file frivolous claims. Lawsuits must have basis in facts and evidence. And make no mistake, there has been no evidence of any significant or widespread voter fraud. Joe Biden won this election fair and square. The margins of his victory are growing by the day,"" Schumer said.

He acknowledged that there is ""no law or requirement"" that Trump ""concede or leave the office with grace,"" but he said history will ""surely note how this president and his Republican allies here in Congress treated our democracy on his way out the door."""

Governor's pitch to aid Trump appears to benefit her own campaign fund SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has enthusiastically taken up President Donald Trump's efforts to contest the results of the presidential election, asking for online donations to “help us bring it home for the president,” but it appears the donations are set to flow into her own reelection account. The Republican governor, a close Trump ally, launched a fundraising campaign soon after the election was called for Biden on Saturday. The website soliciting donations has “Kristi Noem for Governor” in large letters at the top, but below that, the message is all about Trump, saying that he “needs our support while the far-left Dems declare a victory for Biden before all the votes are counted.” It urges donors to ""Please help us bring it home for the president!” The site allows contributors to check the amount of their donation and includes a box to cover a processing “so 100% of my donation goes to Kristi for Governor.” Noem did not respond to a request for comment on how the money raised would be used. Her campaign committee chairman, Steve Kirby, said he had no comment on how the funds would be used. It's unlikely that much, if any, of the money will end up going to Trump, said Paul S.

Barr authorizes DOJ to investigate 'substantial allegations' of voting irregularities before election is certified Attorney General WIlliam Barr on Monday issued a memo authorizing prosecutors ""to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections."" That's a change of Justice Department policy, which had previously advised prosecutors that ""overt investigative steps ordinarily should not be taken until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded."" Barr, who's come under fire by right-wing media for not bolstering the president's evidence-free claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, declared that guidance outdated. ""Such a passive and delayed enforcement approach can result in situations in which election misconduct cannot realistically be rectified,"" he wrote. Barr met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier Monday. A senior DOJ official said neither Trump, nor anyone at the White House, nor any lawmakers asked or directed Barr to issue the memo. A DOJ official stressed that the memo from Barr does not allege that there are substantial irregularities in the election. It authorizes local U.S. attorneys to investigate if they learn “clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.” It adds that, ""While serious allegations should be handled with great care, specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries. Nothing here should be taken as any indication that the Department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election."" Share this -

Georgia's Republican secretary of state rejects call for resignation by two GOP senators Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, sharply criticized two the state's two Republican senators on Monday after the lawmakers called on him to resign, citing his “failures,” without citing evidence, of his management of the election. “The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,” Raffensperger said in response to GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. “As Secretary of State, I’ll continue to fight every day to ensure fair elections in Georgia, that every legal vote counts, and that illegal votes don’t count.” Perdue and Loeffler, whose races are headed to a runoff in January, claimed in a statement that there was “mismanagement” in the election and a lack of transparency from Raffensperger regarding the process for counting ballots, echoing unfounded claims from President Donald Trump who has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden. The state's 16 electoral votes have not allotted to either presidential candidate, but Biden is leading by a slim margin in the state with 99 percent of the expected vote in, according to NBC News. Raffensperger pressed the senators to reform voting laws, noting that federal, not state laws, are responsible for some issues in administering elections.

Governor's pitch to aid Trump appears to benefit her own campaign fund SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has enthusiastically taken up President Donald Trump's efforts to contest the results of the presidential election, asking for online donations to “help us bring it home for the president,” but it appears the donations are set to flow into her own reelection account. The Republican governor, a close Trump ally, launched a fundraising campaign soon after the election was called for Biden on Saturday. The website soliciting donations has “Kristi Noem for Governor” in large letters at the top, but below that, the message is all about Trump, saying that he “needs our support while the far-left Dems declare a victory for Biden before all the votes are counted.” It urges donors to ""Please help us bring it home for the president!” The site allows contributors to check the amount of their donation and includes a box to cover a processing “so 100% of my donation goes to Kristi for Governor.” Noem did not respond to a request for comment on how the money raised would be used. Her campaign committee chairman, Steve Kirby, said he had no comment on how the funds would be used. It's unlikely that much, if any, of the money will end up going to Trump, said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause, a campaign finance watchdog. Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer, pointed out that the governor can give a maximum of $2,800 to Trump’s campaign under federal law.

Trump aides fret about damage from refusal to accept loss WASHINGTON — As President Trump continues to fight the presidential election results, numerous people close to him are expressing concern that he’s spiraling into rage and hurting his own legacy as well as the Republican Party. Those concerns were exacerbated on Monday when Trump blindsided officials throughout the White House and at the Pentagon by firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper with a tweet, multiple people close to the president said. The hope, these people said, is that this week ends differently than the last, and that the president’s lawsuits challenging the election results in multiple states quickly run their course. The moment is particularly perilous, even for a White House that’s powered through on chaos for nearly four years, with all the uncertainty unfolding against the backdrop of a new coronavirus outbreak among the president’s closest advisers — including his chief of staff and top lawyer on his campaign legal team. “There needs to be a candid conversation with the president. There is no path to victory,” said one person close to Trump, who said the president “deserves his day in court” but added that continuing to cast doubt on the election results “destroys his legacy.” Another Trump ally described the goal of the lawsuits and public statements alleging voter fraud as aimed at “branding Trump as something other than a loser.” Most of those close to the president recognize these legal battles aren’t going to change the outcome, but few, if any, are telling him that.

Native American man celebrating Biden’s election with a traditional dance goes viral A video showing a Navajo and Tewa man celebrating President-elect Joe Biden’s victory with a traditional dance in Albuquerque, New Mexico, garnered 5 million views after it was posted to Twitter on Saturday by photojournalism student Sharon Chischilly. A Native American dances in the street along with other individuals in Albuquerque NM pic.twitter.com/LeN7m9Ig89 — Sharon Chischilly (@Schischillyy) November 8, 2020 Chischilly, who is of Navajo descent, said she was filming protests in Albuquerque when she overheard familiar music. She then spotted a man performing a traditional storytelling dance. “It grabbed my attention and I ran over with my phone,” she told NBC News in an interview. “I was trying to record him while taking photographs of the dancing.” Chischilly said she was thrilled to see Native American heritage on display, but was disappointed she didn’t know who the dancer was. After posting the video on her Twitter account, she was able to connect with the dancer, Ashkia Randy Trujillo from Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico, when he commented on her post. “I was just dancing because I was happy that, you know, we're gonna be seeing ... different leadership. You know, something different from what we've seen these past four years,” Trujillo, 26, told NBC News. Trujillo said he was doing one of the many powwow styles of dance, which often tell the story of a successful hunt or a victorious battle. Although they do not completely share the same tribal heritage, Chischilly said the music reminded her of the Navajo traditions and growing up in Manuelito, in the Navajo reservation that encompasses part of the state. “It did bring back a little bit of like, normal, you know, and it definitely made me feel like I was at home,” she said. Just fyi I am new to Twitter and I didnt plan on ever having one but wasnt quite sure how to get a hold of @Schischillyy to give her thanks and props for capturing this moment. Words can not express how happy I am. I hope you feel the love everyone!

The moment is particularly perilous, even for a White House that’s powered through on chaos for nearly four years, with all the uncertainty unfolding against the backdrop of a new coronavirus outbreak among the president’s closest advisers — including his chief of staff and top lawyer on his campaign legal team. “There needs to be a candid conversation with the president. There is no path to victory,” said one person close to Trump, who said the president “deserves his day in court” but added that continuing to cast doubt on the election results “destroys his legacy.” Another Trump ally described the goal of the lawsuits and public statements alleging voter fraud as aimed at “branding Trump as something other than a loser.” Most of those close to the president recognize these legal battles aren’t going to change the outcome, but few, if any, are telling him that.

Native American man celebrating Biden’s election with a traditional dance goes viral A video showing a Navajo and Tewa man celebrating President-elect Joe Biden’s victory with a traditional dance in Albuquerque, New Mexico, garnered 5 million views after it was posted to Twitter on Saturday by photojournalism student Sharon Chischilly. A Native American dances in the street along with other individuals in Albuquerque NM pic.twitter.com/LeN7m9Ig89 — Sharon Chischilly (@Schischillyy) November 8, 2020 Chischilly, who is of Navajo descent, said she was filming protests in Albuquerque when she overheard familiar music. She then spotted a man performing a traditional storytelling dance. “It grabbed my attention and I ran over with my phone,” she told NBC News in an interview. “I was trying to record him while taking photographs of the dancing.” Chischilly said she was thrilled to see Native American heritage on display, but was disappointed she didn’t know who the dancer was. After posting the video on her Twitter account, she was able to connect with the dancer, Ashkia Randy Trujillo from Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico, when he commented on her post. “I was just dancing because I was happy that, you know, we're gonna be seeing ... different leadership. You know, something different from what we've seen these past four years,” Trujillo, 26, told NBC News. Trujillo said he was doing one of the many powwow styles of dance, which often tell the story of a successful hunt or a victorious battle. Although they do not completely share the same tribal heritage, Chischilly said the music reminded her of the Navajo traditions and growing up in Manuelito, in the Navajo reservation that encompasses part of the state. “It did bring back a little bit of like, normal, you know, and it definitely made me feel like I was at home,” she said. Just fyi I am new to Twitter and I didnt plan on ever having one but wasnt quite sure how to get a hold of @Schischillyy to give her thanks and props for capturing this moment. Words can not express how happy I am. I hope you feel the love everyone!

Biden, in his first public remarks since his Saturday night victory speech, also tied mask-wearing, which can stem the spread of Covid-19, to his campaign message of unity.

“It doesn't matter who you voted for, where you stood before Election Day. It doesn't matter your party, your point of view, we can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democrat or Republican lives, American lives,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware.

“Please, I implore you, wear a mask,” he added. “A mask is not a political statement, but it is a way to start pulling the country together.”

“The goal of mask-wearing is not to make you less comfortable, or take something away from you. It's to give something back to all of us, a normal life,” Biden said. “The goal is to get back to normal as fast as possible. Masks are critical in doing that. It won't be forever, but that's how we'll get our nation back.”

Biden ran on promises to unite the country and to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which had, as of Monday afternoon, killed nearly 240,000 people in the U.S.

Biden’s remarks — which came two days he was projected to win the presidency — demonstrate he is marking the kick-off of his presidential transition with the fight against Covid-19. Earlier Monday, he announced his Covid-19 task force, led by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University professor Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith.

Confirmed coronavirus cases are on the rise again in many parts of the U.S. — a fact that Biden referred to as proof that “the worst wave yet in this pandemic” was underway and that the country was facing a “very dark winter.”

Biden, during his remarks Monday, also reiterated his calls for any approved vaccines to be distributed “equitably and efficiently and free for every American” and for the ramping up of production of more personal protective equipment for health care and other front-line workers.

Earlier Monday, the drug company Pfizer announced that an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate for Covid-19 was more than 90 percent effective at preventing infection. Biden called the development ""positive"" but cautioned that the reviews and approvals now needed to bring the vaccine to market must be ""grounded in science and fully transparent so the American people can have every confidence that any approved vaccine is safe and effective."""
17,2020-11-09 15:32:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/early-look-who-might-be-biden-s-inner-circle-white-n1246794,An early look at who might be in Biden's inner circle in the White House,"WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joe Biden is focused on building the team that will enter the White House with him on Inauguration Day, his “Day One staff,” as he looks to fill several thousand jobs in his administration, according to multiple people familiar with the process.

Biden plans to announce these positions likely later this week. Longtime Biden adviser Ron Klain is among those leading the effort to fill these roughly 200 positions in the White House and at some key government agencies, these people said. Once that’s complete, they said Biden will turn to building out his Cabinet.

The contenders for these “Day One” jobs range from Biden loyalists — some who have worked for him since his first run for office 50 years ago — to a group of relatively new aides who joined his 2020 campaign. Here’s an initial look at some of those expected to play big roles.

Ron Klain: A former chief of staff to Biden during his first years as vice president, Klain also coordinated the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, giving him both familiarity with Biden and important credentials as the Covid-19 response will consume Biden’s opening months. Biden insiders expect him to serve as White House chief of staff.

Kate Bedingfield: The Democratic communications operative joined Biden’s vice presidential office in 2015 as he closed in on a final decision on the 2016 presidential race, quickly earning his trust. As deputy campaign manager and communications director, she is expected to serve in a similar role in the West Wing.

Jake Sullivan: A former national security adviser to Biden as vice president, Sullivan has also played a lead role in the campaign by crafting his domestic policy agenda alongside Stef Feldman, another veteran of the Biden vice presidential office. Sullivan is said to prefer a domestic policy role, perhaps on the Domestic Policy Council.

Tony Blinken: A former deputy secretary of state and longtime Biden foreign policy adviser, he is a favorite to serve either as national security adviser or potentially secretary of state as the Biden team weighs the makeup of Cabinet posts.

Bruce Reed: Another former Biden chief of staff, he has been one of the members of the inner circle who has spent the most time with the president-elect on the campaign trail and would likely be a versatile policy adviser in the West Wing.

Cedric Richmond: The young Louisiana congressman was a day-one co-chairman of Biden’s campaign, a key bridge to Democrats in Congress and a prominent national surrogate. With his relationships on Capitol Hill and loyalty to Biden through early, difficult moments of the Democratic primary campaign — especially on flashpoints on race — he’s likely to be in the conversation for a top West Wing perch or Cabinet position, if he does not look to move up the ranks on Capitol Hill.

Symone Sanders: Her fierce public advocacy for Biden and nose-to-the-grindstone work ethic behind the scenes quickly earned the trust of Biden’s tight inner circle. Sanders wrote in her memoir that she one day wanted to be White House press secretary, and if that becomes reality, she would be the youngest and first Black woman ever in the post.

Steve Ricchetti: Another former Biden vice presidential chief of staff, the Ohioan played an important but largely under-the-radar role for Biden's presidential campaign in maintaining relationships with Democratic stakeholders and donors. Ricchetti would likely continue that formally or informally in Biden’s White House.

Yohannes Abraham and Jeff Zients: As the day-to-day taskmaskers of Biden’s transition team for months, the duo could transition themselves into top West Wing or administration perches. Abraham served all eight years in the Obama White House, ultimately as chief of staff for the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs. Zients served as acting director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama and director of the National Economic Council.

Players without titles: Mike Donilon, the campaign’s chief strategist, may not take a formal West Wing post but will always be a sounding board for Biden — a role he’s played for decades. The president-elect’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, will always have his ultimate trust. And former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, helming Biden’s transition team, will also continue to offer counsel."

Mexico has yet to congratulate Joe Biden on his win.,"The country that shares the U.S. southern border is one of the few that has not recognized that Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States.

Latino lawmakers noticed.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro, a Democratic House member from Texas, and several other Latino lawmakers lashed out at Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador for not acknowledging Joe Biden as president-elect.

López Obrador said Saturday that he would refrain from commenting on the U.S. elections until ""all the legal matters have been resolved.""

""This represents a stunning diplomatic failure by Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador at a time when the incoming Biden Administration is looking to usher in a new era of friendship and cooperation with Mexico,"" Castro tweeted Saturday in English and Spanish.

Castro, who is Mexican American, heads the House Foreign Affairs oversight subcommittee and has said he wants to head the full committee.

President Donald Trump is challenging the election results in several states. Election officials have said they have no evidence of fraud, pointing to the presence of representatives of both parties during the vote counts and the transparency of the process. Experts say Trump's efforts are unlikely to change the election results.

At least half a dozen other Democratic lawmakers joined Castro's criticism of López Obrador. Rep. Chuy García, D-Ill., who was born in Mexico, tweeted in Spanish, ""Don't let the train pass you by."" Most world leaders have recognized Biden's win.

President @lopezobrador_ , American voters have spoken and Joe Biden is our President Elect. He won fair and square. No deje que se le vaya el tren. https://t.co/JjihI0pgWd — Congressman Chuy García (@RepChuyGarcia) November 8, 2020

Arizona Democratic state Sen. Martín Quezada said, ""This is beyond disappointing.""

Because of mutual interests, the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico will be fine, said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, but he said López Obrador's delay in congratulating Biden is not helpful.

""It's a mistake on his part that will affect the tenor of the relations at the beginning to some extent,"" Shifter said.

López Obrador, who took office in late 2018, has dealt with tough demands from Trump to stem illegal migration through Central America to the Mexican-U.S. border. Doing so kept tough tariffs on Mexico's products from going into effect.

The U.S., Mexico and Canada ratified the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, helped in part by the Trump-López-Obrador relationship. Mexico avoided deep oil production cuts demanded by OPEC with some intervention by Trump.

López Obrador began his presidency promising a more humane approach to migrants. But he ended up using Mexico soldiers, National Guard forces and police to stem the flow of migrants, and he gave in to Trump's demands to have migrants wait for their U.S. asylum court dates in Mexico under the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told the Mexican newspaper Reforma that the government has been in contact with Biden's and Trump's teams and would remain in contact during the coming days.

""Whether it's keeping the [relationship] with Trump or establishing it with Biden, who has known President López Obrador since 2012, the objective will be to have the best possible relationship,"" Ebrard told Reforma.

Some said Biden offers a fresh take on U.S.-Mexican relations after Trump kicked off his 2016 campaign calling Mexican immigrants rapists, murderers and people bringing drugs into the country and pledged to build a wall along the entire Mexico border, which he would make Mexico pay for.

He said that Mexico's ties to the U.S. are strategic and that López Obrador has demonstrated how seriously he takes the relationship.

López Obrador's hesitation to acknowledge Biden as the president-elect stands in contrast to the reactions of most leaders in the region, except for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is sometimes referred to as ""the Trump of the Tropics.""

Not all leaders congratulated Biden. Cuba acknowledged that the U.S. has a new president but did not mention Biden's name or congratulate him.

After four years of no first pet at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. — the longest such stretch in well over a century — Biden and his wife will move in with a pair of German shepherds, Champ and Major.

""I've had German shepherds since I was a kid and I've actually trained them and shown them in the past,"" Biden told ABC back in 2008.

The Bidens got Champ as a puppy in 2008, shortly before they moved into the vice president's official residence at the Naval Observatory. The name had emotional significance for the then-vice president-elect — his father would tell him ""Get up, champ"" when he was feeling down.

Joe Biden adopted a German shepherd named Major from the Delaware Humane Association in 2018. Delaware Humane Society

Biden used the pooch to raise kids' spirits while he was VP — he was known to give out little ""Champ"" plush pets to kids during his time in office.

Major will be the first shelter dog to enjoy life in the White House.

Biden had been on the lookout for a pal for the aging Champ when he heard about some German shepherd puppies that had been taken in from the Delaware Humane Society in 2018.

""Major was 1 of 6 puppies who were brought to DHA after coming in contact with something toxic in their home. Their original owner was unable to afford veterinary care so they surrendered them,"" the group wrote on its Facebook page at the time. ""Joe Biden caught wind of them and reached out immediately. The rest is history!""

Biden hasn't spoken publicly about Major's name, but the president-elect's late son, Beau Biden, was a major in the Delaware National Guard. He won't be the first Major to live in the White House — Franklin Roosevelt also had a German shepherd named Major.

While Sen. Elizabeth Warren used her golden retriever Bailey as a popular surrogate on the campaign trail during the Democratic primaries, Champ and Major have stayed on the sidelines — at least physically. Both popped up in ads during the presidential campaign, urging voters to put dogs back in the White House.

Trump had been the first president to forgo an animal companion in the White House since Andrew Johnson in the 1860s, according to the Presidential Pet Museum. He said in 2019 he'd ""feel a little phony"" walking a dog on the White House lawn.

While dogs have been the most popular White House pets, past presidents haven't kept just canines. John F. Kennedy had ponies, Calvin Coolidge had a bobcat, Teddy Roosevelt had a one-legged rooster, and Thomas Jefferson kept a pair of grizzly bear cubs on the White House lawn."
20,2020-11-09 21:32:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/lawyers-can-t-find-parents-666-migrant-kids-higher-number-n1247144,"Lawyers can't find the parents of 666 migrant kids, a higher number than previously reported","WASHINGTON — Lawyers working to reunite migrant families separated by the Trump administration before and during its ""zero tolerance"" policy at the border now believe the number of separated children for whom they have not been able to find parents is 666, higher than they told a federal judge last month, according to an email obtained by NBC News.

Nearly 20 percent, or 129, of those children were under 5 at the time of the separation, according to a source familiar with the data.

In the email, Steven Herzog, the attorney leading efforts to reunite the families, explains that the number is higher because the new group includes those ""for whom the government did not provide any phone number."" Previously, the lawyers said they could not find the parents of 545 children after they had tried to make contact but had been unsuccessful.

Herzog said in the email to Justice Department attorneys representing the Trump administration, ""we would appreciate the government providing any available updated contact information, or other information that may be helpful in establishing contact for all 666 of these parents.""

Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, explained to NBC News that the new number ""includes individuals in addition to 545 for whom we got no information from government that would allow meaningful searches but are hopeful the government will now provide with that information.""

The Trump administration imposed a ""zero tolerance"" policy on the U.S./Mexico border between April and June 2018 under which undocumented migrant parents and children were separated. Prior to the borderwide ""zero tolerance"" policy, the Trump administration tested family separation in a pilot program in the El Paso sector. The vast majority of the children referenced in the email obtained by NBC News were separated during this pilot program, but the total also includes some children who were separated under zero tolerance.

President-elect Joe Biden has committed to establishing a government task force that would work to reunite all migrant families separated by Trump administration policies. But, according to two sources familiar with the incoming administration's planning on immigration, Biden has so far not decided whether separated parents will be given the opportunity to come to the U.S. to reunite with their children and pursue claims to asylum.

Herzog, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

It was ultimately signed into law last year by Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, but was then was successfully challenged by Coloradans Vote, a group that gathered enough signatures to invoke a rarely used referendum to ask Colorado voters to confirm or repeal the law.

John Koza was part of that early effort and was the creator and chair of the National Popular Vote nonprofit. He is a computer scientist who is known for his work in genetics and even co-invented the scratch-off lottery ticket and has had more than a passing interest in how the U.S. presidential election operates.

“I've been interested in the quirks of the Electoral College since the ’60s,” Koza said.“Several of us got together and said maybe a state-based approach, which is what we have, would be a better way to try to get a national popular vote. So that's how the national popular vote got started.”

While the compact has gained traction in states run by Democratic governors, it has been supported by some Republicans such as former RNC chair Michael Steele.

Critics, however, say the popular vote initiative will encourage candidates to focus on large cities, which tend to favor Democratic candidates. Koza takes issue with that.

“We know how candidates campaign now, and they would campaign the same way they do now, except it would be spread out over the whole country,” he said.

That sentiment is echoed by Sylvia Bernstein, the coalition coordinator for the Yes on National Popular Vote campaign.

“It shouldn't be a partisan issue,” Bernstein said. “The reason why people should support the national popular vote is pretty simple. … The candidate with the most votes should win, just the way it happens in every other election in this country.”

She said candidates should be forced to campaign across the entire country, not just in a handful of swing states.

“Right now, we see both candidates hunkered down in Pennsylvania. You know, Pennsylvania has nothing to do with Colorado, or California, or Texas.”

Other opponents say states would cede power under the compact.

“The feedback that I was receiving from my constituents was, what can we do about this? Why don't we get to vote on the national popular vote?” said Don Wilson, a Republican, a co-founder of Coloradans Vote and the mayor of Monument, Colorado.

“I would agree that if it's not a partisan issue, I would say that it tears away from our state sovereignty, or your state to be an independent voice,” Wilson said.

“The presidential election is the only election we have where state sovereignty and the state's population is combined for one voice.”

Both Koza and Wilson already have their sights set on what happens after Colorado. Wilson said he would want to discuss the issue with other states before it shows up in their legislatures.

Koza is looking to Virginia, which passed the compact in its House of Delegates, then was punted by committee to be taken up by the state Senate after the election.

One thing all parties agree on is the likelihood of a legal challenge after the campaign reaches the required number of electoral votes. Proponents are confident that the courts will ultimately allow states to decide how to carry out presidential elections.

“It's hard to imagine that something that's important wouldn't get challenged in court,” Bernstein said.

“We feel very confident that we would survive those challenges. The Constitution is very clear that state legislators have the exclusive and plenary right to award the state's electors however they so choose. And so that's exactly what this compact does.”"

The Democratic Party has big plans — from defeating the coronavirus to expanding health care access to tackling climate change to expanding voting rights to overhauling criminal justice.

There will be tension between progressives who want to pursue an aggressive agenda and moderates who want to strike a note of unity and seek cooperation with Republicans after a bruising election.

As he begins to roll out his transition plans, Biden can expect to feel the heat from the left wing of his party quickly.

""There's not going to be a honeymoon because there was no wedding,"" Ezra Levin, the co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said. ""This is a partnership. It's a partnership to save democracy. Nobody is under any illusions that the reforms we want to see are just automatically going to happen.""

""The reason there can be no honeymoon period is, we don't have much time,"" he added. ""We've got to hit the ground running.""

Biden campaigned on bringing the country together and pursuing an ambitious progressive agenda.

He will face major hurdles:

Unless Democrats flip two outstanding seats in Georgia, Republicans will control the Senate and have a veto on his legislative agenda, Cabinet picks and judicial nominees;

Democrats have a shrunken House minority that will limit their runway;

The new 6-3 majority conservative Supreme Court could restrain the executive actions Biden may pursue without Congress.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., the most moderate Democrat in the chamber, called on his colleagues to put partisanship aside and ""pursue bipartisan solutions"" to America’s problems.

""Now, more than ever,"" he said, ""it is time for us to come together to end the toxic political tribalism and invest in the values and principles that make our nation the greatest country on Earth.""

But liberals will insist on the opposite.

""I know Joe Biden likes to consider himself a dealmaker but this is not the 1970s anymore,"" said Waleed Shahid of the activist group Justice Democrats, which is allied with progressive lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. ""Any sort of toxic deals with Mitch McConnell will likely demobilize the Democratic electorate.""

Shahid said progressives will push Biden to use his executive authority to advance ""major parts of his agenda, particularly the climate crisis.""

Georgia's Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are bracing for runoffs Jan. 5 against Democratic opponents Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively. Unless both GOP incumbents are defeated, the chamber will be run by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

If so, Biden will be the first president since 1989 to take office without full control of Congress.

""This is uncharted waters for two polarized parties in the modern era,"" Shahid said.

Either way, the left of the party intends to keep the heat on.

""We're going to introduce 'Medicare For All' — believe me, we are,"" Sanders said a conversation with the so-called squad days before the election. ""Green New Deal — we ain't giving up on that.""

Ocasio-Cortez, on the same call, praised Sanders for challenging the Democratic Party apparatus to be bolder and said their collective efforts will ""prevent the rightward drift of the Democratic Party.""

Senior Democratic aides said they're waiting to see whether McConnell will take a defiant or conciliatory posture in the wake of Biden's victory.

""Senate Democrats will be on two tracks,"" one Democratic aide said. ""First, to accomplish the policy changes we believe the nation needs, we are going to have to work furiously to win Georgia. Second, we need to get a sense of McConnell's posture. Does McConnell want to deal or slide back in Obama-era obstruction?"""

Now what?,"When Joe Biden clinched the presidency Saturday, climate activists breathed a sigh of relief.

After four years of President Donald Trump's denying the science of climate change and dismantling or rolling back more than 100 environmental protections, climate experts knew the stakes in the election could not have been higher.

""The climate movement was very clear-eyed about just how crucial this election was, so I think that made anxiety run pretty darn high,"" said Katharine Wilkinson, editor-in-chief of Project Drawdown, a coalition of researchers and scientists who are working on climate change solutions. ""Science tells us we don't have time for another four years of a Trump administration. We don't have time for four more years of bailing out failing fossil fuel companies and four more years of moving backwards.""

Wilkinson, a co-founder of the All We Can Save project, a women-led climate nonprofit, said the past few days have been ""definitely a roller coaster."" Now, experts say they are eager for the new president to get to work on tackling the climate crisis.

But if Republicans keep control of the Senate, there may be challenges as Biden tries to turn his plans into action. Most climate activists have applauded Biden's climate plan, which includes investing $2 trillion over four years and aims to achieve a 100 percent clean electricity standard by 2035.

Democrats gained a Senate seat but need to pick up two more to reach 50 and assume control, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaking vote. Two Senate seats in Georgia, now held by Republicans, appear to be advancing to runoff elections on Jan. 5, which means the makeup of the Senate could hang in the balance until then.

Still, Biden can make progress on climate issues even if the Senate majority remains in Republican hands, said Shiv Someshwar, a visiting professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.

It is unlikely that sweeping legislation along the lines of the Green New Deal could move forward without a Democratic-controlled Senate, but a Biden administration can still address some short- and long-term impacts of climate change, he said.

""While massive investments may not be possible, the Biden administration could be active in rolling out regulations that are designed to limit [greenhouse gas] emission and those that minimize climate risk in future on public and private assets,"" said Someshwar, who is European chair for sustainable development and climate transition at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) in France.

That could include supporting the national adoption of fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks like those that have been introduced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Someshwar added.

Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that if the public demands action on climate, sluggish lawmakers may be forced to take note.

""Even if the U.S. Senate doesn't lead on strong climate policy, they can be dragged along, and we can expect to see progress regardless of who is controlling the Senate,"" she said Thursday, two days after the election, at a news conference with several prominent environmental organizations.

McCarthy, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, said fighting climate change ""isn't just about protecting polar bears in faraway places — it's essentially about protecting people, our families, right here and right now.""

Climate experts are also eager for Biden to repair the United States' reputation internationally. The day after the election, the U.S. formally exited the Paris Agreement, a global pact among more than 185 countries to curb emissions and keep the rise in average temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius. Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the landmark climate accord in 2017, and the process was initiated a year ago.

Biden has said he intends to rejoin the Paris Agreement, but the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up to meet the goals of the accord. And it is becoming increasingly clear that deeper cuts to emissions will be necessary to limit global warming to below 3.6 degrees F, said Michael Mann, a climatologist and professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University.

""The sobering reality is that even if every country meets their commitment under Paris (and many, including the U.S. and E.U. are currently falling short), that gets us less than halfway to where we need to be,"" he said in an email. ""Paris is a good starting point, but we need to go well beyond Paris now to achieve the reductions that are necessary.""

Mann acknowledged, however, that Biden's victory favors ""an atmosphere of global cooperation.""

And Wilkinson said that while plenty of challenges lie ahead, it was heartening to see climate politics play such an important role this election cycle.

NBC News exit polls of early and Election Day voters indicated that two-thirds of voters said they believe climate change is a serious problem. The same polls showed that Biden won about 7 in 10 voters who see climate change as a serious problem.

""There are lots of climate silver linings in this election,"" she said. ""Of course, the big question mark is what the makeup of the Senate looks like, and will we have the full suite of levers for bold climate action in 2021, but I'm cautiously hopeful."""

Susan Collins of Maine on Monday joined a handful of prominent Republicans in congratulating President-elect Joe Biden for his projected presidential win, breaking with the vast majority of GOP lawmakers.

Collins said Biden ""loves this country,"" and wished him success on ""his apparent victory.""

My statement on the 2020 Presidential election results: pic.twitter.com/8NY1WpaJpC — Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) November 9, 2020

Collins, who won re-election after a difficult campaign, is among the few elected Republicans to congratulate Biden publicly, joining Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska in referring to him as the president-elect. The overwhelming majority of congressional Republicans have yet to extend their congratulations to Biden, who was a U.S. senator for decades before serving as vice president under then-President Barack Obama.

In her statement, Collins referenced the importance of the presidential transition and emphasized that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris ""should be given every opportunity"" to be ready to govern once they are sworn into office.

Collins also acknowledged President Donald Trump's questioning of the election outcome, saying he ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge any results. She did not vote for Trump in 2016, writing in another Republican, but would not say during her re-election campaign whether she had voted for the president this time.

Trump has refused to concede the election, vowing legal fights over the results and making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. On Saturday, he responded to Biden's projected victory by claiming the election is ""far from over.""

Other Senate Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, have adamantly supported Trump's pursuit of recounting ""legal"" votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, also said Monday that Trump is ""within his rights"" to look into election ""irregularities.""

In rejecting the results of the election, Trump has guided the Republican Party in doubting Biden's win, though some Republicans have begun to distance themselves from that stance.

Thirty former Republican members of Congress released an open letter Monday urging the president to accept the election results. The group included many who endorsed Biden and some who supported Trump's impeachment in January.

The group said Trump's statements alleging election fraud are ""unacceptable"" and aimed ""to undermine the legitimacy of the election.""

Like other Republicans, Collins urged voters to be patient.

""I know that many are eager to have certainty right now,"" Collins said. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process. I urge people to be patient.""

""The process has not failed our country in more than 200 years, and it is not going to fail our country this year,"" she added.

Former President George W. Bush, the only living ex-GOP president, on Sunday congratulated Biden on the projected win, referring to him as ""President-elect."" In his statement, Bush noted that Trump has a right to challenge the results, but seemed to suggest that the fight would not be successful.

""The American people can have confidence that this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear,"" Bush said."

In the middle of a surging pandemic, to call the next three months of our government a ""lame duck"" period is a fatal mistake. The consequences of the decisions made between now and Jan. 20 — in infections, hospitalizations and deaths — will shape our nation for years to come. A peaceful, seamless, effective and urgent transition, specifically focused on stopping the spread of Covid-19, could save tens of thousands of lives. As Barack Obama said following his election as president during the financial crisis of 2008, ""We don't have a minute to waste.""

In the middle of a surging pandemic, to call the next three months of our government a ""lame duck"" period is a fatal mistake.

President-elect Joe Biden has defeated President Donald Trump amid the multiple crises of economic collapse and civil unrest, shaped and augmented by the greatest public health crisis in a century. And unfortunately, our nation is now approaching the most dangerous period of this pandemic. More than 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the infection every day, and because of inadequate testing, we are likely to be missing a majority of new cases.

According to my calculations and the COVID Tracking Project, the number of coronavirus hospitalizations has increased dramatically since Labor Day, and more than 1,000 people in the U.S. are losing their lives every single day to this virus. More concerning — we are not on a pathway out of the crisis. This past week was one of the worst weeks of the pandemic. This week will likely be worse. Next week will be worse yet.

Given where things stand, we do not have the luxury of waiting until January to act. We must model this transition on the handoff from President George W. Bush to Obama in the midst of the 2008 recession. During that time, Bush prioritized national interests over partisan scorekeeping, proactively reaching out to the Obama team to establish a council to coordinate his administration's handoff and speed the nominations of key officials in the next administration.

The Bush and Obama teams collaborated closely on the colossal Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP — a $700 billion stimulus package to halt the cascading collapse of the economy. While it was politically controversial, it would have been easy for Bush to leave such difficult political choices to his successor. He did not. He knew that the nation needed prompt, effective and coordinated action. ""I told the American people, and I told the president-elect when I first met him, that any time we were to make a big decision during this transition, he will be informed, as will his team,"" Bush said Nov. 24, 2008.

Obama seized the opportunity to hit the ground running, saying, ""Our families can't afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution."" Two days after his election, he convened an economic advisory board to meet at the White House to work with the Bush administration to manage the financial crisis. Obviously, there were important areas of disagreement between the Obama and Bush teams, but both sides kept the greater goal of the national welfare in view. Days before Obama's inauguration, Bush called on Congress to release the second round of $350 billion of TARP funds — at Obama's request.

This transition is different, of course. But the American people, whether they voted for Biden or Trump, should demand that both sides find a way to move forward together.

This transition is different, of course. But the American people, whether they voted for Biden or Trump, should demand that both sides find a way to move forward together.

So what would such a united approach look like over the next three months, in the teeth of an even more lethal crisis? Let's start with three main areas.

The Trump administration, which has been less than forthcoming with crucial data about the pandemic over the past nine months, should immediately give the Biden team access to the full range of data collected by federal agencies to allow the incoming administration to formulate effective, evidence-based policies based on the best data. Biden has already announced the members of his Covid-19 task force, including a variety of widely respected experts.

Like Bush, Trump must give equal time to Biden to communicate with the American public about the pandemic and our national response. In particular, Trump should allow career scientists in the federal government and scientists advising the Biden team to take the lead in communications around infections and the public health measures needed to prevent them.

Finally, the Trump administration must recognize the limits of its tenure and collaborate and compromise accordingly. Key elements of the pandemic response — including distributing newly approved vaccines — will fall to the next administration. Indeed, on Monday, the drug company Pfizer announced good news about its vaccine candidate's efficacy. The Trump administration should establish collaborative councils — like those convened by Bush in 2008 — to ensure that not a moment is lost in marshaling this and other crucial policy responses.

For two weeks or more, we have been consumed by this election, staying up late to watch returns and compulsively refreshing vote counts. Unfortunately, unlike us, the virus is not distracted by politics; it is resolutely nonpartisan and absolutely tireless.

America already faces a steeply uphill battle against a pandemic that rages uncontrolled. We cannot afford further self-inflicted injuries. If we lose the next three months to petty partisan bickering and stonewalling, tens of thousands of Americans will die unnecessarily. There is not a minute to lose."

This battle will be waged on many fronts, but it’s important to keep in mind that its most essential argument is about the size of the party — and that those seeking to build a bigger Democratic Party have the stronger electoral case after the 2020 elections, just as they did following 2018.

Keeping the party’s “big tent” staked firmly in the ground is the only way to achieve policy progress in the years ahead.

More important, keeping the party’s “big tent” staked firmly in the ground is the only way to achieve policy progress in the years ahead. Democrats barely recaptured the presidency and on net lost ground in the House. Not much will get done on health care or the environment, however ambitious, without a Democratic president and swing-district legislators, and trying to narrow the party to represent just a few of the most extreme factions and the purest of the orthodoxies they champion is tantamount to waving the white flag on the entire party platform.

Joe Biden went from former vice president to president-elect because he cast a wide net for Democratic support, repeatedly seeking votes from independents and what former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg frequently referred to as “future former Republicans.”

The success of this strategy was apparent in key states he won back from President Donald Trump — and not just the “blue wall” states Democrats held from 1992 through 2012, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Biden made significant inroads in gaining back voters across education levels in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, as well, expanding support from high-education coastal cities into diversifying suburbs, along with the white working-class voters who had shifted support from Barack Obama to Trump.

Furthermore, 6 percent of 2020 voters who backed Trump four years ago supported Biden this time, a significant number when you consider these vote-switchers helped make the difference in close races in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and most likely Georgia and Arizona, as well. Overall, Biden won moderates — by some counts the largest ideological group — by a wide margin, 25 points, including winning 16 percent of moderate Republicans.

Those seeking a smaller Democratic Party are not backing down, however. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most dynamic leader of the new progressive wing, has been explicit in seeking a more exclusive Democratic Party, saying that “Democrats can be too big of a tent.” While she admirably served as a vital Biden supporter through the presidential election after endorsing democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the primaries, she didn’t abandon her smaller-tent stance.

Within two hours of the networks calling the presidential election, Ocasio-Cortez was back on offense criticizing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and arguing that the approach of her allied groups, Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, was better even though they have not yet added a single seat to the Democratic caucus since bursting onto the scene in 2018.

The only candidate Ocasio-Cortez’s alliance backed in a competitive general election against a Republican on Nov. 3 — rather than in a primary for a safe Democratic seat earlier in the year — lost by more than 4 percentage points in a Nebraska district that Biden won. Ocasio-Cortez and and her partners helped the candidate, Kara Eastman, win over a primary challenger who was backed by past Democratic senators and governors. In other words, the small-tent Democrats picked a high-risk district that, because Nebraska awards presidential electors by congressional district, could have cost Biden an elector if those who went to the polls didn’t split their vote among the parties.

Several other candidates who endorsed far-left policies also didn’t fare well, including New Green Deal supporter Rep. Debbie Muscarsel-Powell of Florida. Ocasio-Cortez erroneously told her 10 million Twitter followers that no candidates who supported the expansive plan for the environment and economy lost re-election — despite the ouster of Muscarsel-Powell, one of the few swing-seat Democrats to co-sponsor the Green New Deal in Congress.

Backers of the other hashtag policy of the far left, Medicare For All, also failed to make significant inroads in current swing districts. Though Ocasio-Cortez highlighted alleged swing district members who support the plan that would abolish private health insurance as part of government-funded health care, in actuality just two of the 20 Democratic-held seats in the current Congress rated as “toss up” or “Lean Democratic” by the Cook Political Report did so.

Moreover, far-left candidates didn’t just fail to rack up wins: Swing districts members of Congress, including Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who narrowly won re-election, blamed them for dooming other races. As those who focus on swing districts saw in polling last year, Ocasio-Cortez’s brand is potentially harmful in the districts that went from red to blue in 2018, and Ocasio-Cortez was repeatedly featured in attack ads against these candidates in 2020.

And the electoral success of more moderate Democrats is not just an anecdotal or one-time phenomenon — political science research has consistently demonstrated that moderate candidates do better at the polls. This was certainly true in the presidential primary, both on its outcome and impact on the general election. The far-left discourse in the primaries turned off voters in the middle, with one study showing that even brief exposure to the Democratic debates reduced independent support for a generic Democratic nominee by 6 percentage points, without a significant uptick in energy from the base.

What this moderate, rather than far-left, support for Democrats does is allow the party to pass policies that everyone in the big tent wants. In most significant areas — the environment, health care, social issues — mainstream and far-left Democrats share values on policy. No Democrats deny climate change, or want to reduce the government role in health insurance. Sanders has compared Biden to FDR and far-left groups called his platform “the most progressive” in the party’s history.

The fight, instead, is over control, as extremist power is inversely correlated to the size of the team. The smaller the Democratic Party, the proportionally stronger the far left.

The magnification of the influence of the extremist wing is clear on Twitter, whose discourse is dominated and distorted by this fringe. Analysis has shown just how different online progressives are from the majority of Democrats. Democrats on Twitter are far less likely to be Black, moderate, concerned about political correctness, lack a college degree or attend protests.

While subtraction may benefit some, Democrats should hope to remain the party of addition.

Luckily, the Biden campaign understood that. “We turned off Twitter,” CBS quoted a campaign aide saying. “We stayed away from it. We knew that the country was in a different headspace than social media would suggest.”

The struggle within the Democratic Party will likely be framed as left versus center in the coming months. In reality, the struggle is between the exclusive online bubble and the welcoming big tent that is Joe Biden’s America: focused on the real world, healing the country and restoring our progressive trajectory. While subtraction may benefit some, Democrats should hope to remain the party of addition."

In both red and blue states, voters rejected a racist, punitive and ineffective system for dealing with substance use and addiction. The long march toward recognizing drug use as a matter of public health, mental health and human rights and freedom just took a big leap forward.

The long march toward recognizing drug use as a matter of public health, mental health and human rights and freedom just took a big leap forward.

And it wasn’t only stereotypical libertine progressives who made 2020 a banner year for drug policy reform. Conservatives, perhaps those with a libertarian streak, in red and purple states such as Arizona, South Dakota, Mississippi and Montana voted to relax their drug laws and reject the status quo. In fact, wherever cannabis legalization or drug decriminalization was on the ballot, people decisively voted in favor of it. Voters sent a loud message to their representatives and legislators: If you don’t change this nation’s fossilized drug laws, then we will.

Before considering what these decisive wins mean for health, justice and politics, a brief recap of the new post-election landscape is in order, because the map of drug laws looks much different after election night.

A decade ago, cannabis was illegal for nonmedical use in all 50 states. Now, 1 in 3 Americans live in a state where cannabis is recreationally legal for adults 21 and older. That’s thanks to voters in Arizona, Montana and New Jersey, legalizing cannabis for recreational use this cycle. South Dakota also became the first state to legalize medical and recreational cannabis at the same time, bringing the national tally of states where cannabis is legal to 15. Heading south, Mississippi legalized medical cannabis despite the state’s Republican governor telling his constituents to vote against it, in addition to other last minute attempts to derail the vote.

But Americans didn’t only say yes to weed. Washington, D.C., joined a handful of cities that recently decriminalized psychedelic plants like psilocybin, the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Similarly, voters in Oregon approved Measure 109, which legalized the use of psychedelics at licensed facilities for mental health purposes. Research suggests that drugs like psilocybin can help people kick smoking, heal from depression and treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The federal prohibition on psychedelic drugs has long been an obstacle for researchers trying to investigate their medical potential. That’s also starting to unravel.

Oregonians delivered by far the biggest blow to the drug war by overwhelmingly voting to pass Measure 110, which decriminalized the personal, noncommercial use of all drugs, such as cocaine, meth and heroin, across the state. The ballot will simultaneously fund a desperately needed network of treatment, recovery and harm reduction services using millions of dollars in tax revenue from legal cannabis sales, as well as funds that would have otherwise been spent on policing and incarceration. In 2019, Oregon ranked dead last out of 50 states in treatment access while having the fourth highest rate of addiction, according to government surveys.

Oregonians delivered by far the biggest blow to the drug war by overwhelmingly voting to pass Measure 110.

“It’s really exciting to know that our state has said we want to do something different than what we’ve been doing,” Haven Wheelock, a harm reduction expert in Portland and one of the original petitioners who filed the measure, told me. “And now we get a chance to build and create a new system.”

You might hear from critics that Oregon “legalized” heroin. That’s why it’s important to distinguish decriminalization from legalization: No, there will be no stores in Oregon dispensing heroin, cocaine and meth, like some states do with cannabis. Nor will stores in Washington, D.C., sell magic mushrooms. Decriminalization means exactly how it sounds: penalties are no longer criminal. In Oregon, if you’re caught with personal amounts of these drugs you will receive a $100 citation and go on your way, like a speeding ticket. But that fine could be waived if you agree to a free addiction assessment at one of the new state-funded recovery centers. Portugal decriminalized drugs 20 years ago, and by many metrics, it’s been wildly successful.

It’s difficult to overstate exactly how groundbreaking Oregon’s vote to decriminalize drugs, and with nearly 60 percent of the vote, truly is. Wheelock, who also works at a syringe exchange in Portland, told me her clients who use drugs and struggle with substance issues cried joyful tears in her office the morning after election night. “I’m excited my folks won’t be in jail,” she told me. “I’m excited that when a client comes to me for help, I may now have more resources to help them.” That nagging fear of being caged and arrested that her clients feel walking around each day? It’s gone, Wheelock said.

In a dark election cycle that took place in an even darker year, what Oregon and these other states did stand out as a bright spot.

So what are we to make of the fact that cannabis legalization and drug decriminalization outperformed both presidential candidates this year? What are the political implications that whether voters went for Trump or Biden, that one thing most of us seem to have in common is our stance on drugs?

To be sure, Democrats may be much more motivated to end the drug war, roll back mass incarceration, and fight for equity in newly designed cannabis markets than Republicans in South Dakota and Montana. It’s very possible that conservative voters went green because they saw dollar signs, and care little about repairing over half a century of racist drug enforcement that disparately targets people of color. After all, cannabis is a booming business and states breaking under pandemic-induced austerity want in.

We may never divine the logic that drove conservative voters to pass cannabis legalization in their state, while simultaneously electing representatives who vehemently oppose it. But applying Occam’s razor, I think a very human answer emerges: we like the way drugs make us feel. Or, at the very least, we don’t think it’s criminal for our neighbors to dull their pain anymore. Perhaps we’re not so divided after all."
28,2020-11-09 09:30:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/rising-covid-cases-means-americans-may-face-health-care-rationing-ncna1246635,Rising Covid cases means Americans may face health care rationing. Here's how they view that.,"Through a mixture of systemic and individual failures, front-line health care workers are in an impossible position: They are, or may be, asked to make the ethically and emotionally fraught decision of who lives and who dies because of Covid-19 — and many Americans have little or no understanding of how that process works or why. This lack of understanding can lead to disagreements, exacerbate tensions between patients and care providers and even intensify feelings of grief or loss.

When hospitals are overwhelmed — whether by Covid-19 cases or other crises — decisions must be made as to how to distribute scarce medical resources. Early in this pandemic, as uncontrolled surges sprouted in Italy, Spain, New York and elsewhere, medical-resource rationing was at the forefront of ethical and policy debates. Experts agreed then and agree now that overwhelmed hospitals have a duty to steward scarce resources by using them to save the most lives but must balance that duty without devolving into ruthless utilitarianism.

It appears this debate may not stay academic much longer.

The latest surge of Covid-19 cases has arrived at America’s hospitals, with hospitalizations and positivity rates increasing at alarming rates across the Midwest. Cases per capita in North Dakota and South Dakota since the beginning of the pandemic are among the highest in the world. Health officials warn that intensive care units in El Paso, Texas, and parts of Wisconsin and Utah could exceed capacity within weeks; plans for rationing ICU beds, ventilators and even staff are being discussed in the latter.

We are in uncharted territory.

Although ethicists and health policy experts have had many discussions about how U.S. hospitals should handle a mounting wave of Covid-19 cases if capacity does become overwhelmed, we are only just beginning to learn about how the average American thinks about triage decisions in this pandemic. Understanding public attitudes toward triage, and reacting appropriately to those attitudes, could help provide legitimacy to a process that is often obscured by bureaucracy and that, without proper oversight, could have discriminatory consequences.

We set out to provide that legitimacy — and offer hospitals and health policy experts a path forward. Our study, which was published this week in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, surveyed over 1,800 Americans about triage decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic, and we came to the following conclusions.

Understanding how Americans may react to the ethically fraught decision of who lives and who dies can assist hospitals when disagreements arise.

First, even while hospitals are being overrun by Covid-19 cases, Americans generally support allocating scarce medical resources in ways that will both save the most lives and save the patients who are the worst off. By contrast, Americans broadly do not support allocating scarce resources solely on a first-come-first-serve basis, or to patients based on their potential value to society.

This result supports the model triage framework used across the United States.

Second, although Americans support the goal of saving the most lives, most were ambivalent about the forcible withdrawal of resources already allocated to patients with poor prognoses for reallocation to patients with better prognoses.

Experts have argued that, if resource constraints become dire, this practice is morally acceptable; some even speculated early in the pandemic that raiding nursing homes for ventilators might be warranted. However, our results suggest that, even if ventilator or ICU bed reallocation might be justified in philosophical theory, Americans may not be as quick to agree with the theorists. Americans tend to think that medical resources should be taken away from patients to whom they were allocated if they recover or die, not forcibly withdrawn.

Finally, we found that Americans favor revising a hospital's existing allocation plan if it is discovered that people of color are automatically disadvantaged in receiving scarce resources under that plan, even if it might lead to less lives saved overall. These results likely reflect growing concerns about health equity in America as well as the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Black and brown Americans. During the pandemic, 1 in 1,000 Black Americans have died, often due to racist social determinants of health, and our results suggest a palpable desire among Americans to correct this injustice.

(Notably, we conducted our study just before George Floyd's death — and before much of the data were available on the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on communities of color. If we repeated the study now, the attitudes in favor of revising hospitals' allocation plans that disadvantage people of color might be more pronounced.)

In many ways, our findings validate a core principle of the triage frameworks used across the United States: Steward scarce resources by saving as many lives as possible. But our research also hints at a deep desire among Americans to address issues of racial justice in the fight against Covid-19, as well as issues of access to quality health care as a whole.

These findings only give us partial insight into how to address the growing surge of Covid-19 cases in ways that will make ethical and emotional sense to most Americans. Policy makers, hospital administrators and clinicians will need to balance this information with evidence-based approaches to triage decisions. Still, understanding how Americans may react to the ethically fraught decision of who lives and who dies can assist hospitals in anticipating when disagreements could arise over such decisions, or how to prepare for the moral and emotional trauma that patients' families may experience or to which health care workers may be subjected as they care for dying Covid-19 patients day after day.

We are in uncharted territory.

The U.S. logged over 100,000 Covid-19 cases in one day for the first time this week (and then repeated it), and the vacuum in U.S. leadership has forced our health care workers to persist in the fight despite physical, emotional and moral exhaustion. We have faith in the wisdom of our front-line health care workers to make the best decisions if they are confronted with difficult triage dilemmas.

But understanding how Americans will react to those decisions may help our health care workers navigate these coming, even more difficult times."
29,2020-11-09 20:58:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-readies-herculean-effort-distribute-coronavirus-vaccine-n1247147,Pfizer readies 'Herculean effort' to distribute coronavirus vaccine,"Pfizer is marshaling a massive new cold-storage supply chain to handle the delicate dance of transporting limited doses of its coronavirus vaccine from manufacturer to any point of use within two days.

Experts say it will be a “Herculean effort” requiring several new technologies to work in flawless concert to safely deliver every dose of the drug. Pfizer said it plans to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization next week, when it has the required two months of safety data.

The vaccine will be formulated, finished and placed in cold storage in the pharmaceutical giant's Kalamazoo, Michigan, facility, its largest such plant in the country. During the shipment and storage, the vaccines must be kept at 94 degrees below zero Fahrenheit in order to maintain optimal efficacy. Each package can contain 1,000 to 5,000 doses.

From there, the vaccines will be packed below dry ice inside thermal containers expressly designed by the company for this vaccine’s delivery.

The packages will be shipped via air to major distribution hubs and then delivered by ground transport to dosing locations, which “may include hospitals, outpatient clinics, community vaccination locations and pharmacies,” Pfizer spokesperson Kim Bencker told NBC News in an email. Some vaccines will also be shipped from a separate distribution center in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin.

Each package will be equipped with a GPS-tracked thermal sensor to monitor location and temperature, which the company says will “proactively” prevent “deviations” — such as accidents or theft.

The company is bypassing its usual wholesale distribution partners, including McKesson, which is also the main partner for the government’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine project, and spent over $2 billion to create its own direct distribution network.

Once the packages are delivered, receivers can store them in ultra-low temperature freezers for up to 6 months, inside a refrigeration unit for up to 5 days, or they can refill the box with new dry ice for up to 15 days of storage.

It's a delicate operation. The company has told the CDC that it recommends the thermal shippers are not opened more than twice per day, and should be closed within 1 minute.

“We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring,” Bencker said. “Our distribution is built on a flexible just-in-time system, which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.”

The company announced Monday morning that long-awaited initial results in its blind trial, which had been expected to be released before the end of October, showed more than 90 percent efficacy. Pfizer said it had briefed President-elect Joe Biden's transition team, as well as President Donald Trump's administration.

While the positive news was greeted with cheers and relief, logistics experts say the drug giant has its work cut out.

Gen. Gustave Perna, the chief operating officer for the government’s Operation Warp Speed, which is tasked with distributing the vaccine, said Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that tracking and tracing every dose will require the use of a program called Tiberius that links databases from shipping companies and the government, a capability that didn’t exist two months ago.

Experts caution that each new piece of technology raises the difficulty factor for this operation.

“Onshelf availability for a typical grocery product is 95 percent. That is achieved with decades-old supply chain arrangements and tried and tested technologies,” Tom Goldsby, a logistics professor at the University of Tennessee, said in an email. “Here, the stakes are much higher and the room for error is so small.""

Because the vaccine requires two doses, it must be delivered to the right place at the right time and in the right shape, twice.

Pfizer's vaccine and others still in development all require subzero temperatures — and rely on several ingredients that are facing their own supply pressures.

Dry ice demand is up from various pharmaceutical makers working on vaccines and an increase in home food delivery. Supply is down as carbon dioxide, from which dry ice is made, is also down. The gas is captured during ethanol production, which has slowed as travelers drive less.

Standard glass vials will shatter in the extreme cold needed to preserve the doses, so glass manufacturer Corning has partnered with the government to create a special line, creating another supply pinch point.

Success will require a range of private and public partners to work together in perfect concert to get two bull's-eyes.

‘We will rely on professionals across the full spectrum of the supply chain from the military to civilian sector manufacturers, distributors ... transportation providers … and the health care organizations called upon to achieve this Herculean effort,” Goldsby said. “Vulnerabilities at any point in this chain can seriously reduce the effectiveness of this whole effort.”

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Monday it would be up to government health authorities to decide who gets the limited quantity vaccine and when.

By the end of 2020, Pfizer will produce enough doses for 25 million people, Bourla said, adding that sensitive groups and first responders may be able to walk in to pharmacies and receive the vaccine by the middle of 2021.

Next year, it will produce enough doses to vaccinate 630 million, with a large ramp-up in production in the later part of the year. The population of the earth is estimated at 7.8 billion.

It is unknown yet what percentage of people need to be inoculated from the coronavirus before “herd immunity,” in which sufficient numbers of a population are vaccinated so that community spread is unlikely.

“With 1,000 people dying every day in the U.S., there’s no time to lose,” Bourla said."

The FDA action specifies that the therapy is meant for adults and children over age 12 with mild to moderate illness but who have high risks of getting much worse and needing hospitalization. That includes people with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, sickle cell disease, chronic kidney disease or obesity, or anyone over age 65.

The move vastly expands doctors' ability to use Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody treatment. Previously, physicians were limited to trying the drug in clinical trials.

Eli Lilly applied for emergency use authorization in early October after the company said research suggested that the therapy could help keep Covid-19 patients from progressing to where they would need to be hospitalized.

The action ""provides health care professionals on the frontline of this pandemic with another potential tool in treating Covid-19 patients,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

Bamlanivimab is similar to one of the treatments President Donald Trump received when he was hospitalized with Covid-19. However, the FDA has stipulated that this emergency use authorization does not apply to patients who are in the hospital or who need help breathing. Regulators said such patients may, indeed, do worse if they are hospitalized in need of high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

Monoclonal antibodies are made in a lab to mimic the body's natural antibodies. The antibodies act by recognizing specific pathogens — in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 — and harnessing the immune system to fight them off.

The FDA said the decision was based on interim analysis from a phase 2 clinical trial in 465 adults with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms. The research suggested that the drug was no better than a placebo in helping patients clear the virus from their bodies; however, it did reduce the likelihood that patients would later need to be hospitalized.

Bamlanivimab is given through an IV in a single dose. In safety studies of about 800 people, the drug led to a severe allergic reaction in one person who needed an emergency medication called epinephrine to stop the reaction.

The FDA said other possible side effects of bamlanivimab include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, itching and vomiting.

Eli Lilly has already begun manufacturing the drug, and it said it could have as many as 1 million doses available by the end of the year.

31,2020-11-09 23:48:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/even-vaccine-u-s-economy-faces-long-path-toward-recovery-n1247196,"Even with a vaccine, U.S. economy faces long path toward recovery","The stock market surged Monday on promising news that Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine candidate had proved 90 percent effective in late-stage trials, signaling that some relief is on the horizon for the country's pandemic-stricken economy. But as investors sell off tech stocks for investments in beleaguered leisure or hospitality companies, market strategists and analysts warn that the economy still faces a long path toward recovery.

""The news is encouraging, but it's important to have a little bit of humility,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior director of economic research with Moody's Analytics. ""I think markets are looking a year ahead from now — if [the vaccine] is widely distributed, the economy will be healing more quickly.""

Despite news of a promising vaccine candidate, the U.S. is still on track for a slow and grueling economic recovery, economists said. Moody's still forecasts that the country will not fully recover the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic until 2024. The economy is still on course to contract by about 2.9 percent this year, according to estimates from Deutsche Bank. Meanwhile, about 13 million consumers reach a financial cliff in December when federal pandemic unemployment benefits expire.

""What we're seeing"" in Monday's stock market rally ""is a hope that a vaccine will return life to normal enough to favor those industries that have been heavily sold off,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""There is a tendency for markets to run with expectations, and those expectations are not met — and the same is true for the vaccine.""

An end to the economic turmoil from the virus depends on the delicate distribution of the vaccine, which comes with numerous risks and challenges, Pfizer said. For instance, the vaccine must be stored below 94 degrees Fahrenheit, which requires specially designed refrigerators and vials.

""There is too much risk of extrapolation here,"" Christopher said. ""We prefer investors not drop all their chips in a market that might show some disappointment in the coming weeks and months.""

While the country is not out of the woods, the prospect of a vaccine does signal a faster recovery than analysts had predicted, said Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities. That bodes well for industries that depend on in-person services, such as the leisure and hospitality industries, which lost 7.7 million jobs at the height of the pandemic. Retail lost about 1.9 million jobs to temporary or permanent layoffs at the beginning of the pandemic.

""Our view is that the cyclical sector — financials, construction, retail — should fare well, and that is simply because growth has been stronger than expected,"" Chadha said. ""The vaccine will help with that.""

As jobs rebound, consumers are likely to follow as people go back to dining out and shopping at malls, said Michael Arone, managing director of State Street Global Advisors. About half of the consumers surveyed by Bain & Co. in October said they had not been to a mall since the beginning of the pandemic. One-third of them said they are not comfortable shopping in malls or stores, and most are not comfortable with air travel.

""As more jobs are added, consumer confidence increases and consumer spending increases,"" Arone said. ""That will be important to follow through on the economy.""

However, even when the economy does start to shows signs of recovery, it will still be weaker than it was before the pandemic.

The possible vaccine ""is a giant first step in developing a health solution to what is a health problem,"" Arone said. ""What is ultimately going to be the most important is the follow-through on the market and vaccine and consumer behavior. Those are key milestones to keep an eye on moving forward."""
32,2020-11-09 20:26:16+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-promising-many-questions-remain-n1247102,"Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine promising, but many questions remain","Even with early promising results from Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine trial, significant challenges and unanswered questions remain before average Americans can get a shot. Pfizer's vaccine is a new type of technology that's never been used in mass human vaccination before and experts caution that much remains unknown about its safety, how long it might work and who might benefit most.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Pfizer's phase 3 clinical trial began in late July and has enrolled more than 43,000 study participants. Some received the actual vaccine, while other received a placebo. Vaccine trials rely on a certain number of infections to occur. If more infections are reported among study participants who received the placebo than the actual vaccine, it's a good signal of efficacy.

On Monday, the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech SE, said that early analysis show that the Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness.

The finding exceeded expectations and was met with enthusiastic optimism — along with many caveats.

That's because the drugmaker has not released full details on its preliminary analysis.

Pfizer stated that about a third of its study participants have ""racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds"" but didn't reveal if there was stronger protection for particular age groups.

""We don't know anything about groups they didn't study, like children, pregnant women, highly immunocompromised people and the eldest of the elderly,"" Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, said. And would people previously sick with Covid-19 be protected against reinfection? That remains unclear.

What's more, the Pfizer vaccine uses a brand new technology called messenger-RNA, or mRNA. It has never been approved for human vaccination before. Instead of using bits of virus to provoke an immune response, the mRNA trains the immune system to target the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus.

The spike is what allows the virus to invade human cells. In theory, blocking the spike would mean people wouldn't become infected with the virus.

""The exciting thing is that these types of vaccines can be manufactured pretty quickly,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The caution is that this would be the first mRNA vaccine to be used in humans, so it's important to look carefully at the safety data.""

It is also important to get a sharper picture of Pfizer's claim of about 90 percent effectiveness. This first analysis only included data on 94 confirmed Covid-19 cases, meaning there is no proof yet that the vaccine prevented infection.

Those who had the actual vaccine, rather than the placebo, were overwhelmingly likely to have few to no symptoms. That is, the vaccine seems to have prevented major Covid-19 complications.

It is unclear whether people who received the vaccine were less likely to be contagious.

Still, the unanswered questions should not squash early excitement about the findings, which seem to indicate that the vaccine may have the ability to transform a serious illness into something that resembles the common cold.

""The infections that we're really focusing on are the ones that lead to hospitalization,"" said Dr. Robert Citronberg, executive medical director of infectious disease and prevention at Advocate Aurora Health in Illinois. ""If those are the ones this vaccine can target, that's a huge win.""

Dr. William Haseltine, an infectious diseases expert and president of ACCESS Health International, agreed with that assessment. He predicted that if the vaccine indeed is proven safe and effective, it may work more like the flu shot.

""It's not necessarily going to protect you from infection, and it may not work for everyone,"" Haseltine said Monday on MSNBC. ""But it should be useful for many people. And it should moderate the severity of disease.""

It's also uncertain how long such protection might last. That answer can only come with time, as it's impossible to know yet whether immunity remains for months, a year, two years — or a lifetime. (For comparison, flu shots are generally only about 50 percent effective, while measles vaccines are up to 97 percent effective.)

Pfizer's chief executive officer, Albert Bourla, told CNBC Monday that the drugmaker will follow participants for two years to analyze safety and ongoing protection.

""As time progresses, we will find out about the durability of the protection,"" Bourla said. ""We will see how long the immunogenicity lasts and how long the cell immunity lasts.""

Pfizer has said it will not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine candidate until it has collected two months of safety information following the final dose of the vaccine. Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses, about a month apart.

That's likely to occur next week, when it is expected to have that safety data. There have been no serious safety concerns so far.

Alex Azar, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, told Fox News Channel Monday that the FDA will conduct an ""independent review process.""

Besser, formerly of the CDC, urged caution until ""independent eyes"" have had a chance to scrutinize the details of the findings. ""This is just one data point in a number of data points,"" he said.

In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court, Stampede Meat said it will lose millions of pounds of meat at a plant in Sunland Park, just across the state line from El Paso, Texas, and it asked a judge to throw out the order.

In court documents filed Friday, the company outlined several measures it had taken to halt the virus's spread, citing President Donald Trump's executive order April 28 invoking the Defense Production Act.

The order required meat processing plants to remain open during the pandemic.

In a letter to the company on Nov. 3, a New Mexico health official cited six positive coronavirus tests from Oct. 23 to Oct. 27 and ordered the plant to be closed for two weeks.

The New Mexico Heath Department referred questions about the suit to a spokeswoman for the state's Environment Department. The spokeswoman, Maddy Hayden, declined to discuss the suit, but she said courts have repeatedly upheld the state's authority to protect the public's health and safety.

Stampede Meat employs more than 500 workers at its Sunland Park plant. Hayden said more than 100 workers there have tested positive since the pandemic began.

Stampede did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

The United States is having its highest single-day tallies of coronavirus infections. More than 120,000 people tested positive for the virus Thursday, according to an NBC News tally.

The Midwest and the Southwest have been hit hard. In New Mexico, the number of cases steadily rose over the last two weeks, jumping from just over 700 on Oct. 8 to 1,210 on Sunday, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.

Nearby El Paso has also had a surge in infections, with the number of cases nearly doubling in the last month, according to Johns Hopkins. So many people are dying in the county that six mobile morgues have been set up, with four more on the way, officials said Monday."

Immigrant families in the U.S. say watching Trebek, who was 80 and had hosted the quiz show for 37 years, each night helped them learn English.

Asmae Toumi arrived in the U.S. from Morocco when she was 9, not knowing a word of English, and she said watching American TV shows was a big part of learning the language. She credited ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"" for some of her progress, but she also spoke about the impact of game shows like ""Wheel of Fortune"" and ""Jeopardy!""

""I remember just sitting there understanding absolutely nothing,"" she said. ""But I think the exposure to new words, just how things were expressed, just went such a long way.""

When she first got to the U.S., Toumi found making friends, expressing herself and asking questions to be nerve-wracking. TV shows like ""Jeopardy!"" helped her navigate pronunciation, expressions and nuance.

Trebek — an immigrant himself, who was born in Canada and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998 — was a staple in her family, and Toumi described his daily presence in her living room as ""irreplaceable.""

""He was one of the first people I 'met' in this country,"" she said. ""I came here with my family. I went to a French school. He was sort of the first American man that I was exposed to. His kindness and his empathy and his sense of humor, those were all huge in my cultural understanding.""

Just last week, during one of Trebek's last appearances on the program, ""Jeopardy!"" winner Burt Thakur, who is Indian, told the host about the impact he had on his own family growing up.

""I learned English because of you,"" Thakur said. ""My grandfather who raised me ... I used to sit on his lap and watch you every day.""

Sam Bautista, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines, said she grew up watching her mom learn English from Trebek.

""Growing up, my mom was learning English as I was learning to speak as a human,"" Bautista said. ""My mom always had this concern that she wasn't using the correct words or her English wasn't proper enough.""

Beyond expanding her mom's vocabulary, she said, ""Jeopardy!"" taught her and her sister about fairness, competition and education. She got emotional as she reflected on her memories of Trebek.

""He was always the pinnacle of what success was,"" she said. ""I don't know if that success directly correlates to education and intelligence, but my mom was very adamant that my sister and I took our education seriously. He was always fair. He was always right — obviously, he had the answers — but he was always fair. He never made you feel stupid for being incorrect, and I think that was huge for us.""

Fans on Twitter also spoke about Trebek's impact on their families and their memories of watching the show with their loved ones.

""I think it's important to emphasize the impact that Alex Trebek had on immigrant families,"" one user tweeted. ""I, too, watched @Jeopardy with my grandparents, who didn't speak English. Alex gave them something to look forward to every day in an otherwise unfamiliar world.""

Others reflected on what Trebek meant to their parents who immigrated to the U.S. around the time he became the host of the show.

""For 30 years my immigrant mom has been watching #jeopardy and repeating the answers 2 seconds after Alex Trebek, in broken English, pretending she knew it all along, rolling her eyes at the contestants. She will be devastated. #riptrebek,"" another user wrote.

""Jeopardy!"" executive producer Mike Richards opened the show acknowledging the ""enormous loss"" of Trebek, who died Sunday at age 80 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Trebek had hosted the game show since 1984 and was contracted to continue until 2022.

Richards stood in front of the show's set and addressed viewers with a touching tribute before the taped episode aired at its usual time slot.

""He loved this show and everything it stood for. In fact, he filmed his final episodes less than two weeks ago,"" Richards said. ""He will forever be an inspiration for his constant desire to learn, his kindness and for his love of his family.""

The show will air Trebek's final 35 episodes through Christmas Day because ""that's what he wanted,"" Richards added.

""On behalf of everyone here at 'Jeopardy!' thank you for everything, Alex,"" Richards said.

Trebek was a beloved figure in pop culture known for his calm, gentle and witty demeanor in telling contestants they had answered incorrectly. He won six daytime Emmy Awards and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2011.

It was a shock to ""Jeopardy!"" fans last year when Trebek announced that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He periodically provided health updates in taped videos posted to the show's social media accounts, offering hope on his condition.

But Trebek offered a more candid, grim reality on the state of his disease during a New York Times interview in July. He told the newspaper that if his course of treatment at the time didn't work, he planned to stop treatment altogether.

""Yesterday morning my wife came to me and said, 'How are you feeling?' And I said, 'I feel like I want to die.' It was that bad,"" he told The Times. ""There comes a time where you have to make a decision as to whether you want to continue with such a low quality of life, or whether you want to just ease yourself into the next level. It doesn't bother me in the least.""

Trebek was eulogized Sunday by dozens after news of his death broke, from celebrities to world leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trebek, who was born in Ontario, ""an icon.""

""Almost every night for more than three decades, Alex Trebek entertained and educated millions around the world, instilling in so many of us a love for trivia,"" Trudeau said Sunday on Twitter. ""My deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who are mourning this tremendous loss."""

He was 80.

The official ""Jeopardy!"" Twitter account confirmed the news, adding that he was surrounded by friends and family as he died at home in the early morning.

""Jeopardy!"" executive producer Mike Richards described Trebek's death as an ""enormous loss"" for the show's crew in a statement Sunday. The producer said it was an incredible honor to work beside Trebek in the past year and a half as the host continued to work on the show despite his diagnosis.

""His belief in the importance of the show and his willingness to push himself to perform at the highest level was the most inspiring demonstration of courage I have ever seen,"" Richards said. ""His constant desire to learn, his kindness and his professionalism will be with all of us forever.""

The beloved host continued to film episodes during his cancer treatments and shared emotional moments with fans and contestants.

Albert Thakur, who won $20,400 in Thursday's episode, was moved to tears as he shared that he used to watch ""Jeopardy!"" with his grandfather and the impact the show made on his life.

""You know, here's a true story, man. I grew up, I learned English because of you,"" Thakur told Trebek during a post-show conversation. ""And so, my grandfather, who raised me — I'm gonna get tears right now — I used to sit on his lap and watch you every day, so it's a pretty special moment for me, man.""

Thakur shared a short poem by Rainer Maria Rilke about death to his Twitter account following the news of Trebek's death, adding that he was ""overwhelmed with emotion.""

""Jeopardy!"" will continue to air episodes hosted by Trebek, who was last in studio on Oct. 29, through Christmas Day, the show said Sunday. There are currently no plans for announcing a new host.

Trebek stunned fans of the high-minded game show last year, announcing he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

Trebek said in a video posted to YouTube he would try to finish out this season of ""Jeopardy!"" despite being diagnosed with a disease that is expected to be diagnosed in 56,700 Americans this year.

Days after the announcement, Trebek addressed ""Jeopardy!"" fans again, telling them he was overwhelmed by the support he had received.

""Hi everyone, I just want to take a few moments to say thanks to the — believe it or not — hundreds of thousands of people who have sent in tweets, texts, emails, cards and letters wishing me well following my recent health announcement,"" Trebek said.

""Now obviously, I won't be able to respond to all of you individually, but I did want you to know that I do read everything I receive and I am thankful for the kind words, the prayers and the advice you have offered, and I'm extremely touched by the warmth you have expressed in your comments to me.""

The iconic game show host added, “I'm a lucky guy.""

Trebek would give updates to fans about his treatment, offering his audience good news through periodic video updates posted to the ""Jeopardy!"" social media accounts. But in a New York Times interview in July ahead of his memoir's release, Trebek was candid about the toll the disease took on him.

The game show host told the Times that if his course of treatment at the time didn't work, he planned on stopping treatment altogether.

""Yesterday morning my wife came to me and said, ‘How are you feeling?’ And I said, ‘I feel like I want to die.’ It was that bad,” he told the Times. “There comes a time where you have to make a decision as to whether you want to continue with such a low quality of life, or whether you want to just ease yourself into the next level. It doesn’t bother me in the least.”

A day earlier, he told fans his treatment was going well and that he was hopeful they would soon be able to film new episodes of ""Jeopardy!"" in a studio again. Trebek said his ""numbers are good"" and that he was feeling great.

Trebek had been the face of ""Jeopardy!"" since 1984. In October 2018, Trebek renewed his contract with Sony Pictures Television to continue as host of the quiz show through 2022.

He's best known for his calm demeanor on the show and gentle-yet-cutting manner in which he tells contestants they've answered incorrectly.

Trebek regularly tells players, ""No, I'm sorry. We were looking for ..."" or will pick out one small syllable of mispronunciation that will render a question incorrect, making the difference of plus or minus $200 to $2,000.

Trebek has won six daytime Emmy Awards and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2011.

Trebek's erudite air also made him ripe for satiric mockery, most famously by ""Saturday Night Live"" actor Will Ferrell, whose take on the ""Jeopardy!"" host was a huge fan favorite throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Ferrell's Trebek would usually become flustered by an over-the-top crude take of Sean Connery, played by Darrell Hammond, in an ""SNL"" version on ""Celebrity Jeopardy!""

The host said he found those spoofs funny and to be a compliment.

""It doesn’t bother me. If they’re spoofing you, poking fun at you or mentioning you it’s because you’re part of American pop culture, and that’s a good thing, I think,"" Trebek told The New York Post in October 2017. ""People are very polite. Nobody comes up to me or tries to insult me or test me to see if I’m as smart as I appear on TV, although that did happen quite a bit in the first couple of years, and for some reason that ended. I guess I’ve become such a part of their daily lives (that) they just take it for granted that I’m fairly well-read, fairly smart, and there’s no need to test me on that.""

Fans mourned Trebek's death on social media, including world leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trebek, born in Ontario, ""an icon.""

""Almost every night for more than three decades, Alex Trebek entertained and educated millions around the world, instilling in so many of us a love for trivia,"" Trudeau said Sunday on Twitter. ""My deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who are mourning this tremendous loss.""

Notable actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis, William Shatner and Armie Hammer also paid tribute. Hammer called Trebek the ""greatest host of one of the greatest shows of all time.""

”RIP Mr. Trebek,"" Hammer wrote. ""Thank you for always being there at the end of the day to take my mind off things.""

Curtis also thanked Trebek on Twitter, adding, ""You were grace and guts and humor and deep love.""

Two of the most famous ""Jeopardy!"" contestants, Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, also paid tribute to Trebek on Sunday. Jennings, who holds the longest-winning streak for the show, said he was thinking of Trebek's family, ""which, in a way, included millions of us.""

""Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did,"" Jennings said. ""He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I’m grateful for every minute I got to spend with him.""

Holzhauer, a professional gambler who became a household name as he competed to beat Jennings' record run, called Trebek ""an impartial arbiter of truth and facts in a world that needs exactly that.""

""It was one of the great privileges of my life to spend time with this courageous man while he fought the battle of his life,"" Holzhauer wrote. ""You will never be replaced in our hearts, Alex.""

George Alexander Trebek was born on July 22, 1940, in Sudbury, Ontario, to chef George Edward Trebek and Lucille Lagacé.

Trebek graduated from the University of Ottawa with a degree in philosophy before setting off on a brief career in news.

He worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation covering national news and special events for both radio and television arms of the national public broadcaster.

Trebek eventually became host of Canadian game shows such as ""Reach for the Top"" and ""Strategy.""

Then in 1973, Trebek moved south of the border and became host of the NBC game show ""The Wizard of Odds.""

Even though that show had a short run, Trebek kept on landing gigs, with CBS' ""Double Dare"" in 1976 to 1977, NBC's ""High Rollers"" from 1978 to 1980 and NBC's ""Battlestars"" from 1981 to 1983.

His big break came in 1984 when legendary TV host and producer Merv Griffin brought back ""Jeopardy!,"" which he originally created in 1964 and ran on NBC until 1975.

Griffin brought a new ""Jeopardy!"" to air and tapped Trebek as its host, with Sony Pictures Television doing the syndication. This second incarnation of ""Jeopardy!"" premiered on Sept. 10, 1984, and it's run for more than 8,000 episodes.

In a 2003 interview on ""Larry King Weekend,"" Griffin said he picked Trebek on the advice of his friend, Lucille Ball, and his mother.

Whitney Houston’s mother shared some emotional words about her late daughter as she celebrated the singer's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.

“I'm so very, very proud that Whitney’s being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” Cissy Houston, 87, said in a video clip from the induction ceremony on HBO. “She wanted to be something, not anything.”

The singer’s sister-in-law and manager, Pat Houston, also shared what the award would have meant to Houston.

“This is something that Whitney always wanted,” she said. “I remember in 2009 we were in London and Whitney looked at me, and she said, ‘This is really special, but there’s only one thing missing: I’ve got to get the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.’”

“Yeah, she did it,” Cissy Houston chimed in.

Whitney Houston died in 2012 at age 48. Officials said the cause of death was accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors.

Her posthumous induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is one of hundreds of awards that represent her legendary career. She has also won six Grammys, 22 American Music Awards, an Emmy and countless other accolades.

“This moment right now proves it all, that there’s only one matchless Whitney Houston,” her sister-in-law said during Saturday’s ceremony. “Tonight, she would be very proud and honored to receive this award.”

“What can I say now?” Houston’s mother said, as she reflected on accepting the honor on behalf of her daughter. “If I talk too long, I’ll cry. I don’t want to cry. So thank you.”

Musicians become eligible to enter the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 25 years after the release of their first record. Houston’s debut album, “Whitney Houston,” came out in 1985 and included some of her most popular singles, including ""How Will I Know"" and ""Greatest Love of All.”

The Notorious B.I.G. and T.Rex’s Marc Bolan were also inducted posthumously this year.

Officials in Miami said that some areas of the city saw major flooding and downed trees, though there were no reports of injuries or deaths.

More than 11,000 homes and businesses lost power, Mayor Francis Suarez said. By Monday afternoon that number had dropped to roughly 1,600, he said.

Eta made landfall late Sunday over the Florida Keys and, as of a 7 p.m. government forecast, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico.

The National Hurricane Center said the storm was 110 miles from the Western tip of Cuba.

Images showed flooded roads and homes across the region. Alex Muriel, 45, of Hialeah, north of Miami, said the storm was among the worst he'd experienced in decades. Muriel was awakened by an alert on his phone at 5 a.m. and saw the water had topped the tires of his car.

""It was raining harder than any Category 4 hurricane we have had,"" he told NBC News.

In Fort Lauderdale, Suzie Montero told NBC Miami that her family escaped their flooded home with a few belongings, but appeared to get shocked as they tried to escape.

""I was scared because my kids were in the water,"" she told the station. ""All our clothes are floating. We lost everything really.""

Forecasters had expected seven to 11 inches of rain around Miami and Fort Lauderdale. The most powerful winds recorded after Eta arrived at U.S. shores was a 71 mph gust at Carysfort Reef in the Florida Keys, but precipitation was worst overnight to the north and east of the storm's eye.

Rain was forecast for much of the state Monday, with two to four inches predicted with some areas expecting up to 18 inches, with isolated tornadoes.

Later in the week, there is more uncertainty about what track Eta will take. The current forecast meanders Eta around the Gulf through late week before potentially making a second landfall along the northern Gulf Coast of Florida late Friday into early Saturday.

The storm is part of a record-shattering 2020 hurricane season. It is the 12th named storm to make landfall on the continental United States; the previous record was nine. And Eta is Florida's first November tropical storm landfall since 1998.

Eta carved a deadly path across Central America after it made landfall Tuesday as a Category 4 Hurricane. Nicaragua recorded 140 mph winds and structural damage to buildings.

Over 100 people are reported missing in Guatemala and 27 are confirmed dead, and local authorities in Honduras say 21 have died in that country.

Twenty people were reported dead in southern Mexico."

The fireball was mainly seen over the New York and Connecticut area around 7:22 p.m. ET but reports poured in from all over the region, according to the American Meteor Society. The non-profit organization said it received more than 280 reports from people, including those in Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Québec.

Sunday’s fireball is still being investigated by the AMS, but the organization said on its website that it was traveling from East to West and ended its visible flight somewhere around Poughkeepsie, New York.

Fireballs are a type of meteor that reach a magnitude brighter than the planet Venus, according to the AMS. Though thousands of meteors hit the fireball magnitude reach Earth’s atmosphere on a regular basis, they are often masked by sunlight or occur in uninhabited areas."

After a long election week, people across the country are turning off their TVs and finally getting back to their regularly scheduled programming — for the most part. In the shopping world, it’s a big week for tech. All iPhone 12 and Pixel 5 models are now shipping. On Tuesday, Nov. 10, the Xbox will start shipping its latest gaming consoles, followed by the Playstation 5 two days later. And, of course, Black Friday sales are in full swing, too, three weeks before the traditional sales weekend. Retailers like Sephora are hosting holiday sales that offer discounts on new products, as well as top-sellers throughout the year.

While we’ll be keeping you abreast on all of that (and more), we’ve been coming across plenty of new releases recently that we’ve had to shelf for one reason or another. And so we’ve decided to share some of the most interesting new products out there with you, either because they come from brands we’ve recommended, extended product lines we know NBC News Shopping readers care about or that we simply felt moved to inform you about.

This week, we’re highlighting a handful of new products, some of which are launching just in time for the holiday season. Festive jewelry will get you in the jolly spirit and other items, like Tile’s limited-edition holiday designs, will make for great stocking stuffers. We’ve also included a collection of men’s and women’s beauty items that you can (buy for yourself or) gift come December.

The new OnePlus 8T smartphone has 5G and LTE connectivity, which allows you to quickly stream movies, download and use apps and play games. The phone’s display has enhanced color accuracy that makes images appear more vibrant on screen, as well as over 1,000 adjustable brightness levels to choose from. The OnePlus 8T — which comes in two colors: Aquamarine Green and Lunar Silver — is also equipped with Warp Charge 65, a system designed to charge the smartphone in 15 minutes. Its camera has four lenses to vividly capture pictures and videos, as well as a Nightscape mode, which helps you take clear photos in low-light. For times when you need to unplug from all the phone’s features, turn it to Zen Mode, which eliminates distractions like message notifications.

Hers, a brand that makes women’s health and personal care products, unveiled its first collection with celebrity Jennifer Lopez, which includes two new haircare products: a Rapid Repair Hair Mask and a Detox Scalp Scrub. The hair mask is made with keratin, which helps repair damaged hair, as well as hydrating ingredients that nourish hair. The scalp scrub contains salicylic acid and sugar scrub to target the buildup of product, oil and dead skin on the scalp, as well as moisturizing aloe extract. Both products are designed to give you the hair care experience you might get from a treatment at a salon in the comfort of your own home.

Watchmaker Timex and menswear designer Todd Snyder collaborated over the design of this new piece, which is a part of a series of art deco-inspired watches. It has a Quartz movement, a genuine leather strap and a stainless-steel case with a brushed and polished finish. The face features glow-in-the-dark elements on the hands and hour markers, as well as a window that displays the date. It’s also water-resistant up to 50 meters. This watch comes in two colors: Black/Turquoise and Gold/Burgundy. It can be worn with a casual pair of sweatpants or a suit, and makes a great gift for men.

While wearing these futuristic hiking boots, your feet will have extra support on the trail. Cushioning offered from compression molded foam in the midsole provides stability while walking on uneven ground, and it also absorbs impact points on the foot. The shoe has an extended heel that helps distribute weight smoothly, too. Its outsole provides traction and durability, while metal lacing hardware and a rubber toe cap protects the shoe from particularly rough terrain. This hiking boot is made from water-repellent materials, much of which is sustainable, like its recycled textile and polyester.

Curie, the maker of clean, performance-based body care products, is now selling their Hydrating Hand Sanitizer at Nordstrom stores nationwide and online. The gel hand sanitizer — which is the No. 1 selling product on Curie’s website — moisturizes hands while killing germs, and is sold in refillable, recyclable bottles. The hand sanitizer comes in three scents: Orange Neroli, White Tea and Grapefruit Cassis. It’s made with clean, hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, prickly pear seed oil and glycerin, and it won’t leave your hands smelling like alcohol. Curie’s hand sanitizer comes in 2-ounce and 8-ounce bottles, and Nordstrom also sells 8-ounce refill bottles.

Keep track of your belongings in style with Tile’s handful of new holiday designs, only available this season. Patterns include Rainbow, Camo, Oishii (a sushi print), Pet-a-palooza (pictures of cats and dogs), and more. All designs are available for the Tile Pro, and some are also made for the Tile Starter Pack — which includes one Mate and one Slim device — and the Tile Performance Pack, which includes one Pro and one Mate device. Attach your Bluetooth-enabled Tile to items like phones, keys, gym bags or luggage, and track it using the Tile app.

Jewelry in the BaubleBar’s Festive Faves holiday collection helps you dress up from the waist up for virtual parties this season. The collection consists of 25 themed earrings, featuring popular figures like menorahs, dreidels, Mr. and Mrs. Claus, Frosty the Snowman and reindeers. There are also more neutral pieces in the collection, like the Deck the Drop Earrings. Additionally, BaubleBar is selling a Giftwrap Hair Clip that adds bling to any hairdo.

Nail care brand Côte recently expanded its line of products to include items targeted towards men. Its new Men-icure Set includes everything needed to clean nails and keep them tidy. The set includes Côte's Strengthening Base Coat, Matte Top coat, a file, nail clippers, two buffers and a Côte Pilot, a brush designed to apply polish more easily. The Men-icure set also comes with a full size bottle of nail color. Customers can choose from three polish options — Abyss (charcoal grey), Marine Layer (navy blue), and Lagoon (bright blue)— all of which are new men’s colors.

The new Üllo Chill goes beyond the aerating capabilities of its predecessor. Wine is now chilled as it's poured through the adjustable purifier, which has a freezable aluminum heat-exchanger core. Place the Üllo Chill over a glass or carafe, and as room temperature wine flows through, it’s brought to an ideal 60-degree cellar temperature while sulfites and sediments are also removed. The Üllo Chill comes with four filters, a travel bag and a base to rest in when not in use.

Gearing up for the holiday season, Vitruvi, an essential oil company, released a new kit that includes single-use samples of five of the brand's best-selling blends. It features Pacific, Dusk, Ceremony, Retreat, and Clean Sweep oils, all of which have distinct aromas. Each single-use bottle has the exact amount of oil needed for one round in an essential oil diffuser, so you can pour the entire thing into the diffuser, repeating individually for each scent. The kit allows you to experiment with each oil and decide which you like best, or gift it to someone who is new to aromatherapy. Additionally, when you purchase the Discovery Kit, you get $15 off your next blends order from Vitruvi.

46,2020-11-09 15:16:56+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/harris-vp-south-asian-women-see-opening-politics-n1246411,"With Harris as VP, South Asian women see an opening into politics","After Joe Biden was projected to have won the presidency Saturday morning, Kamala Harris is set to become the next vice president of the U.S., making her the first Asian American, the first Black person and the first woman to hold the office. For many South Asians across the country, it's a historic win that has the potential to open doors for others like them.

Harris' political journey — she was the first person of Indian origin elected attorney general of California and to the Senate —will have an important impact on all women, particularly South Asian women, said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who was head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration.

""It is also an important beginning for my young sons and for children of color across our country, who have a role model in her and are watching the doors of America open wider for them,"" said Gupta, whose parents immigrated from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

In addition to Harris, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Nikki Haley, the Republican former governor of South Carolina and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, have also risen to political prominence in recent years.

These examples defy the common stereotype that South Asian women are often expected to pursue more traditional career paths over politics and aren't assertive enough to hold leadership roles.

Seema Hari, 33, a model, activist and influencer based in California, said Harris has already had an impact on the community in her state.

""You can see how it can be an inspiration for most young people who are South Asian who traditionally don't get told to join politics at all,"" she said. ""Every time I post about politics, my dad has to warn me to be careful. He's always like: 'Don't get political. Don't talk about politics on a public stage. Politics is not for you.' We're kind of trained to become only doctors and engineers and build wealth.""

For her, Biden and Harris' victory is a much-needed first step that can inspire young South Asians to be more involved in politics and activism.

But Harris' identity doesn't mean her record won't be scrutinized. Hari said she hopes Harris' win will push others to confront the impact of her tough-on-crime record during her tenures as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California.

""We've had such a big discussion around abolishing the police and defunding the police, and she comes from that background,"" Hari said. ""She's directly responsible for a lot of the laws that incarcerated a lot of people here in California. I hope that all these discussions and people being inspired right now, they can push her to change her politics.""

Dr. Hiral Tipirneni, an Indian American emergency medicine physician who was a congressional candidate in Arizona, said she hopes Harris' ascendance puts a spotlight not only on South Asian women's ethnic identities, but also on the issues they support. Tipirneni focused her own campaign on expanding affordable health care. She ran a close race against Republican Rep. David Schweikert, who was declared the winner.

""I think that diversity not just of background but also education, life experiences and opinions can help form robust policies,"" she said.

Tipirneni, 53, said one reason South Asians have been venturing into politics more is the realization that politicians should look more like the people they represent.

From 2010 to 2017, the number of South Asians living in the U.S. increased from 3.5 million to 5.4 million, according to a report by the nonprofit South Asian Americans Leading Together.

""When I was a kid growing up or in high school or college, if someone had said that a couple of decades from now an Indian American woman would hold the second-highest position in the country, I wouldn't have believed that as a possibility,"" said Tipirneni, who was born in Mumbai and moved to the U.S. at age 3.

Tipirneni said the gender roles often set for Indian women and the lack of diversity in government made her question whether to enter politics — so South Asian women will now benefit from seeing a brown face at such a high level.

Hari agreed. ""The biggest thing for South Asians is young people realizing you can be this,"" she said.

At the same time, Hari said she hopes people stay focused on policy over identity politics, saying much of the discussions surrounding Harris' ethnicity have been rife with tokenization and oversimplification, even on the part of young South Asians who seek to ""claim"" her.

""I see that in the meme culture of the youth. People are portraying her as an 'auntie,' which is what we call South Asian women who are older,"" she said. ""It doesn't sit with me really well. She's a woman, and she's intelligent, and she's capable.""

Harris' win also helps combat Donald Trump's misogyny and racism, said the creators of the Twitter account Desis for Kamala — Smitha Haridas, Mini Kunhiraman, Nikhil Govindraj and Jyothish Rajan.

They reached out to young South Asians in the months leading up to the election and encouraged them to vote Trump out.

""His conspiracy theories, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric made us and our friends unsafe,"" they said in a statement.

Because Harris is a woman of color who helped take down Trump, they said her win was ""poetic justice."""
47,2020-11-07 16:15:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-students-mississippi-s-new-state-flag-means-end-confederate-n1246860,"For Black students, Mississippi's new state flag means end of a 'Confederate relic'","JACKSON, Miss. — Eighth grader Ethan Lott had seen the Confederate battle emblem plenty of times, but he didn’t connect it with Mississippi’s state flag.

The 13-year-old had spotted the emblem — a blue X against a red square with 13 white stars — on bumper stickers and flags in front of some homes here. But it wasn’t flown in his middle school, which only raised the American flag. Ethan thought the state flag, which included the Confederate emblem in the upper left corner, was just one “white people had when they didn’t like Black people.”

It wasn’t until late October, as the state prepared to vote on a new flag design, that he learned the Confederate symbol had officially represented Mississippi for decades.

“He was taken aback,” said LaShunna McInnis, principal of Powell Middle School, who discussed the flag with Ethan. “I could see it in his face.”

McInnis had called Ethan to ask if he would participate in a ceremony that would take place at the school if voters chose the new flag.

In the years before the vote, the state flag had gradually disappeared from public schools in Mississippi’s capital. Several districts in the Mississippi Delta, too, and in other pockets of the state took down the flag with its Civil War iconography, electing to fly only the American flag.

Most of these districts were nearly all-Black and Black-led. On these campuses, leaders resisted, or at least never prioritized, displaying a symbol that has long been viewed as racist by many in the nation’s Blackest state even though Mississippi law required public schools to fly it.

Now, after Mississippi voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to replace the flag’s Confederate imagery with one featuring the state’s official flower, a magnolia, and the phrase “In God We Trust,” schools that balked at flying the state flag are now planning to hoist it for the first time in recent history.

McInnis, who is Black, watched “The Dukes of Hazzard” growing up. As a child, she didn’t think much about the rebel flag on top of “General Lee,” a car featured prominently on the show named after Gen. Robert E. Lee, the Confederate army leader. But as a principal of a school where almost all the students are Black and some live with grandparents or older relatives who lived through the Jim Crow South, or whose parents did, she thought differently.

“Having that flag flying above definitely would have been a source of tension,” she said.

Frank Figgers, vice chair of the Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement, says some school districts likely removed the state’s flag after the passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Voting Act. Black voting power helped to diversify elected school boards that then quietly had the flags taken down. Other schools, he said, likely never displayed the banner even during segregation.

Growing up in 1960s Mississippi, Cheryl Turner couldn’t escape the symbol once carried into battle by Confederate soldiers. The image was always looming. On walks home from school when Turner and her siblings would look for pecans on the grounds of the state Capitol in Jackson, the state flag was waving in the background.

The shadow of the Confederacy was also cast over her elementary school, which had recently begun integrating when she started fifth grade there in 1966.

At the time, the campus was named for Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. She was spared from the mobs that had attacked Black children integrating schools in the north Mississippi town of Grenada that same year, but she still has hurtful memories. A white teacher questioned whether Turner and other Black students would be able to keep pace with their lessons.

She’s not sure if the state flag flew at her elementary school. But in college, she couldn’t miss it.

At the University of Mississippi, crowds waved the rebel flag like pompoms inside Vaught-Hemingway Stadium so much that she didn’t feel comfortable attending football games to watch a home team nicknamed the Rebels.

“Being a student there was the first time I really felt the angst of the flag,” she said.

The defiance of some public schools in deciding to ignore state law and not fly the flag ignited a failed attempt in the state Legislature in 2015 to potentially strip accreditation from such districts. A white state representative told reporters that the legislation was prompted by the flag’s absence from schools, The Clarion Ledger reported. The measure passed in the House Education Committee, but failed to become law. In 2016, a woman sued a north Mississippi school district in an attempt to force officials to fly the flag.

The Legislature’s turnaround from potentially punishing districts for not flying the flag to replacing it happened amid widespread demonstrations across the nation against racial injustice this summer.

In June, thousands marched in downtown Jackson in one of the largest protests in the state in decades. A new state flag was among the demands.

In July, Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, signed legislation to replace the state flag. The law required that the new design be approved by voters with a mandate that it included the phrase, “In God We Trust” and excluded the Confederate battle emblem.

On Wednesday, a day after Mississippi voters approved the new design, Ethan and McInnis attended two small flag-raising ceremonies at Powell Middle School and at the district’s downtown office.

Ethan’s grandfather attended and several generations watched as a junior ROTC unit from Forest High School pulled the flag up the pole. There was a reverent silence as the banner waved in the wind.

The new flag flew for only one day at Powell, as school officials wait until January for the Legislature to officially ratify it. Because of the pandemic, Jackson students won’t return to in-person classes before the end of this year. Ethan hopes that when schools physically reopen the new flag will be there to greet them.

“It’s always important to learn about past history to build up your future,” Ethan said. “It did represent our state once.” He wants his classmates and the next generation to know “the steps it took to change the state flag.”

Turner is grateful young Mississippians won’t grow up in the shadow of the Old South like she did.

In 2017, students, parents and educators voted to rename Jefferson Davis Elementary, her alma mater, named after the Confederate president, to the Barack Obama Magnet School, in honor of the nation’s first Black president.

Now, Turner has a sign emblazoned with the new state flag in her front yard. She’s thankful that her 7-year-old granddaughter, Kaylen, and her young grandson, Ian, won’t be confronted with relics of the South’s worst transgressions. The flagpole outside their school won’t fly a Civil War symbol. Her school’s name won’t honor the Confederacy.

“In just a little while no one will know this school was named Jefferson Davis,” she reflected. “They’ll just know it was Barack Obama. That’s all she knows. It’s great they won’t have that connection to a Confederate relic.”"
48,2020-11-09 14:01:35+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/after-joe-biden-win-over-donald-trump-relief-sweeps-u-n1246725,"After Joe Biden's win over Donald Trump, relief sweeps through America's allies","LONDON — Sighs of relief rippled through capitals of longtime U.S. allies around the world after Joe Biden became president-elect on Saturday.

Many leaders have been battered by four years of the convention-smashing President Donald Trump and see in Biden a counterpart who will try and return America onto a path of multilateralism and international cooperation.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a fraught relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to issue a statement congratulating Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris.

""Our two countries are close friends, partners, and allies. We share a relationship that's unique on the world stage,"" Trudeau wrote soon after news emerged that Biden had won the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, according to NBC News projections. ""I'm really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both.""

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was less diplomatic.

""Welcome back America!"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their election!""

Messages from foreign leadersand officials are common when a new U.S. president is elected. Less common, however, is the number this time around who have been referring to the previous administration — perhaps tacitly signposting their relief that it's over — when delivering their congratulations.

There were many mentions of the challenges the new White House faced.

Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven congratulated Biden and mentioned the need for ""multilateralism"" — something the Trump administration has explicitly shunned.

My warmest congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Looking forward to strengthening excellent US-Swedish relations and to work jointly for multilateralism, democracy and global security. Together, we can lead a green transition creating jobs for the future. — SwedishPM (@SwedishPM) November 7, 2020

New Zealand Prime Minster Jacinda Ardern — lauded for her response to the coronavirus pandemic and the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 people — celebrated Biden's victory before saying there were ""so many issues facing the international community.""

French President Emmanuel Macron also noted the international challenges piling up on the president-elect's desk.

The Americans have chosen their President. Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris! We have a lot to do to overcome today’s challenges. Let's work together! — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 7, 2020

The rush of congratulations from many Europeans made sense given Biden's long track record as a supporter of strong trans-Atlantic ties.

""Biden will be more diplomatic toward allies across the board, but particularly toward Europeans,"" Hans Kundnani, a senior research fellow focusing on Europe and trans-Atlantic relations at the U.K.-based think tank Chatham House, said before the election. ""Europeans will be extremely relieved.""

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom Trump has publicly criticized, congratulated Biden after he was named president-elect Saturday. On Monday, she spoke warmly of the former vice president in a speech.

""I sincerely congratulate Joe Biden to his election as the 46th President of the United States of America. Joe Biden brings the experience of decades in domestic and foreign policy with him. He knows Germany and Europe well. I fondly remember meetings and conversations with him,"" she said.

Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the ""clear figures"" that propelled Biden to victory.

Relations with the European Union, NATO and, in particular, Germany were strained under Trump.

""I know Joe Biden as a strong supporter of our alliance,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote. ""A strong NATO is good for both North America and Europe.""

Minutes after NBC News and others projected Biden's victory, Ireland's prime minister, Micheál Martin, offered his congratulations via Twitter. Biden is one of the 30 million Americans who identify as Irish — his great-great grandfather emigrated from County Mayo to the U.S. in 1850.

On the campaign trail Biden warned the United Kingdom not to allow Brexit to risk the safety of the Good Friday Agreement, a 1998 peace deal between rival Irish factions that put an end to the sectarian conflict known as the Troubles.

I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA @JoeBiden Joe Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. I also look forward to welcoming him back home when the circumstances allow! 🇮🇪 🇺🇸 — Micheál Martin (@MichealMartinTD) November 7, 2020

To that end, while U.K. Prime Minister 's Boris Johnson also quickly issued a congratulatory message, referring to the U.S. as Britain's ""most important ally,"" his message was not as enthusiastic as those of some of his counterparts.

Biden has spoken against Britain's exit from Europe, a cause championed by Johnson, and in December he referred to Johnson as the ""physical and emotional clone"" of Trump, according to The Hill.

On the other side of the globe, Australia, an important U.S. ally and a partner in managing its relations with China, welcomed Biden's win.

""I particularly look forward to this with President-elect Biden because he comes to this relationship with a deep experience and a deep history,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Sunday.

Elsewhere, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who is of South Asian American descent. He called Harris’ success “pathbreaking” and “a matter of immense pride” for all Indian-Americans.

However, not everyone may be overjoyed at the prospect of a Biden presidency.

A sense of unease is likely coursing through parts of the Middle East, where Trump's White House has had especially close relationships with the leaders of longtime U.S. partners Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Egypt.

""They are going to try to coexist with Biden and make the best of a bad situation from their point of view,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. ""They put most of their eggs in Trump's basket — he's been good to them.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu, one of Trump’s closest international allies, took until Sunday to tweet his congratulations to Biden, calling the president-elect “a great friend of Israel.”

But he also thanked Trump for “the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally” as well as for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and standing up to Iran.

Trump is very popular in Israel, where 71 percent of people expressed confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs in a 2019 Pew Research Center poll.

However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement Sunday he hoped to work with Biden to strengthen the Palestinian-American relations. Palestinians have been holding out for a change of U.S. president for three years after being largely ostracized by Trump.

Iran's president Hassan Rouhani called on Biden to ""compensate for past mistakes"" and return the U.S. to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a state-run news agency reported Sunday. The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the deal and placed crippling sanctions on the country.

Meanwhile, though Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will work with any U.S. leader, Biden's win will be perceived as a net negative for Russia, Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said before the election.

There has been no official comment from Russia about Biden's win. But opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who was recently poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, congratulated Biden and Americans for “defining the new leadership in a free and fair election,” something he called “a privilege which is not available to all countries.”

Biden called Russia the biggest threat to U.S. national security last month — an assessment the Kremlin said encouraged hatred of Russia.

""Moscow is paying close attention to this and does not like what it sees,"" Frolov said.

China, which has been in a bitter dispute with Trump over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Beijing's handling of the pandemic and many other issues, have remained quiet on Biden’s win so far.

Meanwhile Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, welcomed Biden's victory and said he looked forward to working with the new administration.

Trump took the unprecedented step in May of pulling the U.S. out of the WHO — a decision Biden promised to reverse ""on day one"" if elected.

Tedros said in a speech Monday that since Trump signaled he would pull out of the 2015 Paris Accord on climate change, ""the creeping guidance of nationalism and isolationism have eroded our sense of common purpose"" in scientific progress.

""In that spirit, we congratulate president elect Joe Biden and VP elect Kamala Harris and we look forward to working with this administration very closely,"" he said."
49,2020-11-08 11:00:19+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/frustrated-internet-service-providers-cities-schools-push-more-data-n1246698,"Frustrated by internet service providers, cities and schools push for more data","Months into the school year, the one thing many families have learned is how much they rely on a functioning internet connection to access remote classrooms. So education equality experts who are trying to chip away at the many challenges families are struggling with through the pandemic are starting by simply trying to identify which students aren't connected to make sure those households have access to affordable packages.

But even though most internet service providers, or ISPs, offer affordable packages, they refuse to say how many customers they have signed up for the programs. That is forcing some city officials and internet equality groups to take data-gathering into their own hands.

In Philadelphia, city officials have struggled to get the data from Comcast, one of the nation's largest ISPs and the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. So city officials contacted families directly to find out whether they have internet service. Philadelphia said that as of Oct. 21, after a media campaign, surveys and canvassing, it had been able to bring over 11,000 families online since March. In Nashville, Tennessee, a group is starting its own digital divide census, because it isn't counting on ISPs like Comcast and AT&T to help.

""I don't think that we should rely on companies to give proprietary data,"" said Fallon Wilson, a co-founder of the National Black Tech Ecosystem Association. ""They're not going to do that.""

It doesn't look like ISPs are providing this information any time soon. Five of the country's largest ISPs, including Charter (also known as Spectrum), AT&T, Verizon and Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), in addition to Comcast all declined to provide information about how many low-income customers had signed up for their programs. They all said the information was proprietary.

But it becomes clear very quickly that providing the information offers results. Cox, an ISP that serves Las Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta and other cities, provides the information, and school officials have already seen that more students are getting coverage.

As coronavirus case numbers rise and even more children switch to remote learning, educators and elected officials are feeling greater urgency to get access to the information.

""It matters right now,"" said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, who has expressed frustration that ISPs will only say how many people they have helped in the years since they started offering affordable Internet instead of during the coronavirus pandemic. ""It doesn't matter over the life of the program.""

Limited data

Many large ISPs, including Comcast and Charter, started offering affordable programs because the government ordered them to. The Federal Communications Commission required ISPs to provide such services to low-income households as a condition of corporate mergers. However, while they disclose the figures privately to the FCC, they then redact the figures for the public. A spokesperson said the FCC still considers the data proprietary.

Comcast said it provides service to more low-income families than all of its competitors combined — over 8 million through its Internet Essentials program in the past decade. But it didn't provide specifics about how many people it has actually signed up through the pandemic.

""We don't report active subscribers and instead report lifetime connects,"" Charlie Douglas, a Comcast vice president, said by email, saying such a metric is an ""industry standard"" across telecommunications companies.

Longtime fights

It's a battle that public interest groups were fighting well before the coronavirus pandemic began, said Christopher Mitchell, director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group that works on broadband issues. He said it's time for state and federal government agencies to step in.

""The FCC and states should be requiring broadband companies to submit basic data about these issues and it should be made publicly available,"" he said by email. ""Public interest groups have argued for this for years but the providers frequently claim it is all proprietary data they cannot let their rivals know about.""

But educators and advocacy groups have started to push harder for the data, especially given that some districts that had reopened for in-person learning are closing again.

In California, advocacy groups, including United Ways of California and other education-focused organizations, sent a formal letter to the state's Closing the Digital Divide Task Force seeking better data from major companies that serve the state, including Comcast and Spectrum. About one-third of all students in the state don't have access to an internet connection or a digital device, according to data tracked by the Public Policy Institute of California.

""Although the State does issue broadband reports, they are not sufficiently specific to those who are not connected and/or under-connected; and, much like ISPs' reports they focus on access and adoption rates but there simply isn't enough comprehensive data on obstacles facing existing and potential subscribers,"" the letter states.

Taking charge

In Philadelphia, where Comcast is headquartered, local leaders have asked multiple times in meetings for it to disclose the levels of Internet Essentials usage and have sent letters and emails. But the company has said the figures are confidential and proprietary.

Without the information from Comcast or the other large ISPs that serve Philadelphia, the city has had to do its own research, said Mark Wheeler, the city's chief information officer. That's the only way to determine where to direct municipal efforts, a process that is slower and more complex without the figures.

""We would love that type of data. It would be extremely helpful for us in terms of knowing who is and who isn't a subscriber,"" Wheeler said. ""Where do we do our outreach? We don't have unlimited amounts of money.""

In the meantime, Wheeler said, the city is trying to reach out directly to families who can benefit from the Internet Essentials program in Comcast's hometown as part of the city's new PHLConnectED program, which streamlines the sign-up process for needy families.

Under the program, the city has managed to sign up nearly 8,000 households. But the city still doesn't know who else Comcast has already signed up under Internet Essentials.

""Since the City is the sponsor (in Comcast terms) of the service agreement, we only get exact figures on the number of subscribers in that service agreement for PHLConnetED,"" Wheeler said in an email. ""We do not get Internet Essentials subscriber counts that exist in the entire boundary of the city.""

Wilson, of the National Black Tech Ecosystem Association, is working to create a digital divide census for Nashville, because she wasn't confident that ISPs would share this information with her in the first place. Comcast and AT&T are the large providers, and they won't disclose such figures. While Google Fiber also serves Nashville, it doesn't offer any low-cost option. But it provided a $50,000 grant to the Nashville Public Education Foundation. So Wilson hopes to ultimately create a ""digital inclusion commission"" — a municipal body responsible for monitoring the information.

Digital feedback

When ISPs provide the data, education advocates are able to identify those who need internet service much more quickly. Cox, which is a major provider in cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix, serves 140,000 low-income families under its Connect2Compete plan, spokeswoman Shana Keith said. More than one-tenth of Cox's nationwide low-income connections are in Clark County, Nevada, home to Las Vegas.

Cox's disclosures, combined with the state efforts to disclose information, have offered much better results. Nevada has even maintained an online scoreboard where anyone can see how a given district is doing in terms of connectivity and get clear instructions if remaining families need technical assistance. The results have been stunning: Melinda Malone, a Clark County School District spokeswoman, said 18,355 families have been connected, ""most of which is through Cox Connect2Compete.""

That has meant that across the Clark County School District, fewer than 1,000 of over 315,000 students remain unconnected, and the relationship between the ISP and the school district has been much stronger.

""Cox has been a great partner to the District,"" Malone said. ""Cox has helped us work through any problem that has come up."""
50,2020-11-10 01:18:02+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-defense-secretary-mark-esper-has-been-terminated-n1247138,Trump tweets that Defense Secretary Mark Esper has been 'terminated',"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday that he fired Mark Esper as his defense secretary and said Christopher Miller would serve as the acting secretary of the Department of Defense.

""I am pleased to announce that Christopher C. Miller, the highly respected Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (unanimously confirmed by the Senate), will be Acting Secretary of Defense, effective immediately,"" Trump tweeted, announcing his first personnel move since losing the presidential election.

He added, ""Chris will do a GREAT job! Mark Esper has been terminated. I would like to thank him for his service.""

Esper's ouster was Trump's first personnel move since losing the election. Esper has been working with Congress recently to strip Confederate names from military bases, which Trump opposes.

Trump's announcement comes after NBC News reported last week that Esper had prepared a letter of resignation. NBC News has previously reported that Esper has long been at odds with Trump. The two disagreed, for example, about the use of active-duty troops to respond to protests across the nation this summer.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, excoriated the president in a statement on Monday, calling Esper's firing an attempt ""to sow chaos.""

“The abrupt firing of Secretary Esper is disturbing evidence that President Trump is intent on using his final days in office to sow chaos in our American Democracy and around the world,"" she said. ""Continuity and stability are always important during a presidential transition; they are absolutely imperative at this moment, as this historically erratic Administration prepares for its departure.""

She added, ""It is disturbing and dangerous that, at this precarious moment, our military will now be led by an official who has not been confirmed for this position by the Senate.”

Esper also distanced himself from Trump’s photo-op at St. John’s Episcopal Church after a crowd of protesters was violently dispersed from Lafayette Square during the protests over police brutality this summer.

Esper also said he would not support Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to quell civil unrest during the protests when Trump was threatening to do so.

Further, Esper attempted to cut funding in the Pentagon budget for Stars and Stripes, a newspaper for U.S. military personnel that has been published since the Civil War, which Trump pushed back on.

Esper said in a statement, ""I am particularly proud of these accomplishments in light of the challenges we faced along the way: a global pandemic; confrontations with Iran and its proxies throughout the Middle East; continued deployment of troops into conflict zones; domestic civil unrest; malign behavior globally by Russia and China; and a charged political atmosphere here at home. Through thick and thin, however, we have always put People and Country first.""

Esper had served as defense secretary since July 2019, taking over from Jim Mattis, who resigned from the role in late 2018. Mattis had also been critical of Trump's approach as commander in chief.

Miller, meanwhile, has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center since August. Before that, he served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism. Miller served in the military from 1983 to 2014, according to the Defense Department.

Given that Trump named Miller as the acting secretary, it's unlikely the president will formally nominate Esper's replacement before he leaves office in January. Once President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January, he will have the power to nominate his own secretary of defense, whom the Senate would have to confirm."
51,2020-11-09 14:26:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-congratulated-trump-almost-immediately-2016-not-after-biden-win-n1247072,Putin congratulated Trump almost immediately in 2016. Not Joe Biden.,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump for winning the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Yet on Monday, days after Joe Biden was projected to have won the presidency, Putin remained silent as other world leaders moved to congratulate Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris.

Speaking to reporters Monday in Moscow, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov explained the silence in diplomatic terms: Russia does not believe it would be correct to congratulate a winner before an official ruling has been made, and he noted that Trump is moving forward with legal challenges to the results.

""The incumbent president has announced certain legal procedures, so this situation is different, and we consider it correct to wait for an official announcement,"" Peskov said, adding that ""the differences are quite obvious"" between the 2016 election and the 2020 election. ""There were no announcements of legal challenges"" last time.

In taking that position, the Kremlin appears to be latching on to Trump's unfounded claims of voter fraud. Trump has so far refused to concede defeat, promising Saturday to press forward with legal challenges, saying — without providing any evidence — that illegal ballots were counted in several states.

Neither Trump nor his campaign have been able to produce any evidence to back up their claims.

Republicans in Congress have largely avoided the issue, although some in Trump's orbit have encouraged him to keep fighting and others have urged him to tone down his rhetoric.

None of that has stopped Russian state media and various government officials below Putin from taking the claims and running with them. The message being pushed to Russian audiences is this: U.S. claims to operating a model democratic system are lies; there is no free and fair electoral process in America.

On Sunday night, one of the Kremlin's most prominent mouthpieces, Dmitry Kiselyov, repeated Trump narratives about mail-in ballots on his flagship ""News of the Week"" program on state television — that an overwhelming majority of them were cast for Biden and that ""voting by mail allows for cheating.""

There is no evidence to substantiate the claim that voting by mail allowed for more cheating than other methods of voting.

In many ways, the Russian state television narrative mimicked not only Trump's accusations of improprieties, but also the accusations of fraud and manipulation that Russia often faces from Western media and observers.

Trump's refusal to concede and his claims of fraud have given state media room to characterize American democracy as a sham. The reports, aimed at Russian audiences, are ultimately intended to undermine any admiration Russians may have for the U.S. as a model democracy.

But some in Russia see the hotly contested outcome as evidence that the U.S. is a model.

Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in Germany recovering from an attempted poisoning in Russia with a deadly nerve agent, wrote last week on Twitter: ""Woke up, went on Twitter to see who won. At the moment, it isn't clear. Now that is election.""

Navalny was the first prominent Russian political figure to congratulate Biden on his victory in what he wrote was a ""free and fair election.""

""This is a privilege which is not available to all countries,"" Navalny wrote Sunday on Twitter."
52,2020-11-09 19:30:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/british-politician-slammed-after-calling-kamala-harris-indian-n1247148,UK politician slammed after referring to Kamala Harris as 'the Indian',"A member of the Northern Ireland Assembly received heavy criticism on Monday for referring to U.S. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as “the Indian” on Twitter.

In his since-deleted tweet on Monday, Lord Kilclooney, a member of the House of Lords, said: “What happens if Biden moves on and the Indian becomes President. Who then becomes Vice President?”

On Saturday, Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American, and first Black South Asian American vice president-elect in U.S. history.

Lord Fowler, lord speaker of the House of Lords, demanded that Kilclooney apologize.

“Lord Kilclooney should retract and apologize,” he said on Twitter on Monday. “This is an offensive way to refer to anyone, let alone a woman who has just made history.""

“The comment is entirely unacceptable and has no place in British politics. I could not be clearer,” he said.

Kilclooney has not apologized for his statement and denied it was racist on Twitter on Monday.

“Harris is rightly proud of her Indian background I certainly withdraw my reference to her as an Indian as it seems to have upset some people,” he tweeted. “I did not know her name and identified her with the term Indian.”

Whilst Biden is proud to be Irish and Harris is rightly proud of her Indian background I certainly withdraw my reference to her as an Indian as it seems to have upset some people. I did not know her name and identified her with the term Indian. Most people understood.Racist NO. — Lord John Kilclooney (@KilclooneyJohn) November 9, 2020

This isn’t the first time the Irish lawmaker received backlash for identifying politicians of color solely by their ethnicity.

In 2018, Kilclooney drew ire from British lawmakers after he called Leo Varadkar, then the prime minister and head of government of Ireland, a “typical Indian,” BBC reported. Varadkar, of Indian and Irish descent, is currently the deputy head of Ireland.

Wes Streeting, British Member of Parliament for Ilford North, echoed Fowler’s comments on Twitter on Monday.

He did it before to Leo Varadkar and now he's done it to Kamala Harris. This sort of racism would be unacceptable from anyone, but from a member of the House of Lords it beggars belief. Action must be taken. https://t.co/2JbWFbqr9r — Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) November 9, 2020

“This sort of racism would be unacceptable from anyone, but from a member of the House of Lords it beggars belief,” Streeting tweeted. “Action must be taken.”"

That's the average day for millions of schoolchildren in China, as the country where Covid-19 was first identified has all but declared victory over the coronavirus.

The strict oversight measures helped more than 240 million students from kindergarten to university return to class in September, according to the county's education ministry.

""For students, they all understand it's the practice we use to keep them safe at school, so they all follow it,"" said Li Hailong, an English teacher at a primary school in Beijing.

Restrictions in China are similar to those in place throughout Europe and the U.S., but widespread levels of public adherence appear to be making a difference.

Woven into the fabric of everyday life is a system of health codes that assign color-coded designations based on a person's health status. Masks, temperature checks and mass testing are ubiquitous.

The Chinese government has been criticized for its lack of openness and minimizing the severity of the outbreak at its outset. The country has also been accused of mishandling the initial phase of the outbreak and silencing whistleblowers.

President Donald Trump has been one of the most vocal critics, accusing Beijing of early failures that enabled the virus to spread more quickly.

But 10 months after the virus emerged, life is nearing pre-pandemic normality in China, to an extent not seen in most other countries.

""They have done an amazing job of controlling the virus,"" said Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and a former official with the international health program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But such success is possible only through restrictions on individual freedoms, he said, that would not be tolerated in the U.S. and other democracies.

In the strict lockdown in Wuhan, the city in central China where the virus first emerged in January, authorities took draconian measures to stop people from entering or leaving.

""Reports indicated very strong compliance with the measures that were required of the people,"" said David Harper, a senior fellow with the Global Health Program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.

""The system that exists in China allows for this central political directive to be taken through to be implemented with enforcement at the local level in a way that doesn't exist in many other countries around the world,"" Harper said.

China, a country of 1.4 billion people, has not reported a single Covid-19 death since April 26, according to the country's National Health Commission — the only official source of information about coronavirus infection rates in China. NBC News could not independently verify the reported numbers.

The country has reported 86,212 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic started. By contrast, nearly 10 million cases and more than 230,000 deaths have been recorded in the U.S. alone, according to NBC News' tally.

Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 1.2 million people, with nearly 50 million confirmed cases, according to John Hopkins University data.

""China is puzzling everybody,"" Mokdad said, adding that several factors could be in play.

The memory of the 2002 SARS epidemic, which killed nearly 800 people and led to economic damage, made the Chinese more likely to wear masks and socially distance early on during this year's outbreak, he said.

Since the SARS scare, the country has revamped its public health system, said Qifang Bi, a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, who has conducted Covid-19 research in coordination with researchers at the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Although the CDC still faces many challenges, its success in bringing cases down amid a global pandemic does show that the public health system has come a long way since SARS,"" Bi said.

At the outset of the Covid-19 outbreak in China, she said, an early and strict lockdown in Wuhan played a crucial role in buying other parts of the country precious time to activate their public health responses, preventing a surge of cases.

But most important, Mokdad said, was a government response that involved clear and consistent messages.

""There was a national mandate, and everyone adhered to it,"" he said.

As Europe and the U.S. continue to face a massive surge of new cases, China has been eager to show off its success in containing the virus.

Beijing's world famous auto show, which was postponed in April, opened its doors in September, becoming the first major auto show to have done so since the pandemic. It was crammed with people, with nearly everyone wearing masks.

In Wuhan, a sports arena that was used as a makeshift hospital at the height of the pandemic hosted a basketball game before 7,500 fans last month, local media reported.

In the country's biggest test yet, more than 600 million Chinese traveled across the country in the first week of October to mark the midautumn festival, a traditional occasion for families to get together and mark the national holiday celebrating the founding of communist China.

As the holiday week wrapped up, the state-run newspaper Global Times reported overcrowded tourist spots and said people were sharing posts about being stuck in traffic jams again — calling congestion ""the happiness"" that other countries want but ""can't have right now.""

“Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has adopted the most comprehensive, strictest and thorough prevention and control measures,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said last week. “Facts have proved that China’s epidemic prevention and control measures are effective,"" he added.

But China is far from being out of the woods, and the holiday travel was a big test for the country, Mokdad said.

While domestic travel in the first week of October does not appear to have led to any new cases, a cluster of cases was reported in Qingdao, in eastern Shandong province, prompting nearly 11 million residents to be tested. Before cases in Qingdao, China had reported no locally transmitted infections since Aug. 15.

At the end of October, after testing 4.7 million people, authorities placed the far western city of Kashgar into lockdown after a new cluster of cases was discovered.

China is also tightly guarding against the virus's coming from abroad.

On Thursday, it barred non-Chinese travelers from nine countries, including the U.K. and France, as the coronavirus situation continues to deteriorate around the world.

""If they don't maintain the good behavior and start letting down their guard, they will see a surge again,"" Mokdad said."
54,2020-11-09 23:07:50+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/jamie-dimon-jeff-bezos-other-business-leaders-react-biden-harris-n1247179,"Jamie Dimon, Jeff Bezos and other business leaders react to Biden, Harris victory","Business leaders across all sectors are reacting to Saturday's news that former Vice President Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the presidential election, hailing an end to the divisiveness and praising the character of the next commander-in-chief — while acknowledging the struggles ahead.

""Unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who has had his share of disputes with Trump, wrote on Instagram. ""Congratulations President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris. By voting in record numbers, the American people proved again that our democracy is strong.""

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase echoed that sentiment, saying in a statement, ""Now is a time for unity,"" and calling for Americans to come together and move forward with the outcome after Trump refused to concede.

""We must respect the results of the U.S. presidential election and, as we have with every election, honor the decision of the voters and support a peaceful transition of power,"" Dimon said.

In 2018, Dimon received some sharp backlash from Trump after he claimed that he could defeat the president if he chose to run.

Other business leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, focused on the immense task of beating back the coronavirus.

""Congratulations to President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris on their victory,"" Solomon said in a statement. ""We are ready to engage as they confront the important challenges of tackling the pandemic and rebuilding the economy.""

Gates tweeted that he looks ""forward to working with the new administration and leaders on both sides in Congress on getting the surging pandemic under control"" following his numerous criticisms of the Trump administration's response.

Gates told The Wall Street Journal this year that he had warned Trump as early as 2016 that the country could face a pandemic.

Krishna of IBM offered advice on behalf of his company in a letter addressed to Biden, with one piece also aimed at the president-elect's coronavirus response plan.

""As you convene a Covid-19 task force, we recommend that your administration also establish a Scientific Readiness Reserve — a body of scientists and computing resources from the private sector that can be swiftly mobilized in times of crisis,"" Krishna advised, saying IBM has already ""laid some groundwork"" to advance research into treatments for the coronavirus.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not commented publicly about the election results. Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, chose to highlight what Harris' win means for the U.S.

""There are times when America takes a big step toward creating a government that reflects the diverse country we are,"" Sandberg wrote in a Facebook post. ""Today is one of those days. I'm thinking with joy about young people across the country watching the news today and thinking, 'Maybe I can lead this nation too.'""

The Business Roundtable also congratulated the incoming administration, saying, “In the days ahead, it is critical that we move forward together to strengthen our country. As we enter another period of closely divided government, we call on elected officials and Americans across the political spectrum to work in good faith to find common ground. Our country faces great challenges in the months ahead to defeat the pandemic and rebuild our economy. We will meet them only by working together.”

Trump has often frustrated executives with his rash implementation of tariffs and boycotts, some of which came without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff."

U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German biotech company BioNTech made the announcement Monday morning, citing data from their late-stage vaccine trial.

""This is a game changer,"" Albert Bourla, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, told CNBC on Monday morning. He wrote in an official statement, ""Today is a great day for science and humanity.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day with a gain of around 835 points, having soared by more than 1,700 points earlier in the trading session. The S&P 500 closed up by 1.2 percent after it rallied to a record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which also touched record levels, closed the day's session in the red, down by 1.6 percent as stay-at-home stocks fell out of favor.

Shares in travel and hospitality had huge gains all day after the Pfizer announcement on hopes that a return to normality would elevate passenger demand and visitor numbers. The casino operator MGM Resorts and Delta Air Lines both surged by 18 percent, and Royal Caribbean cruise lines soared by 25 percent.

High-growth tech stocks took the biggest hit Monday, as sectors that have benefited from the pandemic became hot potatoes. Shares in the videoconferencing company Zoom plunged by almost 20 percent.

The tech sector prospered throughout coronavirus-induced lockdowns, with stocks such as Amazon surging by close to 100 percent since the beginning of the pandemic and Netflix's market capitalization growing by around $100 billion.

Monday's rally, the biggest since February, built on post-election gains, which came as former Vice President Joe Biden emerged Saturday as victor in the presidential race, according to NBC News Decision Desk projections.

With Election Day stretching for five days with no outcome, Americans — and markets — had been anxiously awaiting to find out whether Biden or President Donald Trump would win. Biden became president-elect Saturday after winning the pivotal state of Pennsylvania. NBC News called the race in Pennsylvania for Biden at 11:24 a.m. ET, bringing Biden's Electoral College vote total to 273 and allowing the network to call the election for him.

Trump has refused to concede, vowing to press forward with a legal fight and pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud.

Investors have already begun to reposition their portfolios to reflect the potential reality of a divided government, with no ""blue wave"" that would have put Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress.

With legislative power likely to be more balanced, traders wagered that restrictive measures, such as tighter regulation and higher taxes, would be unlikely to pass."

Tam, a first-time candidate, took 63 percent of the vote against Nicholas Ochs.

“It feels really good to know that someone who is openly LGBT can win,” Tam told NBC Asian America. “There was a time when people like me could not win. I’m glad that I can bring that representation to the capital.”

Tam described what was a nerve-wracking election season, from trying to connect with voters amid coronavirus, to narrowly taking down longtime incumbent Tom Brower in the August Democratic primary, to facing an overwhelming amount of hate from Ochs and his supporters in the general election.

“It’s almost to a harassment level,” Tam said, noting that Ochs' supporters bombarded his campaign’s social media to the point where the messages from his own voters were drowned out.

Ochs told NBC News he also faced harassing messages from Tam's supporters and that he was disappointed the two didn't get a chance to debate. He said that he is not racist.

Ochs’ campaign page was removed by Facebook in September for posts that violated the platform’s terms of service and community standards, local station KITV reported. He has been criticized in the past for offensive posts toward Black, Jewish and LGBT communities. Facebook did not respond to NBC News' request for comment.

Tam said part of his job now is to serve even those who directed hate toward him and his allies.

“I wanted our community to come together,” he said. “I wanted to let everyone know that I’m a public servant that will work with everyone. My office door will always be open to them and their families.”

Tam's agenda includes recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, strengthening the nontourism economy and improving resources for the homeless. Hawaii has the third-highest rate of homelessness in the country, according to a 2019 study, and Tam says the problem is especially prevalent in his district.

Brower, who assumed office in 2006, once smashed the belongings of homeless people in the district.

“We needed new leadership,” Tam said. “It was time for change, and I wanted to step up to the plate.”

Annise Parker, president of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a political action committee that supports LGBTQ people running for office, said that when there are no LGBTQ elected officials in a state, ""it has consequences, both in policy and how young LGBTQ people view themselves.”

“Adrian will ensure LGBTQ people are considered and prioritized in the state capitol and will inspire more LGBTQ people to run and serve,"" Parker said in a statement.

Tam reflected on the record number of LGBTQ and people of color elected to local and national government across the U.S.

“I’m glad that our Congress is slowly coming together and starting to look like the population of America,” he said."

She told the young man, one of 7 million conducting China’s once-in-a-decade census, that she and her girlfriend lived together.

Where the questionnaire asked for “relationship to head of household,” the man ticked the box for “other” and wrote “couple.”

The interaction with the receptive census taker was affirming, Lauren told Reuters, even if the handwritten note may not be reflected in the final results. Lauren asked to be identified by only her first name due to the sensitive nature of LGBTQ issues in China.

China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, but activists are still fighting for the legalization of same-sex marriage.

As the world’s most populous country attempts to capture demographic shifts, some LGBTQ couples are seeking recognition in the national census.

The information collection officially began on Nov. 1, with preliminary surveys underway in the weeks prior.

The National Bureau of Statistics told Reuters that any additional information beyond the predefined responses for the “relationship to head of household” category would not be recorded.

Shortly after that mid-October census visit, Lauren saw on her social feed posters urging same-sex couples to tell census takers: “They are not my roommate, they are my partner.”

Peng Yanzi, director of LGBT Rights Advocacy China, the NGO behind the campaign, said he hopes same-sex couples can gain visibility in the eyes of their neighbors and the government alike.

“These census takers may have never met, or even heard of, gay people, so if we have the opportunity to talk to them, they can better understand the LGBT community,” he said.

“We are a part of China’s population.”

While it remains difficult to come out in China, where many LGBTQ people refer to their romantic partners as roommates or friends, activists say there is a growing acceptance of gay couples.

“But the system hasn’t kept up with the times,” Peng said.

Lauren, who works at a tech company in Shanghai, said she felt comfortable speaking honestly about her relationship, but fears it may not be as safe for LGBTQ couples in more conservative areas to do so.

“I still wouldn’t dare,” one user of the Twitter-like Weibo commented on a post about the campaign.

In New York, Democrats Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones won their House races and became the first two gay Black candidates elected to Congress.

Jones told NBC News he is excited about serving alongside Torres.

“He’s a tremendous candidate and a good friend,"" he said. ""This is a chance for us to be the role model we looked for growing up — for queer youth and especially queer youth of color.”

Torres, a Bronx native who identifies as Afro Latinx, is also the first LGBTQ congressperson from New York City.

“Most would have thought New York City’s first LGBTQ member of Congress would be from Chelsea or Greenwich Village or Hell’s Kitchen, but the Bronx beat them to it,” said Annise Parker, president of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which works to elect openly LGBTQ candidates at all levels of government.

The elections of Torres and Jones ""shattered a rainbow ceiling,” Parker said, adding that they will bring new and vital perspectives to Congress.

""As our nation grapples with racism, police brutality and a pandemic that disproportionately affects people of color and LGBTQ people, these are the voices that can pull us from the brink and toward a more united and fair society,” she said.

With the addition of the two New Yorkers, the next session of Congress will likely include 11 openly LGBTQ members — nine House representatives and two senators — the most in U.S. history.

Six of the seven LGBTQ incumbents on the ballot, all Democrats, won re-election: David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Angie Craig of Minnesota, Mark Takano of California and Sharice Davids of Kansas, who became first openly gay Native American in Congress in 2018. The seventh incumbent, Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, is leading his Republican opponent by nearly 3 percentage points with 78 percent of votes in.

Davids, the lone Democrat in Kansas’ congressional delegation, defeated former state Republican Party chair Amanda Adkins, 53 percent to 44 percent.

In her acceptance speech late Tuesday night, Davids thanked voters for turning out in record numbers.

“Even in the face of this pandemic, American democracy moves ahead,” she said, adding that Kansans “spoke loud and clear — they rejected the tired politics of the past. … They chose a different vision for who we send to the United State House, making sure that we continue this path that we started.”

Cicilline, who introduced the Equality Act in 2019, defeated independent Frederick Wysocki by more than 50 percentage points.

“After four long years of turmoil and strife, Rhode Islanders are ready to bring our country together and heal the wounds that Donald Trump has opened,” Cicilline, 59, said in a statement.

There were more than two dozen LGBTQ congressional candidates on the ballot Tuesday, according to the Victory Fund. While only two nonincumbents won their races, Gina Ortiz Jones, an out lesbian and former Air Force captain, lost her race in Texas' 23rd Congressional District by just 3 points to Republican Tony Gonzalez.

Jones, 39, an Iraq War veteran, would have been the first openly gay representative from Texas and the first Filipino American woman in Congress. Two years ago, Jones lost to Republican incumbent Will Hurd by less than 1,000 votes.

The two LGBTQ senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, were not up for re-election.

In 2013, Baldwin, a lesbian, became the first LGBTQ senator in U.S. history. She was joined in the Senate by Sinema, who is bisexual, in 2019.

Baldwin, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, was also the first gay nonincumbent elected to either chamber of Congress. Prior, a handful of representatives — including Barney Frank and Gerry Studds of Massachusetts and Robert Bauman of Maryland — either came out while serving or after leaving Congress.

McGuffey, 63, made headlines in the primary where she challenged the incumbent, Jim Neil, who fired her from the sheriff’s department three years ago.

Neil insists he terminated McGuffey for creating a hostile work environment.

In a pending lawsuit against the department she will soon lead, McGuffey says she was the one subjected to a toxic workplace.

She maintains it was because she spoke out against excessive force — and because she is an openly gay woman.

Born and raised in Cincinnati, McGuffey said she knew she wanted to be a police officer by the time she was 14. But when she enrolled at the University of Cincinnati in the late 1970s, women weren’t allowed to be uniformed patrol officers.

That changed by the time McGuffey graduated, and she joined the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office in 1983. Rising through the ranks, she received glowing reviews and numerous accolades over more than three decades of service.

In 2013, McGuffey was promoted to major in command of jail and court services, making her the highest-ranking woman in department history. Under her watch, the Hamilton County Justice Center moved from being Ohio’s worst-ranked large jail to its best in only three years, according to audits by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Corrections.

In 2014, McGuffey was named regional Law Enforcement Officer of the Year, according to her bio, and two years later, the Ohio Chapter of the National Social Workers honored her as Citizen of the Year.

But even during her rise, McGuffey said, she felt singled out in “one of the harshest male-dominated environments you can imagine.”

When she spoke up about the mistreatment of inmates, “I was told to sit down and be quiet,” she told LGBTQ Nation. “I was the major of that jail, so my name’s on that if you guys are going to shove the use of force under the rug …”

Her gender and her sexual orientation were also issues, she said.

In one alleged incident, a staffer waved a Trump hat at McGuffey while she was attempting to lead a meeting.

“Everybody burst out laughing,” she told LGBTQ Nation. “It made me feel targeted, made me feel alone. I didn’t like it, but I was getting things done, and I just continued to work.”

After a deputy filed an official complaint alleging she screamed at and belittled subordinates, Neil launched an internal investigation.

The chief investigator determined McGuffey “used her position to retaliate against employees, as well as engaged in favoritism,” according to department records.

To McGuffey, though, the real goal of the investigation was to discredit her.

After more than 30 years, Neil demoted her to a lower-paying civilian job, according to McGuffey’s lawsuit. She refused the lesser role and was fired by the same man who promoted her to head the Hamilton County jail.

She filed a discrimination suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018. In February of this year, a district court advanced her case to trial, ruling that similar investigations of male, heterosexual officers had resulted in much lesser penalties, or none at all.

It wasn’t the first time McGuffey faced disciplinary action, though. In April 2010, she was brought up on criminal charges stemming from a confrontation with police outside a gay bar in Covington, Kentucky.

McGuffey had been watching a college basketball game with some friends. When the group left around 11 p.m., they were confronted by two patrolmen.

According to her, one of them threatened to arrest her friend for leaving the bar with a beer.

The officers maintained they only asked the friend to discard her beverage, which she did. But, according to a departmental report obtained by the Cincinnati Enquirer, which NBC News has not seen, McGuffey then became “loud and belligerent,” cursing and shouting that the male officers had “problems with gay women.” She was cited for public intoxication, menacing and disorderly conduct.

According to McGuffey, who denied she was acting menacingly, she and her friends were targeted because of their sexual orientation.

“They were horrible. When they found out I was a captain, it became this thing, like, ‘What are we going to do about her?’” she told NBC News. “They pushed me to the ground and handcuffed me. It was absolutely unlawful what they did, and they knew it.”

Ultimately, the charges, all misdemeanors, were dropped. But the sheriff’s office disciplined her for “conduct unbecoming” and suspended her for five days without pay.

Until then, McGuffey had been closeted at work.

“I was always terrified that the sheriff would find out and I would lose my job,” she said, alleging that the decision to discipline her was also fueled by homophobia.

“Being outed — it was such a harsh, awful experience,” she said. “But being able to be out? That was tremendous. As the highest ranking woman in the sheriff’s office, marching with my wife at Pride was one of the best days of my life.”

After being fired in 2017, McGuffey nursed her pride for a year and a half. Then she decided she could do Neil’s job better herself.

She declared her candidacy in May 2019, promising her election would mean “our country is moving forward.”

Endorsed by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and countless civil rights groups, McGuffey won the April Democratic primary against Neil handily with 70 percent of the vote.

Neil crossed party lines to endorse her general election opponent, Republican Bruce Hoffbauer. In an op-ed for the Cincinnati Enquirer declaring his support for Hoffbauer, Neil said McGuffey “would use the office of sheriff to be a political activist, pushing an anti-law enforcement agenda,” while he referred to Hoffbauer as a “tried and true law enforcement leader dedicated to public safety.”

On Tuesday, McGuffey defeated Hoffbauer 52 percent to 48 percent.

“I’ve lived here my whole life — people know me,” she said. “I have been out in the community in uniform, helping people. I’ve never strayed from those core values. It served me through his attacks.”

Neil declined NBC News’ request for comment.

Her victory isn’t just a vindication, she said. It represents hope. “Not just for the LGBTQ community, but for the Black and brown communities, for people of color. It means we can achieve.”

McGuffey will be the first LGBTQ sheriff in Hamilton County, as well as the first woman to serve in that role. And in a nation so divided, she said, that’s “a ray of sunshine through the clouds.”“I’ve been hearing from so many people, not just in Hamilton County, but across the nation. They’re glad to have some hope.”

When she takes office in January, she said her first priority will be making sure everyone she’s sworn to protect believes the justice system works for them.

“I know what it feels like to be targeted,” she said at a press conference Wednesday morning. “I know what it feels like to be the only woman in the room. I’ve seen a system that does not allow diversity in the upper echelons of law enforcement.”

And she wants to close the door on the divisiveness of the past.

“I’ve ordered a bunch of wood, because I plan on building a lot of bridges,” she said.

61,2020-11-07 22:24:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/how-black-voters-key-cities-helped-deliver-election-joe-biden-n1246980,How Black voters in key cities helped deliver the election for Joe Biden,"ATLANTA — In the way that one could on election night 2020, LaTosha Brown was making the rounds.

She was in a suite near the top of a luxury hotel so close to the airport that the balcony view overlooked a Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport airplane parking lot. Also there was Cliff Albright, who, with Brown, co-founded the voter mobilization organization Black Voters Matter.

After a Google Hangout with the field directors they had hired to register, engage and boost voter participation around the country, Brown sequestered herself in a bedroom, resting her body in a hotel chair, her tired feet — by then stripped to the socks — on the bed.

Between bites of food and watching election returns turn bits of the national map red or blue, Brown juggled calls, internet video sessions and texts, in each countering the conventional wisdom with journalists, political operatives and others that the election would come down to Donald Trump's mythical all-white suburbs filled with stay-at-home moms or Joe Biden's ability to convert them. Instead, it was decided in racially diverse urban centers and increasingly diverse suburbs in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia.

The Black people who make up 39 percent or more of the population in those areas chose Biden, with some exceptions. In fact, once the vote counts from Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee and Atlanta started to near completion, Trump's lead in their respective states disappeared. Biden — who would not have been the Democratic presidential nominee without Black voters in South Carolina — reached 270 Electoral College votes in large part because of Black voters in these cities.

But within minutes of starting an interview with the CBC/Radio-Canada, Brown ran headlong into the conventional and dismissive wisdom about American politics that conceives of white voters as more important or legitimate than Black and brown ones. It was the logic that perceives Black voters as an eternal problem rather than the solution.

""I would say that we have long participated at extraordinary levels and have to overcome extraordinary hurdles to do so,"" Brown said in that way a woman speaks when she aims to appear calm on the surface but is seething inside. The interviewer had dismissed the work of Brown, Albright, Georgia politician and organizer Stacey Abrams and many others who have registered and motivated voters for years, literally expanding the electorate and creating new swing states. In the interviewer's framing, Black Americans ""have historically low turnout,"" so was that work really wise?

Brown said: ""The fact that we have caught up with white voters, white women in particular, who have historically reaped all the benefits of voting and even any slight level of political engagement, who can't get pollsters and parties to stop targeting them, to me says that we are extraordinary. The fact that we have matched and topped white voter participation and done that while going through voter suppression in new and old forms every year, we are extraordinary. That's what I know.""

When the interview ended, Brown turned to say: ""She wasn't ready for that. The truth. Don't ask me why Black voter turnout is consistently low when nothing could be further than the clear and obvious truth.""

In the weeks before the election, about 63 percent of Black voters and 73 percent of white voters told Pew Research Center pollsters that they were ""extremely motivated to vote in the General Election."" About 54 percent of Latino and Asian voters said the same. In Georgia during the primary season, many voters, particularly Black voters, waited eight hours or more to participate. A surge in early and mail voting and other measures taken by Georgia's Republican secretary of state prevented a repeat on Election Day.

Picking presidents

If Brown's was the voice that may have reset the understanding of anyone watching BET or listening to CBC/Radio-Canada on election night, for others the truth about the election and how it was won arrived the next day in the poetic language of the Black church pulpit, when the Rev. Steve Bland Jr., pastor of Liberty Temple Baptist Church, spoke to MSNBC. He stood just outside Detroit's TCF Center, where Wayne County election officials tallied votes.

""As goes Detroit, will be done so ..."" said Bland, wearing a black baseball cap with the words ""Faith Over Fear."" ""We will determine the outcome, because we've gone from picking cotton to picking presidents.""

The accuracy of his assessment only grew clearer as Election Day stretched into Election Week.

Initial voting data and exit polls point to a few patterns: Record numbers of Americans cast ballots for each of the candidates, with many more Democrats exercising early and mail-in voting options than Republicans.

According to exit polls, Trump claimed about 18 percent of the vote among Black men and 8 percent among Black women, increases over his performance among both groups in 2016. But Biden held 87 percent of the Black vote, performing better among Black voters than any other demographic group.

And, much like almost every other Democrat since the 1960s, Biden won about 42 percent of the white vote.

Many white voters simply fled the Democratic Party after President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, with a bipartisan collective in Congress pushed through landmark equity-building legislation, and President Richard Nixon coalesced white Republican political support with his ""Southern strategy.""

While some Democrats, like centrist Bill Clinton, have been able to attract a few more white voters, members of the group have remained a sort of elusive, most-sought voter. But Black voters have consistently proven essential in determining election outcomes and, when Democrats fail, these often disregarded voters appear to top many lists of those who are blamed.

""Just as in 2016, the presidential race is being decided in states where the robust or anemic turnout of people of color will determine the outcome of the election,"" Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science and director of the James Weldon Johnson Institute at Emory University, said in a statement. ""In close elections, Democrats can maximize the advantage of strong minority support only when those voters turn out in strong enough numbers.""

Election cycle after election cycle, give or take a few points, about 90 percent of Black voters back Democrats, said Gillespie, who studies Black political behavior. About two-thirds of Latino and Asian American voters also vote for Democrats. But that strong Democratic advantage is less important if these groups do not show up to vote in high numbers.

For Cheetara Alexander, 34, the sense that this election, this presidential contest, was deeply consequential grew all year.

As a professional violence interrupter, Alexander works to prevent gun violence and murder in some of the Atlanta region's most dangerous and underserved communities. It is the kind of work often overlooked when questions of police misconduct are met with calls for Black Americans to care about so-called Black-on-Black crime.

It is also work that made her particularly attuned to the tolls that unchecked police brutality and the pandemic have exacted on Black Americans. Alexander said the political, policy and rhetorical failures of the White House have been so intense this year that she abandoned her usual plan to vote early. She decided to vote on Election Day.

Cheetara Alexander, 34, is the last to cast her vote at Barack Obama Elementary School in DeKalb County, Ga. Janell Ross / NBC

""There is just too much, too much going on that need not be, too much not happening that should be, to sit this out or even avoid what I had assumed would be crowds on Election Day,"" Alexander said.

After a long day of work, Alexander arrived at the door of her polling site in DeKalb County, which includes about 10 percent of the city of Atlanta. It was 7:01 p.m. Poll workers there told her they had to close at 7 sharp. She could drive to another DeKalb polling site at Barack Obama Magnet Elementary School of Technology and cast a provisional ballot until 7:45 p.m.

The polling site at Obama Elementary, already serving two precincts because its multicolor cafeteria and assembly spaces could allow for social distancing, was ordered to remain open until 7:45 p.m. on Election Day because of earlier technical issues that were confirmed to NBC News by two poll workers and an election monitor, a white man in a mask bearing the words ""SPEAK LIFE."" The extended time meant Alexander got to cast her vote in person, one of the last in metro Atlanta.

When she began to exit at 7:43 p.m., a poll worker offered to snap her picture with Obama's portrait, which hangs, at all times, on the school's front office wall. The former president had done a last swing through Atlanta to motivate Black voters the previous day.

""I didn't plan to be the last vote, but if this Black woman in Georgia winds up being the one that gives that man in the White House his walking papers, that will be just,"" Alexander said, pantomiming a chef's kiss.

As Alexander spoke, a Black man with a bald head and a gray beard who declined to give his name overheard the conversation and said to no one in particular, ""I claim that in the name of the ancestors and the late, great John Lewis.""

Lewis, a longtime member of Congress from Georgia and civil rights activist who was nearly killed in the push for Black voting rights, died in July. Trump, unlike many other Republican and Democratic government officials, declined to attend memorial services for Lewis, describing him as ""not impressive"" and saying, ""Nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have.""

While many Republicans and Democrats praised Lewis at his death and expressed reverence for his life's work, Republicans in the Senate — including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — have continued to block efforts to restore the intent of elements of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court invalidated in 2013. Now, part of Lewis' district, an Atlanta area that Trump described as ""in horrible shape and falling apart,"" may have delivered key votes to swing Georgia into Biden's column, although NBC News has not called the state for either candidate yet, due to the closeness of the race.

In the days after the election, election officials in the key states of Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina made it clear. The election would, indeed, come down to cities with large Black voter bases and even, possibly, provisional ballots like Alexander's.

But for every Alexander, there are also Black voters disillusioned by American politics.

Brian Keith, 43, a truck driver, is registered to vote in North Carolina. He is in a long-distance relationship with a Black woman who lives and votes in Georgia. That is not the only difference between them.

In the hour before the polls closed at Obama Elementary, he stood in a hallway waiting for his girlfriend to cast her vote. She planned to vote for Biden, Keith said. He skipped the top of the ticket on his own North Carolina ballot and participated in elections for state office on down.

""To me, when people can, one way or another, pump a million dollars into a race, that's just legalized bribery, and so the election becomes a sham,"" Keith said about congressional and presidential races. ""Those folks, whoever wins, are bought and paid for at that level.""

Keith described himself as someone who was often offended by things Trump said but who also agrees with some of his ideas and demands. But because of the way national politics has been riddled with donations from wealthy donors and lobbyists, he would not back Trump, either.

""I don't believe either of the parties, either of the candidates,"" Keith said. ""Honestly, if I had my choice, I would coup the federal government, because nobody really helps us, not the average person, not the average Black person, for sure.""

The years of organizing led to this moment

Pushing back against narratives like Keith's was the work that organizations like Black Voters Matter took on, years before the 2020 election. Brown and Albright, Abrams and many other grassroots organizers have collectively registered tens of thousands and encouraged many more to vote, while also contending with the reality that Black voters, typically loyal Democratic voters, have a limited list of political and social rewards for their votes, Brown said.

Abrams, who formed the organization, Fair Fight, after narrowly losing her 2018 bid for Georgia governor, declined to comment this week. The organization battled various policies and practices that suppressed the Black vote in Georgia and other states and worked to register about 800,000 new voters since 2018, Abrams told Vogue in an interview published Thursday.

Expanding the electorate to include every eligible person and engaging Black voters is key to creating a more equitable and just country, she has said. Abrams, who lives and votes in Georgia, also insists that she lost her bid to become the country's first Black female governor after her opponent, Brian Kemp, then Georgia's secretary of state, disqualified an unusual number of Black voters. Kemp, a Republican, won the election by 54,723 votes, or 1.3 percent of all the ballots cast. Abrams never conceded the race. Instead, she said at the time, ""the law currently allows no further viable remedy.""

And Abrams made her feelings about the central role of what she describes as the new American electorate known on Twitter on Friday morning as the work of Georgia vote counters stood on the precipice of deciding the presidential election. The political groundwork she and others did in once-deep-red Georgia was on the verge of turning the state blue.

On election night — before the sweeping and definitive influence of Black voters had seeped into the space of the undeniable for even those uncomfortable with overt discussions of race in politics and those who have made a living decrying ""identity politics"" since 2016 — Brown had a few moments to reflect. As Brown and her assistant scanned Brown's digital calendar for her remaining election night obligations, Brown described what would come next.

""Having been through the Obama years, I think many of us have learned and are prepared now to demand and keep demanding some policies of significance to the Black community, should there be a Biden administration after tonight,"" she said. ""That, too, is real. That's just where we are.""

Actress Eva Longoria, who campaigned for Biden and emceed the Democratic National Convention earlier this year, shared a video showing her TV screen when Biden was declared president-elect. Her enthusiastic cheers can be heard in the background.

""Democracy won!!! USA USA USA,"" the actress, producer and philanthropist tweeted alongside the video.

NBA superstar LeBron James, who launched the More Than A Vote initiative to combat voter suppression, shared a popular meme depicting Biden as James blocking a play from Miami Heat player Andre Tyler Iguodala, who in the image is depicted as President Donald Trump.

The Los Angeles Lakers player also thanked Philadelphia residents for their pivotal role in the election.

""My Philly fam! FOE and more THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! Let’s celebrate! Responsibly still,"" James tweeted.

Singer Lizzo shared an emotional video on her Instagram page.

""There are a few times in this country when I'm hopeful. But I feel like every time I'm hopeful, it gets taken away from me... I think this is the end of a four-year term that felt like a thousand years,"" she said tearfully about the coming end to Trump's presidency. ""Whether you were blue or were red, that man didn't care about you.""

""It’s time to hold the people in charge accountable. It’s time for them to listen. And it’s time for actual change in our policies and practices,"" Lizzo wrote in her post alongside her video.

Kerry Washington, an actress, producer and director who also emceed the Democratic National Convention alongside Longoria, tweeted, ""The people have spoken! Thank you to everyone who used your vote and your voice to make history. PRESIDENT Joe Biden and VICE PRESIDENT Kamala Harris.""

Actor, director and producer Katie Cassidy, who has been outspoken in support of Biden, also paid tribute to the historic win of Kamala Harris, tweeting, ""THE FIRST FEMALE BLACK VP!!! The best news I've heard all year!!!! Let this show that being a good person will ALWAYS win.""

Biden will be sworn in as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20, and Harris will become the first female, first Black and first South Asian American vice president.

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who created the Netflix hit show, ""When They See Us,"" based on the Central Park Five case, reminded her followers of the time Trump called for the execution of Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam—who were later exonerated—for the rape of a woman in Central Park.

""Imagine the person who took out full-page ads to call for your execution being voted in as President of the United States. Now, imagine that person being fired in shame. Sending my love to Korey, Antron, Raymond, Kevin and Yusef. Enjoy this day, my brothers. #exonerated5,"" DuVernay tweeted.

The five men, who are now known as the Exonerated 5, responded to the tweet with ""#JUSTICE.""

Comedian Leslie Jones used a touch of humor to celebrate Biden's win.

""YASSSSSSS!! CONGRATS PRESIDENT BIDEN!!,"" she tweeted alongside a viral video that shows Biden as Captain America and various other Democrats as other Avengers characters defeating Trump.

Musician John Legend, who performed at one of Biden's last campaign events in Pennsylvania, took a more serious tone in his congratulations to the president-elect and Harris on their win.

""Thank you for choosing to serve your country during these challenging times,"" Legend tweeted."
63,2020-11-09 23:00:41+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-voted-biden-63-31-reality-more-complex-n1247171,"Asian Americans voted for Biden 63% to 31%, but the reality is more complex","Asian American voters heavily favored Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden over President Donald Trump, early exit polls indicate.

The NBC News Exit Poll of early and Election Day voters indicated that 63 percent of Asian American voters across the country voted for Biden. A minority of the group voted for Trump, at 31 percent. Janelle Wong, senior researcher at the data and policy nonprofit AAPI Data, said the results track with the behavior she has observed during the election cycle.

""Asian Americans have been distinct from the general U.S. public when it comes to progressive views on health care, the environment, gun control and a social safety net provided by the government,"" Wong said. ""These issue positions have propelled Asian Americans toward the Democratic presidential candidate for the past seven election cycles.""

In the NBC News Exit Poll, an estimated 440 Asian American voters were surveyed across 24 key states, as well as nationally, in options of English and Spanish. The breakdown is consistent with the margins among the group in previous years. Data from the 2016 election cycle indicate that in 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton got 65 percent of Asian American votes, while Trump got 27 percent.

Biden has had strong support from Asian Americans throughout the election cycle, Wong said. Surveys in California — the state with the highest Asian American and Pacific Islander population — indicate that 45 percent of Asian Americans found Biden most favorable in the primaries, even with candidates of Asian descent — including Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and Andrew Yang — contending early on in the race. Wong said that during this particular cycle, Biden invested more resources in targeted ads to Asian Americans than Democrats have in the past.

In October, the Biden campaign launched a get-out-the-vote effort targeting the electorate through local ethnic media in 16 key states, as well as nationally. In addition to a television spot titled ""Stand Together,"" which prominently featured Harris, who is of Indian descent, the campaign released digital, radio and print ads.

""Paid media is big and shows real commitment,"" Wong said.

While Biden performed well among Asian Americans, the data suggest that Trump didn't lose support with the group, either. Paul Ong, a research professor at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said he expected more movement away from Trump because of his use of xenophobic and discriminatory language to describe the pandemic, such as ""kung flu"" and ""China virus.""

Ong said that during the pandemic, anti-Asian sentiment across the country has contributed to both hate incidents as well as an unprecedented increase in Asian American unemployment and business closings.

A UCLA report revealed that 83 percent of the Asian American labor force with high school degrees or lower has filed unemployment insurance claims in California, compared to 37 percent of the rest of the state's labor force with the same level of education. In New York City, Asian Americans were found to have the highest surge in unemployment during the pandemic, according to a report released by the social services nonprofit Asian American Federation.

""What is surprising is that I would have expected a noticeable decline in the percentages given Trump's xenophobic and anti-immigrant rhetoric,"" he said.

Ong added that overall, the narrow election indicates that ""changes have only happened marginally, and not a massive shift.""

""Worse, the racialized political divide has hardened, and we face a difficult next four years,"" he said.

Many campaigns down ballot, however, didn't sufficiently reach out to Asian Americans, Wong said. Even Biden, who did make an effort to reach out to Asian Americans, focused most spending on the group only in the last six weeks of the election cycle, she said.

""This is typical and has been the case our whole lives. No one pays attention to Asian Americans until the weeks before an election,"" Wong said. ""Consistent, long-term investment could make a difference, but it's just not the way that campaigns operate. They focus on the next election, not long-term base building.""

When looking at the gender breakdown, the NBC News Exit Poll found that 66 percent of Asian American men voted for Biden and 25 percent voted for Trump. Asian American women, on the other hand, broke for Biden by a smaller margin, 60 percent to 39 percent.

Wong said higher support among Asian American women for Trump wasn't observed in any previous surveys. That includes the 2020 Asian American Voter Survey, which examined almost 1,570 voters, targeting the six largest national origin groups, and was conducted in English and four Asian languages — which concluded the opposite.

Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data, said there were a number of limitations to the NBC News Exit Poll, which may have produced an irregular result. Because it was conducted in English and Spanish, participants are likely to have skewed more U.S. born. Pew Research Center research on electorate shows that the majority are foreign-born naturalized citizens.

Survey participants of Asian descent were given the option of identifying only as ""Asian"" rather than by their specific ethnicities, and therefore the findings weren't weighted by detailed origin, potentially contributing to skewed results, Ramakrishnan added.

Ethnicities within Asian America have varying voting behaviors. For example, Vietnamese Americans historically lean more Republican, while Indian Americans tend to vote more for Democrats. So if the survey happened to include more Vietnamese American women and Indian American men, it would have produced an apparent gender difference that, in reality, is based on ethnicity, he said.

Ramakrishnan also noted that the survey was weighted to reflect the geographic spread of the overall electorate, rather than the spread of the Asian American community, potentially producing a geographic bias. Given those factors, he said, ""it is not meant to be representative of the Asian American population.""

That's not to say the poll doesn't have its utility. Wong said it's most useful for tracking changes over time, because its data collection on the group stretches to the 1992 election.

""I think we can learn some big picture long-term trends from looking at those exit polls over time,"" Wong said."

Dr. Robert Rodriguez is a California emergency room doctor who responded to a Covid-19 surge in his native Texas, and Dr. Luciana Borio is an expert in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases who left the Trump administration and warned the public in January of the coming Covid-19 crisis.

Rodriguez is a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California San Francisco. He has had a front-line view of the ravages of Covid-19 in Texas.

Borio, an infectious disease physician, served on President Donald Trump's National Security Council as a member of its pandemic response team until Trump disbanded it in 2018. She is vice president of technical staff at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit venture capital company that develops new technologies for national security agencies.

The board represents the first steps taken by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to begin the transition to a new administration and begin their approach to controlling the pandemic. The Biden-Harris team laid out Biden's plans to tackle the pandemic on its transition webpage.

Rodriguez: 'Sickest patients I had ever seen'

Rodriguez volunteered to return to his hometown, Brownsville, Texas, to help during a Covid-19 surge in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Rodriguez also has been dealing with Covid-19 cases in two hospitals in the San Francisco Bay area.

In an online panel held by the League of United Latin American Citizens in mid-August, Rodriguez said he had ""seen firsthand how the pandemic has devastated Latino communities.""

Cases in San Francisco were steady, but he said the work he did in Brownsville was ""the hardest experience of my life, the hardest work as an emergency physician, as an intensive care physician.""

""I flew down there, and the next day I was in the ICU treating the sickest patients that I had ever seen in my career. The doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists were working extremely hard, but they were simply overwhelmed with the number of cases,"" he said. ""At the time, we had about five times the number of cases in the ICU there as compared to my hospital [in San Francisco], which was a much bigger hospital and a much better resourced hospital.""

He called Covid-19 ""the medical crisis of our times.""

""We need to address this topic seriously, and we need leadership that will take it on and not minimize the pandemic,"" he said on the call, which included Jill Biden, who will be the next first lady.

Rodriguez has published many research reports, many that focus on health care in the Latino and the undocumented populations. He is the associate chair of research for the emergency medicine department at the UCSF School of Medicine.

Borio, who is from Brazil, is known for having spoken out when she became concerned about the virus's potential to spread in the U.S. and the lack of action from the Trump administration. On Jan. 28, The Wall Street Journal published an opinion article she co-wrote, titled ""Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic.""

""First, the most important public-health tool for containment is the identification and isolation of cases to break the chain of spread,"" the opinion piece said, urging easily accessible testing, more protective equipment and more infection control procedures.

Borio, a graduate of the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, was assistant commissioner for counterterrorism and emerging threats and acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama administration. She helped develop countermeasures and public health responses to the 2009-10 H1N1 flu pandemic, the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak and the 2015-16 Zika outbreak.

She practices medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital at Baltimore.

Castro, who made that a catchphrase of his primary campaign, relaunched T-shirts with the phrase as soon as Biden hit the magic electoral college votes number to become the projected president-elect on Saturday.

Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama/Biden administration, said repeatedly on the trail that he looked forward to the day when the traditional moment would come for the new president to usher out the old one.

He imagined it would be him with his wife and children, as any ambitious candidate would, and Marine One would be taking off and the nation would be saying, ""Adiós Trump.""

The proceeds from the sale of his T-shirts will go to helping young immigrants who are renewing their permission to remain in the country and work under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program — which President Donald Trump has tried to end.

Thanks to high stress levels and a brain that wouldn’t shut off, I was in search of a way to get a better night’s rest (without having to resort to drugs). I’m a serial tosser-and-turner, and it’s often difficult for me to fall — and stay — asleep because I’m constantly thinking about what I have to tackle on my to-do list the next day. It’s a vicious cycle that leaves me feeling completely drained in the morning.

SKIP AHEAD Other weighted blankets to consider

After weeks of seeing weighted blankets ads pop up in my social feeds, I decided to give the trend a try. Weighted blankets have seen a surge in popularity, with many proponents saying they have stress-, anxiety- and insomnia-relieving effects. The hype is palpable: Gravity Blanket racked up more than $4 million on its Kickstarter campaign in 2017, and according to Pinterest, saves for weighted blankets were up a whopping 259 percent in 2018.

So with Rocabi's 15-pound weighted blanket in hand (which is the size the brand recommends for people who are between 100-150 pounds) I got into bed, hopeful but nervous. I was worried that the blanket would be restrictive and too hot (disrupting my already patchy sleep), but I was able to turn onto my side pretty easily, and it didn’t cause me to overheat. (Now, I probably won’t use a weighted blanket on 90-degree nights, but it was totally fine on a 70-degree night.)

Because I couldn’t physically move as much, I noticed that my thoughts weren’t racing as much either.

When I slipped under the blanket, I felt like I was wrapped in a cocoon, as if the blanket were hugging me. (That feeling of being hugged is what Irina Zhdanova, MD, CEO of ClockCoach, told me was likely responsible for any calming effects.) Although it was possible for me to shift onto my side, the blanket was definitely more snug than my regular comforter, and I felt like it encouraged my body to stay still. Normally, I’m pretty restless in bed, and the act of moving around makes my mind wander. But, because I couldn’t physically move as much, I noticed that my thoughts weren’t racing as much either. I was able to just focus on the present, and that made it easier to fall asleep. I didn’t wake up once in the middle of the night, which is very rare for me and after 7 hours of solid sleep, I felt so refreshed that I didn’t even need to stop for my iced coffee on the way to office.

But is there really any concrete evidence to support my seemingly better sleep experience? Or was it all in my head?

How weighted blankets work: benefits and limitations

Weighted blankets are exactly what they sound like — they’re heavy blankets (typically 15 pounds or more) filled with a material such as plastic pellets. The theory is that the deep pressure you feel from being under all of that weight has a calming effect.

Heiser says the 15-pound blanket helped calm her racing thoughts and lulled her to sleep.

The deep pressure of the blanket makes you feel like you’re being hugged or swaddled, says Zhdanova. “Being hugged is a very powerful stimulus,” she says. “When you’re hugged, you feel more secure.” Plus, weighted blankets offer mild restraint, says Zhdanova — they make it harder for you to move and thus harder for you to disturb yourself while you sleep.

For a study published in the “Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,” participants undergoing wisdom tooth removal (which the researchers identified as one of the most stressful medical procedures) wore weighted blankets during their surgeries. Under the weighted blankets, the patients showed more activity in the part of the nervous system that is in control during times of low stress.

One of the most popular uses for weighted blankets is for treating children with disorders like autism and ADHD. “It’s absolutely true that some kids benefit from compression, either from weighted blankets or stretchy Lycra sleeping bags [which also provide deep pressure],” says Lynelle Schneeberg, board-certified sleep psychologist and director of the behavioral sleep program at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. A study published in “The American Journal of Occupational Therapy” found that elementary school aged students who wore weighted vests paid attention more and fidgeted less in class.

That being said, there are a few cons to weighted blankets, especially when it comes to having kids use them. They’re heavy, which makes them hard to travel with, they get hot, and it can prove difficult for children to use them on their own without parents there. “When parents ask me about weighted blankets, I ask if their child can put it on, arrange it and tuck themselves in,” says Dr. Schneeberg. She prefers Lycra sleeping bags for children because they’re lighter, more portable and easier to use.

How to pick the best weighted blanket for you

If you are going to try a weighted a blanket, keep in mind that they can get pricey. A 20-pound Gravity Blanket, for example, costs $189. (If you’re crafty, Schneeberg says you can DIY your own version — here’s a DIY weighted blanket tutorial.)

Committed to shelling out some cash? Zhdanova recommends sticking with a weighted blanket on the lighter side. Most experts advise choosing one that’s roughly 10 percent of your body weight — so if you’re 150 pounds, you should buy a 15-pound blanket. Zhdanova notes that you shouldn’t use a weighted blanket if you snore or have sleep apnea, because anything that is placed on your chest can disrupt your breathing even further.

But if stress, a mile-long to-do list and funneling caffeine to get through the day is the battle you're fighting, a weighted blanket may just help you put those sleepless nights behind you.

Other weighted blankets to consider

As the coronavirus continues to spread, many of us may be feeling increasingly anxious and stressed out. And with extra time at home, we may be looking for new ways to relax.

The previously mentioned Gravity Blanket is highly-rated and available in four sizes: 15, 20, 25 and 35 pounds. According to a 2019 sleep study, 72 percent of the participants using the Gravity Blanket reported more restful sleep and 76 percent said they were able to fall asleep faster. Aside from this Grey option, the blanket also comes in Navy and White.

The Casper Weighted Blanket is throw-sized, meaning you can use it in bed or take it with you to the couch. It features a polyester batting fill and inner liner, and a breathable cotton outer shell to keep you cool while you sleep. It also sports quilted channels to evenly distribute the microbead fill.

After collaborating with the gourmet ice-pop company The Hyppo, Bearaby recently launched its Napsicle collection, featuring three weighted blankets. Each blanket is comprised of multiple layers of hand-knit organic cotton, making them more sustainable than options that use plastic fillers to give them weight. Plus, they come in three ice-pop inspired colors: Mango Siesta, Watermelon Dreams, Blueberry Nights.

When Covid-19 hit corporate America back in March, I was one of the many workers scrambling to put together a comfortable home office. I missed my colleagues, the machine-brewed coffee and — never thought I’d say this — I missed my desk. More specifically, I missed something I used to sit on (no, not my ergonomic office chair): the Gaiam Wobble Disc I relied on to help my posture.

Keep up with our 2020 election coverage

Like most modern humans, I’m often tethered to my computer — in my case, a laptop — for the entire work day. I’ve also spent the entirety of my working years battling the effects of bad posture in the sedentary realities of a desk job. Yoga and strength exercises increasingly became a part of my daily routine to contend with that. At one point, I even printed out a sketch of a healthy spine and taped it to my computer monitor as a reminder to sit up straight. That’s around the time a friend recommended a strange-looking addition to my chair.

The Gaiam Balance Disc is an inflatable plastic device designed to rest on top of the seat of any chair. Its broad oval shape helps it fit snugly on your seat. It feels a lot like sitting on a balance ball at the gym, but the disc has a flat base, allowing it to enter your workstation. Because it wobbles underneath you while seated, the disc engages your core muscles and supports proper sitting posture. In turn, it’s built to offer physical relief from stagnant work postures that might lead to tight muscles and other health issues.

With relatively affordable risk, I jumped on the recommendation and spent just over $20 to add it to my regular chair set-up. What I love about it most is the built-in, subtle cuing to stop my slumping and sit up straight. When I lean too far to the left, whoops, I feel I lose balance and work to recenter. Crossing my legs? Not possible without slouching. If I fall into a general hunch, the Wobble Disc helps me notice it and make a correction. If anything, that’s one of the main values of the disc: It communicates to me silently that I’m in a bad spot.

Admittedly, the disc looks a little weird at first, as I mentioned above. It’s an addition to the top of your chair of a pillow-like structure with slight slope over the top, so not really what we expect from normal chairs. But its function made the form well worth it (and more than tolerable). Sitting on it during work — or wobbling, rather — did take some time getting used to, a few weeks, I’d say. The only real downside is the disc’s materials: plastic. It can make some goofy sounds if you move around on it in just the right way. It might not be noticeable in your home office, but definitely created an awkward moment or two when I was in an open office environment — I don’t think it’s a dealbreaker, though."

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

Editor's note: The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) notes some possible risks when using essential oils in proximity to pets. Before buying an oil diffuser, be sure it's safe for your pets and that you pet-proof the space where you plan to use it.

I didn’t realize what essential oils could do for me until the day I came across my sister working on her final project for school. She was sipping on coffee and listening to some calming playlist, and I spotted an oil diffuser beside her. Somehow, she seemed to be completely relaxed despite the stress of the moment: Back then, this included the onset of coronavirus and the college paper she was working on. I asked her about what smelled like Christmas to me. She explained it was coming from the BellaMist Essential Oil Diffuser, a tiny device used to break down essential oils and disperse them into the air — besides the model I came to adore, there are myriad options for oil diffusers at retailers like Wayfair, Walmart and Macy's.

After researching and learning how diffusers work, as well as which scents I could grab, I began to borrow my sister's diffuser throughout the day. Within a month, it had become a fundamental part of my routine. My sister is mostly happy to share her diffuser with me — but I’ll be buying my own once I get back to New York.

How I use the essential oil diffuser all day

The BellaMist diffuser is very simple to get going:

I pop off its orb-like cap and fill its body with water. Then I add a few drops of oil into that water. After replacing the cap and switching the diffuser on, it quickly produces steam and spreads it around.

The covering protects the heated water from bubbling over — and keeps me from accidentally touching the hot water. It also doubles as a light feature with a variety of colors I get to choose from. One of the options has the diffuser automatically rotate through its possible colors, adding a level of aesthetically pleasing entertainment to my relaxation.

The BellaMist Essential Oil Diffuser is compact and easy to use. It produces mist for up to four hours and comes with a 5ml bottle of peppermint essential oil to get you started. It also includes a light feature that offers seven different colors.

Essential oil diffusers need oil

Which oil you end up using is up to you and your routines. BellaMist offers a variety of essential and fragrance oils, both individually and in sets.

In the mornings and while I work, I like to use something that can wake me up and keep me alert. To that end, I rely on peppermint oils .

. Once I get tired of peppermint or enough time has passed, I’ll switch over to a fiery clove-and-spice scent — it gives me the feeling of entering a new environment.

— it gives me the feeling of entering a new environment. Later in the day or during the weekend, I love the smell of lavender to help me unwind and relax.

While I prefer the aromatherapy aspect of essential oils, registered dietician Maya Feller previously told TODAY that they're generally used in three ways: They can be ingested through droppers or capsules, applied to skin topically through hair or skin care products and spread into air for aromatherapy with a diffuser. Feller uses essential oils in her practice, scents including oregano, lemon, peppermint, lavender, and argan oil.

Regardless of which route you head, keep in mind the ASPCA notes some possible risks when using essential oils in proximity to pets. ""Using an oil diffuser for a short time period in a secured area — one that your dog or cat cannot access — is not likely to be an issue,"" they summarize. ""However, if your pet has a history of breathing problems, it may be best to avoid using one altogether."" Before buying an oil diffuser, be sure it's safe for your pets and that you pet-proof the space where you plan to use it.

Although the BellaMist Diffuser is what I currently use daily, TODAY contributor Katie Jackson recommends the Urpower Diffuser. It has over 33,000 reviews on Amazon, and goes for less than $20. She explains that the small-but-mighty diffuser freshens up the air and is easy to use.

Today is Earth Day, marking the 50th annual Earth Day since 1970. It may be more difficult to embrace this milestone as stay-at-home orders are limiting people’s outdoor exposure. But despite obstacles to rally for climate change, it’s still possible to find small ways to minimize environmental impact at home — in your kitchen, bathroom or bedroom, for example.

I’m no climate change super activist, but I do my best to incorporate eco-friendly products like reusable straws and recycled bags into my daily routine. Until recently, those were really the only steps I took toward living an eco-minded life. Thanks to curated shopping ads on my social feeds — where I spend a significant part of my professional time researching content — I learned that being climate-conscious was becoming extremely popular in the world of fashion. It was Instagram that kept introducing me to Rothy’s and its line of sustainable footwear. I wasn’t even on the hunt for an eco-friendly shoe. I was seeking style and comfort. But Rothy’s checked off both of those boxes, and invested in reducing its environmental impact: That’s what led me to buy one of their bestsellers — The Flat.

Why I fell in love with Rothy’s shoes

The Rothy’s Flat is unlike any shoe I’ve worn before. I bought a pair thinking they would be a good shoe for work since they looked polished and versatile. What I didn’t realize is that they were also comfortable enough to wear around the city — and I’m a person who likes to explore on foot. They required little break-in time, too — a major plus since most of my shoes involve a two-week blister period.

Living in New York City also presents its challenges for any typical shoe lover (myself included). Whether I misstep into a puddle or drop food when someone cuts me off on a sidewalk, it doesn’t take long for my shoes to experience some wear. Even after donning my Rothy’s flats for weeks, they held their shape and the material didn’t show any signs of fading or tearing. If you spill your coffee on the shoes, it will certainly leave a mark, but the shoes are machine washable.

My Rothy’s Flats don’t have flashy embellishments or a recognizable logo. What they do have is a timeless silhouette that goes with everything from jeans to dresses — office-appropriate or not. I found myself wearing them often enough that I purchased another pair, this time in The Point.

Rothy’s Flat, the specs

It's more than style that keeps Rothy's shoes dear to my heart.

The insoles and outsoles of the shoes are machine washable . Since they’re made with up-cycled materials, they're less likely to shrink.

. Since they’re made with up-cycled materials, they're less likely to shrink. The shoes are created using a 3D knitting machine . This greatly reduces how much waste is created with each new pair.

. This greatly reduces how much waste is created with each new pair. Plastic bottles can take up to 450 years to decompose. Since Rothy’s spins plastic bottles into thread, they say their shoes gain significant durability

You can get shoes in 11 different colors and patterns — from a versatile navy to a bold leopard print.

Why I fell in love with Rothy’s, the brand

In 2016, Rothy’s launched its first shoe. The company went through four years of research and development before their first product showcased, according to a spokesperson. They didn’t gain traction until two years later when, in 2018, Meghan Markle publicly wore The Point shoes and introduced the brand to the masses, according to Forbes.

Rothy’s shoes are made of water bottles

Instead of using cotton, polyester or rubber-based materials, Rothy's creates their shoes and bags from a unique thread spun from water bottles they collect from oceans across the globe. To create the signature thread, Rothy's puts the plastic bottles through a three-step process:

A machine chips the collected water bottles into flakes. Pressure is used to press the flakes into small pellets. Using a 3D knitting process — a machine transforms the pellets into spools of thread, which are in turn dyed and knitted into footwear and bags.

Currently, Rothy's estimates it hasrecycled more than 53,614,900 water bottles to use in their products.

Rothy's aims to be a 'zero waste' company

Through the process of 3D knitting, the brand is able to create their products with little-to-no waste, the company claims. Rothy's programs its equipment to craft the exact shape of the shoe without needing to cut or rid of any material.

Rothy's packages are sustainable, too

The boxes used to ship their products are made from 85 percent post-consumer recycled materials. They’re also vegan and biodegradable. Their durable material allows them to avoid additional packaging, the brand says.

Other styles from Rothy's

The Flat continues to be one of the bestselling items on the site — and still my favorite. Once it’s time to do so, I’ll definitely be adding more of the Flat to my collection. If you’re on the lookout for a practical shoe that is eco-friendly and designed to stand the test of time, you may want to consider some of Rothy’s additional styles, including their brand new sandal collection. I own The Sneaker and The Chelsea Boot in addition to the original pointed-toe flat — if you’re in need of a good walking shoe, these may be good options. Each style is offered in a variety of colors and patterns so you can easily change up your look.

In March, the brand introduced a collection of bags created from the same material as their shoes.

This modern, pointed flat can be dressed up or down. They have no break-in period so you can start wearing them immediately with little discomfort.

The Loafer is great for lounging, taking the dog for a walk or doing chores around the home. It comes in solid colors as well as unique patterns.

The polished bow on The Mary Jane is an upgrade to the original Point shoe.

The Sneaker is a great go-to shoe because it can be worn year-round. It showcases an ivory outsole and comes in eight versatile colors.

If you’re looking for a shoe with more coverage and support, the Chelsea Boot may be a good option. It's crafted with a stitch-less design that eliminates uncomfortable seams.

The Knot comes in four colors and is finished with a light brown, vegan outsole.

This warm-weather shoe features a soft footbed made with plant-based materials.

The Handbag is the brand’s signature bag. It sports a top handle and a detachable strap so you can wear it multiple ways.

The Essential Tote features a zipper closure and a base insert for structure. It also has an interior magnet to easily attach The Essential Pouch.

I always try to keep a watch on my wrist for easy access to the time as even the best smartphone begs to be pulled from a pocket before it will confirm the date. And while I’m inching ever closer to investing in an Apple Watch — a steep climb given my ongoing loyalty to the Pixel 4 — I’ve yet to find a wristwatch as all-around perfect and useful for me as the Casio F91W Digital Sport Watch. My father sported it in yellowing photos I’ve come across and I distinctly remember him sporting the metal model, which equips Electro Luminescence. Regardless, the point is that the watch stands the test of time. As far as I’m concerned, everyone should have one of these $13 watches tucked into a drawer or glove compartment, just in case.

I first got one of these a few years out of high school, strapped for cash and grabbing bargain tech to get me through. A watch that ran me about $10 back then (and just a few dollars more in the years since) became one of the most long-lasting, functional and efficient devices I’ve ever had. And I think it’s presented similar value to others:

I’ve personally bought this watch four times (maybe five) in the last decade, rebuying it to replace the last one I’d lost during a move or under a bed (just once). Sure, something this simple isn’t for everyone. But its biggest value, in my opinion, is specifically everything it doesn’t try to do or be. The Casio sport watch tells me the time, repeatedly, no matter what I’m up to: running, working, swimming, walking, hiking, beaching, biking and so on — it doesn’t do much more than that, though. This watch plants itself solidly in a bed of mediocrity and, in that space, it carries itself with the utmost confidence. That’s the kind of watch I’d want to have strapping me during an apocalypse — or pandemic.

The Casio wristwatch is water-resistant so you don’t have to take it off for a shower, nor when you hit the pool or beach. It’s also virtually invincible — I’ve accidentally smashed it and dropped it but it has never broken or gone silent — it will scratch, like any other device will, but it won’t complain about it. The display is clean, simple and informative:

You get the time, which you can format to a 24-hour output, a must for me in any timekeeping device

You can set alarms

You can start a stopwatch

And you can use its backlight for nighttime timetelling — and I mean an actual light, a bulb in the back corner of the display that faintly spreads it glow across the digits, lighting them up just enough so you tell the time in pitch darkness.

But all of that aside, we have to talk about its style because a watch is as much an accessory as it is jewelry. And in that space, the Casio watch achieves a wonderful compromise between ancient tech (from the 20th century) and the modern aesthetic: It’s cool. You get the essential functions of a watch that isn’t one bit smart (well, the alarm is quite punctual) with a style that fits 80s nostalgia as much as it fits modern (though distant) boardrooms, where minimalism and aloofness dominate. Of course, if you wanted to get the value of a Casio-built watch and crank up the styling, you’ve got plenty of options.

The backlit display of this Casio watch gives you a greenish glow across its back, so the digits get especially easy to read at night. Otherwise, it sports lots of the same functions and amenities as Casio’s other baseline watches.

Maybe you’re more active or want to strap that fitness-first aesthetic onto your wrist. Either way, the iconic G-Shock line from Casio is still a relatively affordable upgrade to consider.

Finally, perhaps you’re way too advanced for digital watches and rather lean on the analog display of the truly timeless. This simple Casio watch will run you the same as the sport watch and likely fits better with a nice going-out suit than the former.

71,2020-11-09 16:06:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/jupiter-s-moon-europa-glows-dark-scientists-say-n1247105,"Jupiter's moon Europa glows in the dark, scientists say","Intense radiation from the giant planet Jupiter causes the night side of its moon Europa to visibly glow in the dark – a phenomenon that could help scientists learn if it can sustain simple forms of life, according to a new study.

The findings, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, were the result of experiments by NASA scientists to study how Jupiter’s radiation affects the chemistry of Europa, which is thought to harbor a subsurface ocean of water.

And though telescopes haven’t yet observed the glow, the possibility that Europa glows in the dark could be verified by two probes that will study the moon in the coming years.

The researchers built a below-freezing “ice chamber” at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to contain the chemicals thought to be on Europa’s icy surface and exposed it to a beam of high-energy electrons to simulate the radiation from Jupiter.

“We saw that whenever we shot it with the electron beam, it glowed,” Murthy Gudipati, an astrophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the lead author of thestudy, said. “And when the electrons were switched off, the glow went off.”

The radiation that hits Europa is caused by Jupiter’s vast magnetosphere – the most powerful magnetic field anywhere in the solar system apart from the sun. It’s thought to be generated by metallic hydrogen in the giant planet’s highly-pressurized core.

Jupiter’s magnetosphere forms an invisible flat disk up to 12 million miles wide – much larger than the roughly million-mile wide orbit of Europa. Its radiation would kill a human being on Europa’s surface in a few seconds.

Because the simulated radiation in the experiments is also intense, the researchers studied its interactions remotely with cameras, according to Gudipati.

As well as seeing evidence of key chemical and physical changes in Europa’s crust, Jupiter’s radiation breaks water ice into oxygen and hydrogen, boosting the chances that oxygen filters down to the liquid ocean below – the researchers observed the ice visibly glowed.

The scientists then changed the chemicals thought to be mixed with ice on Europa’s surface – such as the “table salt” sodium chloride and the “Epsom salt” magnesium sulfate – and discovered differently salted ice glows with different intensities and sometimes different colors: greenish, bluish or white.

It was a moment of serendipity, Gudipati said.

“We realized that this ice glow can be controlled by what kind of material is there,"" he said.

Calculations indicate Europa’s glow would look like the light from a full moon on a beach on Earth, he said.

That means it could be bright enough to be detected on the night side of the moon by nearby spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper probe expected to arrive there before the end of this decade, and that its measurements could distinguish surface areas with different chemistries, Gudipati said.

Europa Clipper project scientist Bob Pappalardo, a planetary geologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the probe’s main purpose will be to confirm Europa’s subsurface ocean and assess the chances that microbes could live there.

Only fossils are expected to remain of any life that evolved on Mars or Venus billions of years ago, he said. And while other gas-giant moons, such as Saturn’s Enceladus, are also thought to have subsurface water, they don’t have the intense radiation thought to create the necessary chemicals for life in Europa’s ocean.

But the radiation that makes life more likely on Europa could also harm Europa Clipper, which means the probe will only dive close enough – between 15 and 60 miles above its surface – for brief periods and spend most of its orbit much further away.

“We call it a toe-dip,” Pappalardo said. “It’s like running down and sticking your toe in the water, and then running away because it’s cold.”

Planetary scientist Andrew Coates at University College London, who has worked on several space probes, said he thinks Europa’s glow might also be visible to the European Space Agency’s JUICE mission – Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer – which is due to arrive in 2029.

“The spectrum of the glow would give more clues about the subsurface ocean,” he said in an email."

""All remaining mink will now be culled including non-infected and otherwise healthy mink,"" Denmark's Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said in a press conference.

""We would rather go a step too far than take a step too little to combat Covid-19,"" he said, adding that the Scandinavian country had not overreacted nor taken the decision lightly.

As of Thursday, 216 mink farms in the country were infected with coronavirus and all remaining minks would be culled in line with animal welfare guidelines in the coming weeks, Danish health officials said. Denmark has a total of around 300 mink farms, according to officials.

Earlier, the WHO said it was monitoring the mutation, which was a ""concern,"" but that it was too early to tell if it posed any risk to humans or would undo the impact of a potential vaccine.

""This is a global pandemic and many millions of people have been infected, many millions of animals have been exposed,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said during a virtual press conference from Geneva.

""Right now, the evidence that we have doesn't suggest that this variant is in any way different in the way it behaves ... it is still the same virus.""

On Thursday, Denmark announced strict new lockdown measures in its northern counties, home to most mink farms, after authorities discovered the mutated strain in the region.

The government said it would cull all minks — up to 17 million — to prevent human contagion with the mutated coronavirus, which health authorities said could be more resistant to future vaccines.

Tyra Krause, a senior public health specialist at Denmark's State Serum Institute, the authority that identified the mutated strain, said although more research was needed, early lab results found ""this variant showed less sensitivity"" to antibodies, which could make a potential vaccine ""less effective.""

Krause also predicted ""an increase in the coming weeks"" in the number of infected patients with the mutated strain, which currently stands at 12 people, she said.

In a report published Wednesday, the institute said tests showed the new strain had mutations on its so-called spike protein, which invades and infects healthy cells. That poses a risk to future Covid-19 vaccines, which are based on disabling the spike protein, it said.

The WHO's Ryan said although mammal species like mink were ""very good hosts,"" health officials were still a ""long, long way away"" from any determination on the mutation's impact on a vaccine.

The global public health body would also be looking at biosecurity in other countries that farm mink to ""prevent spillover events,"" Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said on Friday, adding that the risk from other farm animals and livestock was generally low.

""Mutations are normal,"" van Kerkhove said. ""These types of changes in the virus are something we've been tracking since the beginning.""

In the United States, nearly 10,000 minks at nine fur farms in Utah died of Covid-19, state veterinarian Dean Taylor told NBC News last month.

The deaths forced the affected farms to quarantine as the outbreaks were investigated.

That exoplanet is called K2-141b and was originally discovered in 2017. The world is about half again as big as Earth but orbits so close to its star, which is one class smaller than our own, that it completes several loops each Earth-day with the same surface permanently facing the star. Now, scientists predict those factors mean that two-thirds of the surface of K2-141b is permanently sunlit — so much so that not only is part of the world covered in a lava ocean, but some of that rock may even evaporate away into the atmosphere.

""All rocky planets­, including Earth, started off as molten worlds but then rapidly cooled and solidified,"" Nicolas Cowan, a planetary scientist at McGill University in Canada and a coauthor on the new paper, said in a statement. ""Lava planets give us a rare glimpse at this stage of planetary evolution.""

The scientists behind the new researchers wanted to understand what sort of atmosphere such a hot world might have and how terrestrial tools would see it. K2-141b was a tempting target because it's been studied by both the K2 mission of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope and by the agency's Spitzer Space Telescope. And the atmosphere is particularly intriguing because scientists believe that NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch late next year, will be able to analyze the components of distant planetary atmospheres.

The researchers started with what previous studies have determined about K2-141b so far — for example, that the planet's density is about that of Earth's, so the crust can be modeled as pure silica as a reasonably simplified representation. Then, the scientists figured out what the surface might look like. That work took into account complications like the fact that the planet is so close to its star that more than half the world's surface might be sunlit, perhaps as much as two-thirds, the researchers calculated.

Such constant light and heat mean that the world likely sports a magma ocean tens of miles or kilometers deep, according to the team's calculations. Then, the researchers modeled what an atmosphere here would look like based on three potential main ingredients, all of which are common in the crusts of rocky planets.

All three cases can support an atmosphere, the scientists calculated, with wind speeds above 1.1 miles (1.75 kilometers) per second, far faster than the speed of sound here on Earth.

At the edges of the atmosphere, where temperatures drop, the gaseous rock would cool enough to fall back to the surface as precipitation, the researchers calculated. If the atmosphere is dominated by silica or silicon monoxide, that precipitation would mostly fall into the magma ocean, but if the atmosphere is predominantly sodium, the planet would look even weirder, with solid sodium oozing back toward the oceans like glaciers here on Earth, the researchers wrote.

But all this modeling wasn't just to envision what a truly bizarre world might look like; this is science, after all. The researchers wanted to compare their models with the current and predicted observing capacities of massive space telescopes. Here, the scientists are upbeat: they call K2-141b ""an especially good target for atmospheric observations.""

And the researchers even have a way to pass their time before the James Webb Space Telescope launches, the scientists said in the statement: they have acquired Spitzer Space Telescope observations that should help pin down the temperatures of the planet's day and night sides, clarifying how the models may match reality.

The research is described in a paper published Nov. 3 in the journal the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The move, long threatened by President Donald Trump and triggered by his administration a year ago, further isolates the U.S in the world but has no immediate impact on international efforts to curb global warming.

Some 189 countries remain committed to the 2015 Paris accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7 F), compared to pre-industrial levels. A further six countries have signed, but not ratified the pact.

Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.

The Paris accord requires countries to set their own voluntary targets for reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The only binding requirement is that nations have to accurately report on their efforts.

The United States is the world’s second biggest emitter after China of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and its contribution to cutting emissions is seen as important, but it is not alone in the effort. In recent weeks, China, Japan and South Korea have joined the European Union and several other countries in setting national deadlines to stop pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

While the Trump administration has shunned federal measures to cut emissions, states, cities and businesses in the United States have pressed ahead with their own efforts.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said he favors signing the U.S. back up to the Paris accord.

With the United States outside the pact, it will be harder for the rest of the world to reach the agreed goals."

While daily infections were rising in all but three states, the surge was most pronounced in the Midwest and Southwest.

Missouri, Oklahoma, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and New Mexico all reported record high hospitalizations this week. Nebraska’s largest hospitals started limiting elective surgeries and looked to bring in nurses from other states to cope with the surge. Hospital officials in Iowa and Missouri warned bed capacity could soon be overwhelmed.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The resurgence loomed over candidates and voters, fearful of both the virus itself and the economic toll of any new shutdowns to control its spread. The debate over how far to take economically costly measures has divided a country already sharply polarized over President Donald Trump’s turbulent four years in office.

The infection rate is definitely a leading indicator for hospitalizations, and the hospitalization rate is a leading indicator of mortality.

Meanwhile, Iowa hospital officials warned their facilities and staff could be overwhelmed without serious efforts to curtail the virus spread. The state's seven-day rolling average of positive cases reached 36.4 percent over the weekend, the third-highest in the nation behind South Dakota and Wyoming, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations reached a record 730 on Monday.

Suresh Gunasekaran, CEO of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, said Iowa is entering its third peak, one that is higher than previous ones in May and July. He said his biggest concern is that this peak comes at the beginning of the cold weather season, when the flu and other respiratory conditions typically increase hospitalizations.

“The infection rate is definitely a leading indicator for hospitalizations, and the hospitalization rate is a leading indicator of mortality,” Gunasekaran said.

Health officials in Nebraska said hospitalizations have doubled in recent weeks, reaching a record 613 on Sunday.

""No doubt if this trend continues — not just at our hospitals — but every hospital in the state could be at capacity in a very short period of time,” Dr. Cary Ward, chief medical officer for CHI Health’s network of 14 hospitals across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa said during a video call with reporters.

In Missouri, leaders of several rural hospitals raised alarms about bed capacity during a conference call Monday with Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who drew renewed fire from his Democratic election challenger for his refusal to issue a statewide mask mandate. The state health department reported 1,659 hospitalizations statewide, surpassing by 10 the previous record set a day earlier. Among the five additional deaths reported Monday was a 13-year-old boy, the first child under 14 to die from the virus in Missouri.

In Colorado, officials said more residents have been hospitalized with the coronavirus than at any time since a peak in April. Flags were flying at half-staff in New Mexico, where death from COVID-19 surpassed 1,000 last week and hospitalizations reached a record 380 on Monday.

The virus has killed more than 232,000 people in the country and total confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 9 million. As hospitalizations have climbed, so have deaths. The seven-day rolling average for deaths from COVID-19 has risen over the past two weeks from about 58,424 on Oct. 19 to 83,805 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.

Of equal concern is the fear of more economic pain if the country heads into another round of lockdowns to contain the virus. While the U.S. economy grew at a record 33.1 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, it has yet to fully rebound from the plunge in the spring.

But there were signs of the virus' resurgence hampering economic reopening even without government shutdown orders, as a fearful public stays away from riskier activities.

Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the bulk of the cruise industry, said its members are extending the suspension of U.S. sailing operations through the end of the year, just days after the U.S. government effectively lifted its no-sail order. The cruise industry group estimates that the suspension of cruises snuffed out more than $25 billion in economic activity and 164,000 American jobs.

What does that mean?,"Over the summer, the Food and Drug Administration announced that in order for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine to get the green light, it would need to be safe and “prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50 percent of people who are vaccinated.”

In fact, no vaccine is 100 percent effective, but some work better than others. One of the most successful is the measles vaccine — two doses are 97 percent effective in preventing the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Still, 50 percent sounds like a far cry from 97 percent.

“I know that 50 percent does sound low but that is still some protection, and some protection is better than no protection,” said Dr. Jeff Kwong, professor of public health and family medicine and interim director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto.

Based on the effectiveness threshold the FDA has set for a Covid-19 vaccine to be approved or granted emergency use authorization, it’s possible a vaccine becomes available that helps only half of people receiving it, while offering no benefit to the other half. It’s also possible that a vaccine could have different effects in different people – helping to prevent disease in some people while reducing the severity of Covid-19 in others.

But even if a Covid-19 vaccine is only 50 percent effective, it could make a difference, experts say, pointing out that the flu vaccine effectiveness can vary widely from year to year, anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent over the last decade, and the shots still offer benefits. When the flu vaccine matches up well with the influenza viruses that are circulating, the shots can reduce illness, hospitalizations and deaths, the CDC says.

And if enough people were immunized, a Covid-19 vaccine wouldn’t need to be near-perfect to have a substantial impact in the community, said Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group and editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine.

“If you had a 60 or 70 percent effective vaccine and everybody took it, you might actually be reaching toward herd immunity and potentially then dampen down this pandemic,” Poland said.

But researchers won’t know how effective the experimental vaccines are — if they are effective at all — until studies are completed.

“Right now, we have no idea if any of these vaccines work,” said vaccine researcher Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Most clinical trials underway now primarily are assessing whether Covid-19 vaccines prevent disease, Poland explained. Study results also may include additional information, such as whether vaccinated people who still contracted the virus became less sick than unvaccinated people who contracted it.

Once the studies are complete, they also may reveal who benefited the most from vaccination. Data, for instance, may show how a vaccine affected men as against women, various age groups, or people with underlying health conditions. Future studies and longer follow-ups may provide additional details about whether the vaccines ultimately reduce hospitalizations and deaths.

Availability of a vaccine likely won’t mean an immediate end to the pandemic, experts say.

Because it would take time to immunize millions of people, precautions such as masks, social distancing and hand-washing would remain important as long as the virus is circulating in the community.

Even if the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines aren’t as effective as hoped, Hotez said he’s not planning to pass up any of them. There might be the possibility he could get a booster later or even receive a different, more effective vaccine at some point, he said. For now, though, he would take what he can get.

“I would feel much better knowing that I got vaccinated and have some levels of virus-neutralizing antibody in my system,” he said. “Even if it’s not the best vaccine, it still could prevent me from going to the hospital or worse.”

Honestly, it’s almost become triggering to sign into the video chat site, reminding me of the early fear-filled days of the pandemic when we all turned to online “happy hours.”

But one saving grace of video hangout sessions has been the best thing to come out of the pandemic, for me anyway. I’m talking about the Zoom cookalong.

When my husband and I stopped getting restaurant meals cold turkey back in March, we turned to cooking at home as entertainment and solace. My income from our two Airbnbs had evaporated overnight so there was no spending money — and in the very early days we were afraid of going almost anywhere, entrusting our health and safety to unseen people preparing food.

But oh, did we miss people. Our Victorian, normally a bustling place full of friends and flowing with bourbon, went silent.

Then came drinking with friends, those evenings (and let’s be honest, afternoons) staring at each other’s tiny faces on screen as we all tried to process what was happening. But that’s not sustainable, and we all had to eat. Soon we were cooking. With friends, with family, and best of all, with people who lived hundreds or thousands of miles away.

Before COVID-19 we thought we were keeping up with our long distance friends through social media, but the turn to live (so to speak) interaction showed us how much we’d been missing. We’d prop the laptop up on the kitchen island — the one that used to have friends elbows’ leaned upon it — pour a wine or bourbon, and get busy cooking. Sometimes we’d cook independently, maybe with a theme like pizza night, but as our worlds contracted and we needed ever more ways to shift our focus from the falling sky, we began much more elaborate sessions.

A friend in Spain sparked the cookalong fervor. Julen was our tour guide last fall in the San Sebastian region of Spain, our last trip before lockdown (now a time that seemed like a beautiful dream), and had introduced us to Basque cuisine. Along with friends from New York and Austria that we’d made during our travels, we gathered as best we could the ingredients Julen listed for us, and — across three countries and four cities — spent a Sunday afternoon cutting and stirring, drinking and laughing. Was it the golden afternoon we’d spent preparing a feast in one of the gastronomic clubs of the Basque region? Of course not.

But we were together. Tantalizing smells — smells like the old days — filled our kitchens. Once in a while we’d pause our preparations to lean toward the screen and just smile at one another. Julen would occasionally break into song and dance. And when evening fell in Spain, he brought us outside with him on his laptop to join his neighbors in cheering for their frontline workers. And? We had a most delicious meal (and leftovers!) to sustain us through the dark days.

Other friends took it to new levels. Stacey and Shelby, consummate foodie friends in Florida, mapped out an epic, multi-course, Mexican dinner. I used one of our carefully allotted grocery shopping trips to load up at a Latin market, buying masa, a tortilla press, and fresh goods to make our feast. Going all out for the night I donned the pink cowboy hat and boots I’d bought — when we used to be able to jet off to other countries — in Guadalajara and poured margaritas. From their outdoor kitchen in Florida our friends led us and a dozen other folks from around the country in making a soul-soothing dinner of homemade guac, shrimp tacos with also homemade tortillas (really, we marveled, why did it take a pandemic to try these?), and salsa (likewise from scratch). The session went for hours, with everyone taking laptops to dining tables to fall upon the fruits of our labors. I hated signing off that night, losing that spark of connection that helped us feel that somehow things would be OK.

Companies were quick to tune into this trend, with sites like Goldbelly getting into the game. The platform that delivers meal kits and ingredients from restaurants around the country was already bringing travel-starved diners a taste of the cities we couldn’t visit. Then they turned the meal prep into a party. My husband and niece (who moved in with us during the pandemic) joined Iron Chef and Top Chef winner, and founder of Girl & the Goat, Stephanie Izard, for a cookalong. Aromas from Asia filled our kitchen as the high energy chef showed us (and other fans scattered across the country) how to make potstickers, slap noodles and a smashed cucumber salad. Trying our hands at something new, taking the idea of a cooking show and making it interactive, and sitting down to a meal that felt like something straight out of our travels was the best therapy."

Stephanie, who lives in Duluth, Minnesota, says she and her husband of two years woke up one morning in January 2020 and decided something had to change.

Stephanie and Brandon Engblom each weighed over 300 pounds in January 2020 when they started their weight-loss journey. Rubinski Visual

""We looked in the mirror, looked at each other and said, 'You know what, this is one of our lowest lows,'"" Stephanie told TODAY. ""We were both over 300 pounds, Brandon had just gotten diagnosed with sleep apnea and I was just feeling awful. My whole body ached every day.""

""We needed to make a change if we wanted to live a long, happy, healthy life together and maybe someday start a family,"" said the 25-year-old.

In less than a year, Stephanie has lost 116 pounds. Brandon has lost more than 80. The couple says there's been no fad diet or extreme exercise plan involved with their success. Instead, it's been about revamping their entire lifestyle into something they can keep up with forever.

""I've been overweight my entire life,"" said Stephanie. ""I have early memories of trying fad diets like Weight Watchers or low-carb and I would initially lose a little bit of weight, but I would never be able to keep it off long-term. I’d always gain it back plus five pounds.""

The couple says sustainability was key as they mapped out a plan for better health.

""We wanted this to be something where we could not only see results immediately,"" Stephanie, who works as a photographer, continued, ""but something we could stick to for ideally the rest of our lives so we wouldn’t have to keep playing this game.""

Stephanie and Brandon shared their keys to sustainable weight loss with TODAY.

Small changes

Stephanie says step one was cutting out little things that added up to an unhealthy lifestyle.

""For me, that was cutting out my sugary coffee and replacing it with lower-calorie options,"" she said. ""I'm still drinking coffee — I still have my lattes — but instead of whole milk and chocolate and syrup, I’m drinking almond milk and just espresso.""

They still enjoy their favorite dishes like pizza and tacos, with a healthier spin.

""For tacos, instead of cooking with ground beef we use ground turkey or chicken, and we use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and a little bit less cheese with more veggies,"" she explained. ""For pizza, we make it at home and use turkey pepperoni.""

""You can eat everything you want still, just in moderation,"" she continued. ""It's more about portion size and being mindful of how much you're eating rather than completely restricting yourself of certain foods.""

For Brandon, a 29-year-old attorney, it's all about focusing on protein.

""It was a big shift away from really carb-heavy pastas and things like that, and shifting into a much more protein-based diet because protein keeps you fuller for longer,"" he told TODAY. ""You can have really good meals that are based heavily in different types of protein and not feel like you're missing out or depriving yourself of a meal you really want to have.""

Brandon's tip for protein-packed comfort foods?

""We use things like chickpea noodles for example rather than traditional pasta — the difference in calorie load and protein you get out of that is just astronomical.""

Accountability

Stephanie and Brandon found greater success in having each other as weight-loss partners.

""It's strengthened our relationship,"" she said. ""I feel like we’ve only gotten stronger together and doing this with him has made it more possible than doing it alone.""

Stephanie also found accountability on social media: Between her TikTok and Instagram accounts, she has more than 120,000 followers supporting her and finding their own motivation from her weight-loss journey.

Stephanie says journaling has also been a way to stay accountable to herself for her health goals.

""I keep a weekly log of everything,"" she explained, ""what I’m eating, my emotions, why I’m wanting to eat. Journaling is something everyone can do because everyone should have a pen and a paper.""

Today, the Engbloms get the majority of their exercise by walking their dog. Stephanie Engblom

Movement

Stephanie used to think in order to lose weight, you had to do intense workouts at the gym every day of the week. Now, she's learned it's about finding sustainable ways she enjoys moving her body.

""We've been walking about a mile every day with our dog and we make an effort to make sure we’re doing something active,"" she said. ""It doesn’t have to be an actual workout each day, sometimes it’s cleaning the house or going outside or playing with the dog. It’s something that we’ve built into our routine so we’re not really viewing it as exercise, we’re viewing it as just our routine now.""

""We do go to the gym every now and then,"" she added, ""but we’ve really just been doing very light workouts — nothing crazy, just moving more.""

Routines

Exercise isn't the only routine the Engbloms have built into their lives.

""Stephanie puts it pretty well when she tells people if you’re going to lose weight, you can’t do it from a place of motivation because motivation is a very fleeting experience,"" Brandon explained. ""Maybe you have it for a couple of days or a month if you’re really dedicated, but that motivation will fade, so you have to ground it in routines.""

The duo has made daily tasks like drinking water, movement and making healthier food choices part of a routine they hope to keep up for the rest of their lives, rather than planning to follow a restrictive diet to get fleeting results.

""In the past, I'd wake up dreading the fact that I couldn’t have certain things or that I needed to restrict,"" Stephanie added. ""But this time around, it’s just a normal day, it’s just a routine now. Even on the days I’m not motivated, I’m determined to follow my routine.""

So what advice would the Engbloms give to others who are just starting out on a weight-loss journey?

""Make small changes: It doesn’t have to be complete restriction from the get-go,"" she explained. ""Something new each day that leaves you one step closer to your ultimate goal, whether that’s drinking more water today than you did yesterday or skipping the ketchup at dinner — just little things you can modify every day rather than completely cold turkey all at once because that is where you can run into trouble.""

For Brandon, who works as an attorney, it's all about knowing there's no going back.

""Be open to changing your mindset that this isn’t just you dieting, this is now your life and who you are going to be going forward. You have to know you’re going to alter your life in a way where this is your new normal."""
79,2020-11-09 14:05:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/what-pancreatic-cancer-symptoms-detection-treatment-more-t155129,Why is pancreatic cancer so deadly? How to spot early signs and more,"The death of ""Jeopardy!"" host Alex Trebek on Sunday was yet another high-profile reminder this year of the grim prognosis that comes with pancreatic cancer.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died from complications of the same disease in September. Rep. John Lewis died in July, just months after he learned he had stage 4 pancreatic cancer last December.

Trebek, who was diagnosed in March 2019, had been working with the World Pancreatic Coalition to raise awareness and teach people about the symptoms of the deadly disease. November is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.

In a public service announcement released last fall, Trebek said he wished he had been aware of the warning signs.

""I wish I had known earlier that the persistent stomach pain I experienced prior to my diagnosis was a symptom of pancreatic cancer,"" he said in the PSA.

What is the survival rate?

The overall statistics remain grim: More than 90% of patients die within five years of learning they have pancreatic cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.

That number rises to 97% of patients whose pancreatic cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, as in Lewis' and Trebek’s case. That makes it the lowest survival rate of all major cancers.

Ginsburg had been a rare long-term survivor, having been treated for pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Today marks the start of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month, a time where everyone comes together to give pancreatic cancer the recognition it needs!

“Nobody knows why these patients live longer than other people with pancreatic cancer, but something is clearly setting them apart,” said Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a member of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s David M. Rubenstein Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research in New York City, in a statement.

He’s the author of a 2017 study that found that “something” seemed to be the robustness of their own immune systems, with long-term survivors having almost 12 times the number of T cells — a type of immune cell that helps the body fight against invaders — inside their tumors than other patients.

What is pancreatic cancer?

The pancreas is a 6-inch long gland that lies between the stomach and the spine, the National Cancer Institute noted. It helps the body break down food and regulate blood sugar.

About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells, which produce the digestive “juices.”

Pancreatic cancers that begin in endocrine cells — which make hormones like insulin — are far less common, but also less aggressive.

Trebek hadn’t specified which kind of tumor he had, but it was likely the first type.

What are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer?

The early stage of the disease often causes no symptoms, which is why the cancer is so deadly: It’s usually caught only when it becomes large and spreads outside of the gland. It’s also hidden behind other organs including the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen and bile ducts.

Since the pancreas is located so deep inside the abdomen, patients won’t feel a lump like they might with breast cancer or notice any other obvious clues, Dr. Anirban Maitra, scientific director of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told NBC News.

Symptoms, when they do occur, can be vague and mimic the warning signs of other illnesses. They include:

Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes

Light-colored stools

Dark urine

Itchy skin

Pain in the upper or middle abdomen and back

Unexplained weight loss

Loss of appetite

Feeling very tired

Nausea and vomiting

Fewer than 20% of pancreatic cancers are confined to the pancreas when they are found.

What are the risk factors for pancreatic cancer?

There are some risk factors that a person can’t change, including age — with most patients over 65 — and having a family history of pancreatic cancer. Men and African Americans are slightly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than women and whites.

The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society also list risk factors that people do have influence over. They include:

Smoking

Being very overweight

Workplace exposure to certain chemicals used in the dry cleaning and metal working industries

How is pancreatic cancer diagnosed?

There are currently no approved early detection methods, but researchers hope tests that can pick up biomarkers for the cancer will become available in the next few years.

When patients complain of symptoms, the cancer can be found with imaging tests such as a CT scan, MRI and ultrasound. Certain blood tests, procedures and a biopsy can also help doctors diagnose the disease.

What is the treatment?

Surgery to remove part or all of the pancreas is an option for the minority of people whose pancreatic cancer was detected in its early stages.

Most people with pancreatic cancer receive chemotherapy, according to the Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research.

But chemotherapy and radiation can be hit or miss.

""Something that makes pancreatic cancer difficult is the tumor itself is surrounded by a dense microenvironment, so it makes getting the drug delivery difficult,"" Julie Fleshman, president and CEO of the patient advocacy organization Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in California, told NBC News.

Researchers are investigating targeted therapies based on the molecular makeup of a patient’s tumor.

Certain types of immunotherapy, which stimulates a person’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively, can also be used to treat pancreatic cancer, the American Cancer Society noted."

But even amid the partisan divide, a growing number of states — including some led by Republican governors — are now mandating face coverings.

More than half the states had issued mask requirements as of October 30, a move that public health experts say will help stop the spread of the coronavirus as cases surge in many regions.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who had resisted a statewide mask requirement, issued one in July, as did Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat.

But some political squabbles show no sign of abating: Georgia's governor in July sued Atlanta's mayor over the city's mask law, a day after he banned local governments from requiring the coverings.

They face a new reality that is very different from the one they are leaving behind. In fact, many feel they are at a disadvantage when it comes to finding work because they are starting over, a 2018 report found.

“Leaving the Army is a very difficult thing. They literally train you. They move your goods when you move. And they tell you what to wear and what time you show up for work,” said Bill Sweet, chief financial officer of financial planning firm Ritholtz Wealth.

Sweet understands those challenges. He served in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain before leaving in 2007. During his service, he was stationed in Iraq during the Iraq War and earned a Bronze Star Medal for his actions.

Sweet was also fortunate enough to be assigned as a tax assistance officer for his battalion during his last year in active duty. That gave him a skill that ultimately lead him to his current career in finance.

Now, he wants to help other vets find success after their military careers. And there are many. Each year, about 200,000 service members return to their civilian communities.

Here are three key things veterans should focus on, according to Sweet.

Look for a translatable skill

Driving a tank in the desert probably isn’t going to translate to a job in New York City, Sweet said.

However, there are other ways to build an expertise and “ultimately take that with you in your toolkit, out to the civilian world,” he said.

“Tax was my avenue. But there’s a lot of translatable skills within a military organization.”

Those can be things like finance, public affairs and logistics, all of which are great points for your resume.

Ask for help

In the military, active service members are taught to be self-reliant.

However, when it comes to transitioning into the civilian workforce, they need to ask for help, Sweet said.

“In the military, you think you’re alone. You think you’re going to do this for the first time. No,” he said. “There’s somebody that’s walked [in] those shoes in front of you. And it’s a matter of finding them.”

There are a number of organizations that want to help and hire veterans of the military. Fourblock, a nonprofit that offers vets free semester-long, university accredited courses is one of them.

Veterans on Wall Street or VoWS, is another organization. VoWS connects military talent with Wall Street banks to get veterans into the industry.

Find a mentor

When trying to land a job or if you find yourself in a new one, try to find a mentor who can guide you by offering advice and helping you get to know the ins and outs of a given field or organization.

It will not only help you land a job or advance your career, it can also help you enjoy your work. According to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey survey, 9 in 10 workers (91%) said having a mentor made them significantly happier with their jobs.

Sweet credits his mentors, Ritholtz CEO Josh Brown and Ritholtz chairman and CIO Barry Ritholtz, for helping him succeed. Sweet landed at the firm several years after leaving the Army, with just one financial job under his belt.

“They were willing to take a big chance on a veteran with not a ton of experience in financial services,” he said. “I will always be grateful for that.”

Starting the job search process can be overwhelming, but you can make it easier by focusing on your experience, skills, and interests. This will also help you develop your own brand. Use this guide as your job search plan of action:

Self-Assess: First, decide on the type of career you would like to have and consider how your experiences and skills fit into that path. After narrowing down your focus, research the positions you plan to apply for.

Brand Yourself: By determining what you have to offer, this will also help develop your brand. Play up your military experience as part of your brand, particularly for leadership and teamwork skills. The military is also a great place for learning discipline, problem-solving, communication skills, cultural understanding, project management, and how to take the initiative. To illustrate how your military training translates to a civilian workplace, explain that serving teaches people dedication, loyalty, following orders, and accomplishing goals.

Prepare: Put together your resume, pitch, and story for potential employers. This is important for networking and interviewing. Think about the skills and strengths you can play up. For example, hard skills include project management and problem-solving, while soft skills include working well with difficult people, doing a good job under pressure, negotiating or resolving conflicts, and working well managing or mentoring people.

Network: Networking is the best way to make contacts and to learn about jobs. By expanding your network, you’ll have a greater resource pool, the potential to meet more mentors, gain free advice, and get referrals for job interviews. To learn how to network, read our article here.

Apply: Use as many different sources as possible to learn about employment opportunities: search job boards, network, ask contacts, and use tools like LinkedIn. Then, apply for jobs.

Interview: During the interview, it’s crucial to show why you’re a good fit for the job. Highlight your past experiences and explain what makes you capable. To make a great first impression, always be courteous and professional. For more tips on acting an interview, read our article here.

89,2019-07-04 00:11:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/veteran-services/next-steps-for-vets/predatory-lenders-prey-military-members-here-s-how-avoid-being-n1026511,How military members can avoid predatory lenders,"After serving overseas, military service members return home to face a new economic reality that often includes, unfortunately, lenders looking to take advantage of their vulnerability.

These so-called predatory lenders, which pop up around military bases, try to entice or deceive young soldiers into taking out loans that impose abusive or unfair terms.

“Predatory lenders like to prey on young military members because they’re often inexperienced with money, have little to no credit and are usually very excited to spend that first paycheck,” said certified financial planner Tara Falcone, founder of the financial education company ReisUP. She is also a former hedge fund analyst and is married to an officer in the U.S. Navy.

The end result is a loan that carries a hefty price tag, with sky-high interest rates and hidden fees. For example, if a soldier is convinced to take out a payday loan, which requires a check dated for the next payday, he could ultimately wind up with an interest rate near 400%. Unscrupulous auto lenders and credit card companies have also been known to target members of the military.

“One of my husband’s sailors came to him one day and told him that a car dealership located near base had convinced him to take out a loan for twice the value of the car ...[at] an interest rate of nearly 20%,” Falcone said.

To remedy the situation, the sailor went to a local federal credit union, got a new loan at a lower rate and then paid off the predatory loan.

“By doing that, they saved over $100 on their car payment every month and over $7,000 in interest over time,” she said.

The government has moved to crack down on predatory lending, enacting the Military Lending Act in 2006. The law caps the interest rate on most consumer loans at 36%, yet military and veteran organizations have recently expressed concern about a lack of lender monitoring.

Last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stopped checking for compliance with the law. Earlier this year, the CFPB’s new director said the agency lacked explicit supervisory authority and requested that Congress give the CFPB that power.

“What we are seeing is really a pattern of neglect around consumer protections both for consumers generally, who are targeted by payday lenders, but also a disregard for fully implementing the Military Lending Act and making sure military members are not targeted by high-cost, abusive lenders,” said Tom Feltner, director of research at the Center for Responsible Lending.

A CFPB spokesperson said the bureau is “committed to the financial well-being” of U.S. service members.

“This commitment includes ensuring that lenders subject to our jurisdiction comply with the Military Lending Act, so our servicemembers and their families are provided with the protections of that law,” the spokesperson sa However, if you’re in the military, there are some things you can do to ensure you do not become another victim. Not only does predatory lending cause undue financial stress, it can also negatively impact a soldier’s military readiness, said Falcone.

Here are four tips from Falcone that can help servicemembers protect themselves.

1. Be proactive, not reactive

When trying to get a loan, arm yourself with information before you start the process. That means knowing your credit score and familiarizing yourself with current interest rates, as well as the fair value of the item you are going to purchase, Falcone advises.

“Don’t just trust that the lender is going to tell you the right thing,” she said.

2. Know how much you can afford

You need to look beyond just the monthly payment when it comes to figuring out your budget, said Falcone. Instead, know the “all-in cost” that you can afford, which includes taxes, fees and interest.

3. Learn the language of loans

Predatory lenders may try to coerce you into making a commitment by throwing around jargon you may not fully understand. Therefore, before looking into a loan, make sure you know how the process works.

“You need to understand how lenders can manipulate all the different factors in the loan borrowing process — that includes interest, payment and term — in order to sway it in their favor and make it seem like you’re getting a really good deal,” Falcone said.

4. Ask questions

Never take out a loan unless you have the answers to any questions you may have.

“When it comes to your money, you are the authority,” Falcone said. “If you have questions, make sure to ask them and, if anything feels crazy or strange, be prepared to get up and walk away from the deal.”

As a military spouse you are more or less tied to your partners schedule and are often not in one place long enough to set down roots let alone find a way to earn money. But former hedge fund analyst and wife to an officer in the U.S. Navy, Tara Falcone says spouses of service members do have options when it comes to creating wealth.

Falcone credits her family’s frequent moving as an inspiration to start her own business, ReisUP, as a certified financial planner, “starting my own business gives me the freedom, the freedom of location, of time and of income.”

Work remotely

The first piece of advice Falcone has for spouses is try to find a job that will allow you to work remotely. Thanks to technology it is easy to stay connected to colleagues and teams even if you are on the other side of the world.

Starting or continuing a career can seem daunting but Falcone says, “Today, spouses can and are working from home for companies in virtually every industry and at varying levels of their leadership structure.”

Common career fields include digital marketing, web design, copywriting, business development, finance, and research.

Control your investment plan

You don’t have to have a career to generate wealth for your family. Make sure the you and your service member are contributing enough to your retirement accounts.

These accounts include Thrift Savings Plan which is essentially the government version of a 401(k) plan. The TSP allows federal employees and members of the Armed Forces to save and invest for retirement in tax advantage way.

According to Falcone, the TSP offers two distinct advantages:

There are only six primary investment funds to choose from Each fund has a low expense ratio, which allows participants to keep and compound more of their investment returns.

Protect your wealth

Falcone offered some additional financial planning options and tips in a follow-up email to CNBC.

The 403(b), known as the “hip cousin” of the 401(k), is available to employees of certain schools, hospitals and non-profits.

Spousal IRAs are designed to help non-working or stay-at-home spouses contribute to retirement without having to meet the earned income requirement of a traditional IRA. While the Spousal IRA is not reserved solely for military spouses, the high unemployment rate among military spouses — as high as 24% in recent years — makes it popular.

There is no use in building up wealth if you cannot protect it. It is important to make sure that you and service member have adequate life, health, auto, disability and even pet insurance.

It is also wise to have an emergency fund for rainy days. While the amount of money in the fund can vary, most financial experts recommend at least six months of living expenses.

91,2019-05-23 15:02:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/veteran-services/next-steps-for-vets/military-families-financial-edge-find-money-matters-complex-n1009231,Military families find money matters complex,"Life is financially complicated for many U.S. military troops and their families.

Almost half of service members are under the age of 25, and a high percentage are married with children. They don’t get paid a lot and they must deploy repeatedly to difficult places, many times where their lives are on the line.

What other job makes someone do this?

And to be honest, even if the move isn’t to a dangerous place, it is disruptive and costs money … a lot of money.

Setting up a new household in a new location is a challenge and even more so if it is overseas. All those moves make it very difficult for military spouses to get and keep a job. Those spouses, who find it necessary to work to cover expenses, must deal with employers who know they might move to a new city at any time. That means the employer is hesitant to hire them at all.

On the plus side, troops do get benefits: housing and food allowances and health-care coverage. They may get health care on base, or they may have to use the local doctors and health-care facilities.

More from Invest in You:

And that can all change every time they move, and they do move often. As for housing, they might get a home to live in on a base, or they might get an allowance to find a home in a nearby community.

So, what do they need to do to stay financially ready, for both the military life and after they leave? First, because they tend to live on the edge financially, they need establish an emergency fund. Otherwise, the slightest event puts them in trouble and in debt and, for the troops and their families, those kinds of events can happen often and with no warning.

A service member doesn’t need to worry about the “normal” rules of having three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. They aren’t getting laid off, so three months of expenses is an adequate target. It is crucial that service members, like anyone else, stay out of serious debt.

However, service members who find themselves in serious debt are actually considered a security risk by the military and can lose security clearance. To be blunt, service members with no clearance are useless down-range. They lose their careers.

It’s key for those in the military to start on their retirement savings as early as possible.

Starting early puts time and the power of compounding interest on their side. I know that saving for retirement might seem difficult for a struggling young person, but the military offers service members the Thrift Savings Plan. It’s the federal government’s version of the civilian 401(k) plan and will match up of 5% of savings.

By setting aside 5% of their pay in the TSP, matched by the government at 5%, a service member has created a 10% savings rate. That is perfect for the young person just starting out. After a few years, they can increase their contribution to 10% for grand total of 15%. As always, starting early makes it so much easier in the long run.

The current military retirement system is basically what is known as a “defined retirement system.” This just means that you get a set retirement based on the number of years you are on active duty. There are currently three existing retirement systems, depending on when you entered the service.

The challenge these service members face is understanding the various types of benefits they can receive. It can become quite complicated, so it’s important to seek out professional assistance.

Of course, service members need insurance coverage.

Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance is low-cost term insurance for members of the uniformed services. SGLI is a group life insurance policy purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs from a commercial life insurance company. Each service member entering a period of active duty or reserve status is automatically covered for the maximum $400,000 death benefit. They should consider the least-costly approach (term life insurance) to cover college costs for the kids and the price of a home for their spouse for the family.

Perhaps the most important thing service members and their families, or any young couple, can do is to have a budget. I call it a “spending plan.”

The idea is to spend money with a purpose to achieve your priority goals. It’s not easy to do at the start, but, once you’ve established the habit, it will sustain you for life.

By fully understanding the implications of every spending decision, a service member can keep out of financial trouble. It’s a way to avoid deep debt and will include savings plan as part of their “spending plan.” The plan puts you in control of your money.

Finally, it’s very important to have an estate plan. The Judge Advocate General office (military attorneys) will provide the basics, including important paperwork such as a will, power of attorney, health-care proxy and more.

This is key because estate planning involves making decisions about how your property — real estate, investments, Social Security, cash, life insurance and business interests — is used, maintained and distributed if you become incapacitated and after your death.

Of course, if there are children involved, a trust is often recommended. There are pro bono attorney groups that can help with the more complex issues for service members. It’s worth the time to do the homework and find these groups. There are resources to help, but the troops need to ask.

Most military installations have personal financial counselors who can help to craft a plan. There are also pro bono professional programs from groups such as the Foundation for Financial Planning, Financial Independence Training and the Financial Planning Association that can help at no cost.

Of course, service members need to be willing to ask for some assistance with their money matters. We ask them to serve and protect us, so we financial professionals can use our skills to help them. It’s only fair.

From time away from home and family to dealing with health care and benefits after service, it can be challenging for veterans. The good news is that there are programs available to veterans that can help with saving, investing and building wealth over time.

The following programs are positioned to give a vet some financial guidance:

Blended Retirement System (for active duty and reservists): In January 2018, the traditional military pension system was converted to the Blended Retirement System. The BRS combines elements of the legacy retirement system with benefits similar to those offered in many civilian 401(k) plans.

The program was designed to help the Department of Defense save money by reducing the costs of the existing pension system. Under the old system, a service member would have to stay in for a full 20 years to qualify for the military pension.

Fewer than 20% of service members who enlist actually choose to make the military their career and retire out. The rest would separate from service with no retirement benefits. The BRS changes that.

Here are some pros:

Provides a benefit to service members even if they choose not to spend 20 years in the military.

Includes a government match of 1% on the Thrift Savings Plan, and vesting happens after just two years.

Receive a ""continuation pay"" bonus after 12 years of service that is paid to you as cash.

The pension option is still there for you if you serve for 20 years. There is also a ""lump sum"" payout that is available to you at retirement.

Here are some cons:

Overall retirement benefit from the BRS can be lower than the original pension.

Service members who joined after January 1, 2018 no longer have access to the original pension.

It can be confusing and a bit complicated.

Requires that service members actively participate in their retirement.

Savings Deposit Program (for active duty and reservists): The Savings Deposit Program is a Department of Defense-sponsored savings account that offers deployed military members a guaranteed return on investment of 10% interest, compounded quarterly, on deposits of up to $10,000.

The program is one of the best savings options for young service members who are deployed in active combat zones around the world. The program pays 10% annualized rate of return on the contributions. In addition, the contributions are tax-free as long as they are made in a qualified tax-exempt zone. This offers an easy and effective way to put away $10,000.

Here are some pros:

Guaranteed 10% interest on contributions.

Funds and interest accumulate tax-free while service member is deployed in a qualified tax-exempt area.

Super simple to save because contributions are done through salary allotment.

Interest accrues for up to 90 days after leaving a combat zone.

Here are some cons:

You must be in a combat zone for at least 30 days or 1 day per month for 3 consecutive months to be eligible to participate.

Maximum contribution is limited to $10,000 per deployment.

You cannot make contributions once you leave the combat zone. In addition, you won't have access to the funds for 120 days after your deployment unless your balance is more than $10,000.

If there is a financial emergency, you would have to get permission from your unit commander to get an early distribution.

Thrift Savings Plan (for service members not on the BRS): The Thrift Savings Plan is the federal government's version of the civilian 401(k) plan. The rules are the same regarding contributions, distributions, required minimum distributions and so forth.

The key difference is that the TSP is the only plan that offers access to the Government Securities Investment Fund, or G Fund, in addition to four index funds. The G Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasurys, and contributions, as well as interest payments, are guaranteed by the U.S. government. This means that the G Fund cannot lose money. However, the G Fund does still have some risk.

Here are some pros:

It works like a 401(k) plan. Service members who become federal civilian employees may be eligible for a match.

The G Fund is backed by special issue Treasury bills and guaranteed by the U.S. government. It serves as a hedge against market fluctuations.

Service members can contribute while deployed to qualified tax-exempt areas. Contributions made deployed to these areas are tax-free and continue to grow tax-deferred.

Can be rolled over into a traditional individual retirement account or Roth IRA (when applicable).

Here are some cons:

The G Fund is only available in the TSP.

The G Fund is subject to inflation risk. Cost-of-living expense could potentially grow faster than the interest that accrues in the fund.

There is a limited number of investment options and no brokerage option.

There is no match for service members who are on the traditional pension retirement program.

Small Business Administration Express Loan program (for active duty, reservists and veterans): Looking to start, buy or grow a business? The SBA has you covered. An Express loan issued through the SBA 7(a) Express Loan program could give a service member the cash they need to get up and running fast.

The Express Loan Program provides up to $350,000 to start or grow a business and loans can be approved in as little as 36 hours. Service members and veterans get the added benefit of priority processing and having guaranty fees waived. That's a savings of 3% or more on the cost of the loan.

Here are some pros:

Quick turn-around and priority processing for military and veterans.

Up to $350,000 for business (including real estate purchases).

Can be structured as a line of credit or traditional loan depending on the business' needs.

Guaranty fees for SMs and veterans waived.

Here are some cons:

Interest rates may be higher than conventional loan options (SBA interest rate is the prime rate plus 4.5% to 6.5%).

Very specific limits on what can and cannot be done with the loan.

Must have excellent credit and a well-structured business plan to qualify.

Loans limited to $350,000.

Being your own boss can be immensely rewarding. Though the start-up process can seem overwhelming, it can be boiled down to a few key actions. Getting a company up and running requires planning, making important financial decisions, and completing legal paperwork, but you can start by following these 12 steps:

Step 1: Define your business and market demand

Before launching a business, make sure there is a market for your idea. Start by asking yourself a few key questions, including what problem is your business solving? Who is your customer? Who would be your existing main competitors, and how does your idea differ? Do some research to answer these questions and see how your business will stack up. The answers will help you develop an action plan—and possibly tweak your idea—to get your venture off to a successful start.

Step 2: Write a business plan

You don’t need an MBA to write a business plan. In fact, it can be as short and simple as one page. Think of it as a three to five year guide that will help you map out how to start your company and successfully run it. Your business plan should include what goods or services your company will offer, your target customer, how much you will charge, and how you’ll fund and market your product. Do research beforehand to make sure there is enough of a potential customer base. Take a close look at your defined audience and decide whether you’ll exist for a local, national or niche market, and whether you’ll run an e-commerce or physical operation.

Step 3: Fund your business

Capital is necessary to start every company. If you don’t have the cash, look beyond your own wallet. First, determine how much you’ll need and where the money will come from. If you plan to approach investors, perfect your business plan and your elevator pitch. Consider government backed loans, venture capital and research grants, as well as newly popular crowdfunding sites, in which your network of family and friends contribute to start-up costs. As a veteran, you’re entitled to a special U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, called Patriot Express.

Step 4: Determine your business structure

Decide which form of ownership is best for you: sole proprietorship, partnership, Limited Liability Company (LLC), corporation, S corporation, nonprofit or cooperative. Your business type determines which income tax you’ll file. Each type of business structure has its pros and cons, so it’s best to consult an accountant and a lawyer, if possible.

Step 5: Choose and register a business name

A name says a lot about your business, but there’s more to picking one than being catchy—it has to be legally available. To make sure someone else doesn’t own it, check online at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However, you can still infringe on someone else’s trademark even if it’s not registered there, so also search state and local databases. When choosing a name, keep branding in mind; the title should be clear, easy to remember and spell, and something you can grow with.

In addition to selecting your business name, you may also need to register a fictitious business name, known as a DBA (Doing Business As). A DBA is needed when your company does business under a different name, and if the company name is different from your own name.

Finally, make sure your business name is available as a web domain (omitting hyphens, if possible), then register it immediately. If the dot.com suffix is taken, try dot.net or another suffix. Avoid dot.org, unless you’re filing as a non-profit. Once your business name and domain are finalized, make business cards. They should include your name, address, email address, website, phone number, and social media links, like your Facebook page or Twitter handle. Some also include a short phrase describing their company.

Step 6: Create a marketing plan

Thanks to social media, marketing has gotten a lot easier. Build your brand’s name by expanding your company’s online presence. Create a website, a Facebook page and Twitter account, and depending on the nature of your company, considering using Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest as well. By interacting directly with your market, customers will feel more engaged. Update your website and social media accounts frequently, and read up on SEO (search engine optimization) to maximize your web presence. Another effective tactic is email marketing: Build a list of potential customers, business associates and colleagues (you can have them sign up on your website), and send them regular updates.

Step 7: Get a Tax Identification Number

To mark your business as a separate legal entity, you’ll need to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number, also referred to as an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Similar to a social security number, a tax ID lets the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) track business transactions. Though they aren’t mandatory for sole proprietors, they’re recommended so that you don’t have to use your social security number for business practices. The application process is free, quick and simple; apply online at the IRS website.

Step 8: Open a business bank account

Never mix your personal and business bank accounts, which could lead to a run-in with the IRS and affect your mortgage and loan payments, as well as other personal finances. Instead, use a business bank account for all of your company’s transactions. Open one in the name of your business and EIN. Additionally, you may want to open a business credit card to avoid using a personal one for company matters.

Step 9: Figure out your taxes

Your business structure will determine the types of taxes you’ll have to pay. All businesses, except for partnerships, are required to file an annual income tax return. Depending on whether or not you have employees, you may also have to pay employment taxes (which include social security and Medicare taxes) and a self-employment tax. Additionally, decide if you’ll pay taxes according to the calendar year or the fiscal year (you can determine that schedule).

Step 10: Get the necessary licenses and permits

While every locality has different requirements, all demand business licenses—even if yours only exists online. Make a list of federal, state and local licenses and permits required for your business. (Find more information here.) If you have a physical storefront, familiarize yourself with zoning laws from the county clerk’s office. Use your company’s EIN instead of your Social Security number when filing paperwork.

Step 11: Learn relevant laws and regulations

If you’re starting an online business, contact the Federal Trade Commission to learn about e-commerce regulations.

If you’re hiring employees, spend time with an employment law professional to learn and understand the legal steps you need to take. Familiarize yourself with federal and state payroll and withholding taxes, unemployment insurance, anti-discrimination laws, workers’ compensation rules, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, and wage and hour requirements.

Step 12: Set up your accounting system

Bookkeeping can be simple, at least when you first start your business. Begin with an Excel spreadsheet that lets you track money you spend and receive; include columns for revenues and expenses, and add more as you go. When you’re ready for a more formal system, invest in business accounting software like QuickBooks.

Eric Wanner, a sergeant in the U.S. Army, and his wife, Jana, have moved four times in the last 12 years — most recently to Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Because of frequent deployments and moving expenses, as well as cost-of-living adjustments and erratic pay, the couple struggles when it comes to managing their household finances.They are raising a family on a single military income.

For example, “when we came back from overseas we had to rent a car for two months while we waited for our other car to get shipped,” said Jana Wanner. “That was a massive expense.”

In fact,service members and their spouses ranked financial stress as their greatest concern, even over deployment, according to Blue Star Families’ annual military family lifestyle survey.

Members of the Arizona National Guard listen to instructions on April 9, 2018, at the Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix. - Arizona deployed its first 225 National Guard members to the Mexican border on Monday after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the frontier region to combat drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

Nearly 9 in 10 active service members and 84% of spouses or partners have worries about personal finances, according to a separate report by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, which also did the same survey of military personnel five years ago.

Rather than have some of those challenges subside as the economy improved, more military families are worried about meeting basic household needs and debt payments today than in 2014, the NFCC found.

In fact, service members are now twice as likely not to be able to pay all their bills on time than they were just a few years ago.

Roughly 3 in 10 spouses or partners of service members said they do not pay their bills on time and about 1 in 10 said they currently have debts in collection, according to the survey.

Still, because of issues such as increased childcare costs during periods of deployment and the likelihood of relocation, it can be hard for spouses to find full-time employment to supplement their military incomes and build retirement savings.

As a result, about half of service members and their spouses of service members say they rely on the gig economy to stay afloat, the NFCC found.

In general, people are struggling to make ends meet, said Rebecca Steele, president and CEO of the NFCC. That’s “amplified in military households.”

“Men and women in uniform face many challenges and daily sacrifices while serving our country,” she added. “Financial concerns shouldn’t be one of them.”

To that end, Josh Andrews, a certified financial planner and advice director at financial services firm USAA in San Antonio, offers the following tips to active duty military and their spouses or partners:

Start early

Beginning with your first paycheck, opt to take the full Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance coverage amount and increase automatic contributions to the military’s Thrift Savings Plan to at least 10%.

With what is left, learn to live well within your means — spend less than you earn and put what you can into an emergency fund.

Pay down debt

If you do have debt, develop an attack strategy. Figure out which loans are costing you the most, and make it a priority to pay those off first.

Payday loans, also called cash advances, are the worst offenders, with interest rates that can easily run into the triple digits.

Plan for the inevitable

Consider where you will be living with every Permanent Change of Station, or PCS, and then adjust your budget accordingly.

From groceries to gasoline, the cost of living can vary substantially by location.

Take a long-term view

The majority of those in the military do not serve until retirement. Consider other education options and training programs and make sure a transition plan for benefits, including health insurance and pensions, is secured before departure from the service.

You can keep on top of the many benefits the military offers, as well as whatever financial education it makes available, through Military OneSourceor other channels.

For its part, the NFCC offers financial education and credit counseling through its member agencies.

Institutions such as USAA also regularly work with current and former service members and offer a range of banking and insurance products.

And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau site for service members has many resources related to protecting finances and planning for the future.

""On Veterans Day, we take time out to highlight what it means to live a life of sacrifice — how all the moves, all the goodbyes, all the new schools, moving trucks, and crazy schedules aren’t for nothing. They matter to our country.""

How can parents help kids honor our veterans while maintaining proper social distancing? A good start is to educate them on the history of Veterans Day and why we celebrate, followed by some easy (and safe!) activities.

Rememer why we celebrate Veterans Day

Each year, Veterans Day is observed on Nov. 11, regardless of the day of the week. Why Nov. 11? It’s the day that signifies the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when World War I ended.

The holiday was originally called Armistice Day and was observed for the first time on Nov. 11, 1919 — the first anniversary of the end of World War I. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower officially changed the name of the holiday from Armistice Day to Veterans Day — a day to honor American veterans of all wars for their patriotism and willingness to serve and sacrifice.

Thank a veteran together

“A great way for parents and kids to say thank you to our veterans is by creating a card, letter or poster,"" says Kitty Harris, a Navy veteran and mom from San Diego, California. ""Art is a fun way for children to express themselves and show their appreciation for our veteran communities while social distancing.”

Maddie Clegg, 6, is the daughter of Air Force Maj. Nathaniel Clegg, and wanted to help celebrate veterans like her dad.

“She drew a soldier in a flight suit with a hat and an American flag, because that’s how she sees the military every day at home,” Maxine Clegg, Maddie’s mom shared with TODAY Parents.

Make a call or plan a virtual celebration

Celebrating the day can be as simple as calling a veteran to have a meaningful conversation about their story serving our country. If you don’t have a family member who’s a veteran, ask friends and others in your network if they know a veteran.

With virtual meetings so popular these days, organize a Zoom call honoring family military members. Everyone on the call could wear military tees or the colors of their favorite branch of the military and share service photos and stories of the veterans in your life.

Decorate your house and yard

Looking to keep the celebrations at home? Parents can have kids paint rocks red, white, and blue with messages of gratitude to place in a garden or create homemade posters to place in the windows or on the front door. Harris suggests that kids decorate the sidewalk with colorful chalk to create a special “Thank You” that honors veterans. Pinterest is full of craft ideas, from homemade handprint American flags and patriotic wind socks to wreaths and fans.

Watch veterans share their oral histories

The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City has a unique Oral History Project, which collects first-hand stories of those who served on board the Intrepid, the submarine Growler, and more.

Susan Marenoff-Zausner, president of the museum, says watching the stories is a great way for families to get a real feel for what military life is like. ""Watching these interviews, which vividly depict triumphs and even lighthearted moments from times of service, can encourage meaningful conversations and a deeper understanding of why it’s so important to recognize our brave service men and women,” Marenoff-Zausner said.

Take a virtual tour of war memorials

This virtual tour includes stops and information about numerous war memorials, including the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, and the United States Marine Corps War Memorial.

Watch a wreath-laying ceremony

Every Veterans Day, memorials across the country — including Arlington National Cemetery — hold wreath laying ceremonies. Be sure to check the individual websites of your local memorials and Arlington National Cemetery for information on possible virtual commemorations of Veterans Day 2020.

""Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,"" Trump told aides after he scrapped a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018 to honor the dead service members, according to The Atlantic, which cited four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion. Trump, on the same trip, later referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives in the Battle of Belleau Wood in France as ""suckers"" for getting killed, the magazine reported.

The comments are in stark contrast with the president's public persona as a champion of the military and a fighter for veterans. The Battle of Belleau Wood, which lasted 20 days in June 1918 and ended with German forces soundly defeated, was a defining moment in World War I for the Marine Corps.

""What animal would say such a thing?"" Trump said Thursday night as he returned from a campaign rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. ""And especially since I've done more, I think more than almost anybody, to help our military to get the budgets, to get the pay raises for our military. So I just think it's a horrible thing that they are allowed to write that. We can refute it. We have other people that will refute it.""

""It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that is a terrible magazine,"" Trump added. ""I don't read it. I just heard about it, but they made it up. Probably it's a couple of people that have been failures in the administration.""

The White House also denied the report.

""This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He's demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much-needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact,"" White House communications director Alyssa Farah told NBC News in a statement.

Deputy press secretary Judd Deere also denied the report in a tweet, calling it an ""anonymously sourced story."" The Atlantic said it spoke with multiple sources on condition of anonymity. The Associated Press said it had confirmed some details in the Atlantic report. NBC News has not independently verified the report.

Not a soul brave enough to put their name on any of these accusations. That's because they are false. Just another anonymously sourced story meant to tear down a Commander-in-Chief who loves our military and has delivered on the promises he's made. What a disgrace! https://t.co/NInGxeDcI2 — Judd Deere (@JuddPDeere45) September 3, 2020

In 2018, the White House claimed that Trump canceled the trip because a rainy forecast for the city made it too risky for him to fly there safely.

Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, criticized Trump in a statement Thursday.

""If the revelations in today's Atlantic article are true, then they are yet another marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the President of the United States,"" Biden said, adding, ""And if I have the honor of serving as the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice — always.""

It is not the first time Trump's boasting about the military has been at odds with his statements.

He lashed out at Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. ""He's not a war hero,"" Trump, then a Republican candidate for president, said in 2015 at a town hall in Iowa. ""I like people who weren't captured.""

At the same event, Trump said ""I don't like losers"" after having talked about McCain's losing the 2008 presidential election.

""I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So I have never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers,"" he said.

As a candidate, he also attacked Khizr and Ghazala Khan, a Gold Star family whose son Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in 2004 while serving as an Army captain.

The magazine also reported Thursday that when McCain died in August 2018, Trump told his aides, ""We're not going to support that loser's funeral,"" citing three sources with direct knowledge of the remark.

The magazine said Trump, who was not invited to McCain's funeral, became furious when he saw flags that had been lowered to half-staff to honor McCain, citing witnesses to the event.

""What the f--- are we doing that for? Guy was a f-----g loser,"" the president said, according to The Atlantic.

Meghan McCain, the late senator's daughter, said in a pair of tweets Thursday that she was hurt by the reported remarks.

I just got through two years without my Dad a few days ago. The loss is still incredibly painful and raw. No one is more acutely aware of how vile and disgusting Trump has been to my family, it is still hard to understand - America knows who this man is... — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 4, 2020

""No one is more acutely aware of how vile and disgusting Trump has been to my family, it is still hard to understand - America knows who this man is...,"" she wrote, adding, ""This never stops being incredibly painful, triggering, and it rips off new layers of grief that wreak havoc on my life. I wouldn't wish any of it on my worst enemy. I truly pray for peace for my family, our grief, and for this country.""

In a series of tweets Thursday night, Trump called the story ""a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election.""

I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets, but the lowering of our Nations American Flags, and the first class funeral he was given by our.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2020

Trump said that he ""was never a big fan of"" McCain's and disagreed with him on ""many things"" but that he approved the lowering of flags and using Air Force One to fly his body from Arizona to Washington ""without hesitation or complaint.""

""Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!"" he wrote."
103,2020-11-04 19:04:48+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/which-foods-cause-inflammation-avoiding-inflammatory-foods-lowers-heart-disease-t197387,Which foods cause inflammation? Avoiding inflammatory foods lowers heart disease risk,"There’s more to heart health than controlling cholesterol and blood pressure. Keeping chronic inflammation in check also plays a big role — another factor where diet can make a difference, a new study has found.

People who ate lots of red meat, processed meat, refined carbohydrates and other foods with higher “inflammatory potential” had a 46% higher risk of heart disease and a 28% higher risk of stroke compared to people who ate an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits and vegetables, researchers reported this week in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

That may be happening because inflammation drives changes in blood vessels, leading to the development of atherosclerosis — the buildup of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances inside the arteries, said Dr. Jun Li, lead author of the study.

“Diet can help,” Li, a research scientist in departments of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told TODAY.

A healthy diet “can help us manage chronic low-grade inflammation… and help us maintain a balance inside your body, but a bad diet can increase the basic inflammation level of our body,” she noted.

The results are based on three study cohorts that included more than 166,000 women and almost 44,000 men, with 24 to 30 years of follow-up. The participants regularly filled out questionnaires about their diets, to which Li and her co-authors assigned a score based on that eating pattern’s potential to cause inflammation.

When the researchers analyzed the scores and the participants’ health, they found eating more inflammatory foods was associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers and triglyceride levels in the blood, along with reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol — the “good” cholesterol that can lower the risk for heart disease and stroke.

Diets with higher inflammatory potential were “significantly associated” with a higher incidence of heart disease and stroke, even after the results were adjusted for alcohol use, smoking, salt intake and blood pressure.

“We controlled for almost every risk factor, mediator and other confounders we can think of and the association between dietary inflammatory potential and cardiovascular disease risk still remained super robust,” Li said. “This part was surprising to us.”

How to lower chronic inflammation:

The goal is to eat fewer foods with higher pro-inflammatory potential such as:

Red meat

Processed meat

Organ meat

Refined carbohydrates, such as white flour and white rice

Sweetened beverages

Instead, eat more foods with higher anti-inflammatory potential, including:

Green leafy vegetables: kale, spinach, cabbage, watercress, romaine lettuce, Swiss chard, arugula and endive

Dark yellow vegetables: pumpkin, yellow peppers, beans and carrots

Whole grains: wheat, oat, rye, buck wheat and millet

Fruits: especially blueberries, pomegranate, orange, cherries, strawberry, apples and pears

Tea, coffee and red wine

Extra virgin olive oil

Fatty fish

These foods contain anti-inflammatory compounds such as vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols, fiber and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.

A separate study in the same issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found incorporating a daily 1-2 ounce dose of walnuts into the diets of older people “significantly reduced” several inflammatory biomarkers after two years. The study was supported by a grant from the California Walnut Commission.

It was the largest and longest nut trial to date, and shows why the anti-inflammatory effects of walnuts can reduce the risk of heart disease beyond lowering cholesterol, wrote Dr. Ramon Estruch, a physician at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain, in an accompanying editorial.

“When choosing the foods in our diet, we should beware of their pro- and anti-inflammatory potential,” he advised.

The best way to do that may be to follow the Mediterranean diet, Li said. It naturally includes lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains while minimizing red meat. Since it’s not possible to eliminate all inflammatory foods for most people, she suggested taking small steps towards eating fewer of them. Replace refined grains with whole grains, for example.

The current study doesn’t address whether a person who has been eating lots of pro-inflammatory foods for years can still reduce their heart disease risk by switching to an anti-inflammatory diet, but Li said other research offers hope that would happen.

Making such a switch can lead to weight loss, previous studies have shown.

“From this perspective, it is highly possible that changes in dietary inflammatory potential will also have a long-term effect of cardiometabolic disease risk,” Li said."
104,2020-10-30 18:21:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/how-widen-your-social-circle-winter-t196710,How to widen your social circle for winter,"Have some of your friendships fallen by the wayside after all these months of social distancing? According to Niro Feliciano, a cognitive psychotherapist and author of the podcast “Coping With The New Normal of COVID-19,” you’re not alone. The pandemic has been taking a toll on relationships.

“A lot of friendships have been very much fractured during this time of COVID-19, as well as the election,” she told TODAY.

There have been differences of opinion on whether — and to what extent — we follow pandemic safety protocols. The presidential election has also been polarizing. And beyond that, simply not being able to get together in person has made it harder to maintain relationships (though easier to weed some less important ones out, too).

With the election upon us and winter drawing closer, coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country. Public health officials are advising stepping up social distancing, which in cold-weather regions means it’ll be difficult to comfortably gather in socially distant ways outdoors. But that’s not an excuse to become a hermit.

People are finding creative ways to meet new friends, both on- and offline, in safe, socially-distant ways, said Feliciano. She explained that many are organizing virtual events on social platforms where they can get to know others over like-minded interests, such as a shared love of books or cooking, for example. Another thing you can do, she said, is create an event that can be hosted over Zoom (or another video conferencing platform). Invite people you know on social media and encourage them to invite their friends, who can in turn invite others.

“I think the goal here is to get to know people over a shared experience, so it kind of takes the pressure off just having to completely focus on conversation,” Feliciano said. “But we kind of get to know their personality as it comes out doing these things.”

Here are six creative options for meeting new people during the pandemic.

Virtual book and podcast clubs

Virtual happy hours

Virtual trivia nights

Virtual cook-off

Virtual arts and crafts nights

Socially-distanced dinners outside

1. Organize a virtual book or podcast club

Virtual book clubs have been popular during the pandemic, according to Feliciano, though she pointed out that many people have been too anxious or busy to read. If that’s the case for you, she recommends organizing a virtual podcast club, which you can host over Zoom. “Find one podcast episode that was meaningful to you or interesting and share it with your friends, because that's something people can do while they're folding laundry or cooking dinner, or whatever it might be, and it's not the same kind of commitment as reading a whole book,” she said. People can choose to just listen, or to discuss it together afterward.

2. Host virtual happy hours

Love making your own cocktails? Virtual happy hours proliferated during the spring quarantine. Feliciano suggested making them even more engaging by picking a cocktail recipe each week that everyone can make and then sip together. “There's a little bit more connectedness than just kind of jumping on a Zoom call where everyone's drinking,” she said.

3. Plan virtual trivia nights

Are you obsessed with trivia? Whether it’s with other adults or the entire family, trivia nights can be a fun way to connect with like-minded people. Trivias can revolve around a favorite theme that everyone shares, whether it’s a favorite TV series, holiday, music, sports or any other shared interest.

Dr. Meredith Renda, a pediatrician in Connecticut, says she and her family have been participating in trivia nights since the pandemic started. Most recently, they joined a Zoom-based Harry Potter trivia night, she said. The organizer asked questions, and families sent their answers over the messaging feature, which the organizer reviewed and tallied at the end. “It has felt like a nice breath of fresh air sometimes when you get to sort of see all these other families and realize that everyone's kind of doing the same thing you are,” she said.

4. Arrange a virtual cook-off

With many restaurants closed, lots of people are testing their skills in the kitchen. If you’re spending more time over the stove, why not invite others to see what you’re making? Each week, you can host a virtual cook-off over Zoom. You can make your own dishes or suggest a recipe that everyone has to make. “People are making (recipes), and you can see what people are doing (while) cooking,” said Feliciano. “They're jumping in and out of that process, and talking with friends. I know people who've done that. It's been great for them.”

5. Set up virtual arts and crafts nights

Have you been spending more time on personal art projects? Whether it’s painting, knitting or anything crafty, getting together with others online to do something fun and creative is a great way to connect with others. “You could even have a teacher do it on the Zoom call to instruct you,” suggested Feliciano. “And they're fairly simple, but a lot of fun. So you're talking, you're connecting, but you're also painting, you're having a cocktail.” Virtual arts and crafts nights can also be great ways for kids and families to connect, she added.

6. Throw small socially-distanced dinner parties outside

As the pandemic stretches into the winter, you can still meet others in person, as long as you are practicing appropriate social distance guidelines and meeting outdoors, say public health experts. Renda and her husband put up a large open tent in their backyard. They keep it warm with space heaters and host socially-distanced meals for friends and family. Occasionally, either she or her husband will invite a co-worker and his or her significant other over for dinner in the tent.

It’s been a way for them to meet new people face to face without breaking social distancing protocols, said Renda. To stay safe, they only invite one couple over at a time, and keep tables, food and disposable utensils separate — with sanitizer and hand wipes on each table. She added that they try to limit meals to only an hour. “I think that the most important thing, when you're thinking about meeting someone, or a family, in person, is to be very clear about your expectations and their expectations,” she said."

Her husband rushed her to USA Health University Hospital, a familiar trip for the Mobile, Alabama resident. Mason-Cooley, 37, regularly experiences excruciating pain as a result of sickle cell disease, a disorder in which abnormally crescent-shaped red blood cells can get stuck in blood vessels and prevent the flow of blood and oxygen to parts of the body.

After 24 hours at the hospital, her pain still hadn’t subsided, but her doctor decided to take her off of medications despite her pleas that she was unable to walk and was still in crisis.

Amy Mason-Cooley, 37, of Mobile, Alabama, has struggled to get adequate treatment for sickle cell disease. Amy Mason-Cooley

“As soon as he stopped all my medications, my blood count started dropping,” she told TODAY. “It dropped down (low enough that) they started talking about doing a transfusion.”

She advocated for herself, telling the doctor, “I don't want you to be in control of my care because you are not listening to me.”

He ignored her requests and, according to her, even smirked in response. It wasn’t until other medical staff came in and got her back on her medication hours later that she finally stabilized.

“I don't want you to be in control of my care because you are not listening to me.”

Mason-Cooley filed a complaint with the hospital, and recounted her experience in a Facebook post that was shared over 13,000 times before she made it private. The post hit a nerve for numerous people across the country who have been denied appropriate care after their own pain was dismissed.

While the hospital did not return a request for comment, they did post a statement to their Facebook page saying they “investigate all complaints,” after Mason-Cooley’s post went viral.

A shared experience among Black women

Mason-Cooley’s experience is all too familiar to other Black women, who are caught between being considered impervious to pain because of their race, and overly hysterical about pain because of their gender.

“Pain is an area ripe for implicit bias having an impact because it's an extremely subjective area,” said Janice Sabin, a research professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, who studies implicit bias in medicine. “If a person is bleeding, you can figure out how much blood is lost. But someone who has lower back pain, for example, it's a very subjective measure.” Additionally, she said, cultural differences in how people express their pain and how doctors register that expression, can impact pain management care as well.

Mason-Cooley says no matter how she expresses her pain, she runs the risk of being dismissed.

“There’s so much judgment. If you're too calm, then they say, ‘Oh, you're not sick. You don't look sick.’ And then if you're crying and moaning, they say you're exaggerating. I don’t really know what they want from us,” she said, exasperated.

This particularly impacts people suffering from diseases like sickle cell disease, which almost exclusively affects Black people, or fibromyalgia, lupus and endometriosis — diseases that are often misdiagnosed and misunderstood.

Medicine’s history of bias

Medicine has a history of bias, the vestiges of which we are still grappling with today.

A 2016 study found that nearly half of first and second year medical students believed that Black people have thicker skin than white people, and perceived Black people as experiencing less pain than white people, an idea born from 19th century experiments that were conducted by a physician named Thomas Hamilton. He was a wealthy plantation owner who regularly tortured an enslaved Black man named John Brown, creating blisters all over his body in an effort to prove Black skin went deeper than white skin.

A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine analyzed data from 14 previously published studies on pain management and found that Black patients were 40% less likely to receive medication for acute pain compared to white patients, and 34% less likely to be prescribed opioids.

“The field of medicine was very complicit historically in racial categorization and biological concepts of race,” said Sabin. Medicine’s role in espousing biological differences between Black and white people laid the foundation for justifying slavery and the inhumane treatment of Black people. Dr. James Marion Sims, known as the founding father of gynecology, conducted experimental surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia, developing a body of work that continues to misrepresent how Black women experience pain.

The slavery-era belief that Black people were hypersexual and simultaneously less intelligent than white people also continues to impact the care that Black women get.

""With Black women there is an assumption that they don't know their bodies, that they don't understand, that they're not educated about their bodies,” Dr. Colene Arnold, a gynecologist who specializes in pelvic pain disorders, told New Hampshire Public Radio’s The Exchange podcast. She pointed to a study that found Black women are less likely to be diagnosed for endometriosis than white women when they were experiencing pelvic pain, and instead, misdiagnosed as having pelvic inflammatory disease, which is typically sexually transmitted.

“When we look at patient testimonies, particularly from Black women ... We're seeing that these typical tropes of Black women are used ... that they are hypersexualized and that if they have some sort of illness or pain, that it's likely self-inflicted in a sense that they did something wrong,” Keisha Ray, an assistant professor at the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics in Houston, Texas, told The Exchange.

'I'm here because I'm sick'

In another pain crisis just last year, Mason-Cooley recalls being left in a hospital waiting room for 10 hours until she passed out from pain, only to wake up to a nurse telling her, ""This isn’t a pain clinic,” implying that she was seeking drugs.

“I have straight up told doctors and nurses, ‘If I wanted it to get high, I could do it on the streets for cheaper, with less judgment. I’m here because I’m sick,’” Mason-Cooley said.

Others on Mason-Cooley’s Facebook thread posted about experiencing pain in the middle of the night and forcing themselves to wait until the morning to go to the hospital, because they knew a 2 a.m. trip to the emergency room for severe pain would only result in accusations that they are addicts. It’s a lot of added stress to deal with when you’re struggling with intense pain.

And having untreated pain can have long-term physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Additionally, say the authors of the 2019 study, pain that’s dismissed causes patients to have less trust in the medical system. That was what Sevon Blake, a 29-year-old Black baker in Queens, New York, experienced.

“I used to have a lot of lower abdominal pain, and I brought up the concern to my doctor multiple times. He would say, “‘It's probably just a little gas, you’re fine’, and just kind of like brush under the rug.”

""... It's gotta stop. We're asking you to listen to us.""

Blake switched from her Asian male doctor to a Black female doctor who took her concerns seriously. Her new doctor listened to her, discussed her options and eventually referred her to a gastroenterologist. It turns out Blake has a gluten intolerance, an issue that was managed with dietary changes. “I didn’t feel like I could talk to my previous doctor, if he was just going to dismiss me, then I’m not going to be proactive and tell him what I’m feeling.”

Mason-Cooley, a vocal advocate for the sickle cell community who spoke on Capitol Hill about the disease in 2018, said all she wants is to be heard.

“I don't want to undermine any doctor or any nurse because it’s a noble job,” she said. “But I know people with sickle cell that have actually died from a heart attack because the pain was so excruciating. No one took it seriously and they passed away. So it's gotta stop. We're asking you to listen to us. We just want to be treated the way you would want your own family treated.”"

While she liked helping people, it was tough. Every day she listened to callers recount trauma as she faced racism and microaggressions from co-workers. The job was daunting and overwhelming.

She started seeing a therapist to help. But when her therapist retired, she just stopped going. Finding a new therapist felt like an extra worry.

“All of the real-world things that are going on is affecting me, of course, as a Black woman,” the 38-year-old government employee who lives in Pittsburgh told TODAY. “That's a lot to deal with.”

On top of feeling depressed by systemic racism she faces, Parrish’s concerns about her family adds to it. She frets about her sons, who are 10 and 6, because of police brutality, racism and other factors that put them at greater risk. And, her partner is in jail and it doesn’t seem like he will be paroled soon for his DUI conviction, even though he served his sentence, she said.

“It’s a major stressor. I have two Black boys and their father is in prison,” Parrish said. “I work very hard. I shouldn’t have to put up with this extra stuff.”

The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health collects some data on Black women and mental health but it isn’t entirely complete, explains Mia Moore Kirby, an assistant professor in the social work department and center of African American studies at University of Texas, Arlington. While African Americans experience mental illness at the same rate as other Americans, they're more likely to receive inadequate care or no care at all. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that one out of every three Black people who need mental health treatment actually receives it.

“There’s no specific information on how many people have diagnoses just because so many people go untreated — and this is for all groups,"" Kirby told TODAY.

Or put another way: “There are pieces of information. But can we speak to the experience of Black women when it comes to health and mental health issues? It's difficult to do that,"" said Cortney Beasley, founder of Put In Black, an online community focused on Black people and mental health, and a therapist at a start-up in San Francisco Bay area, told TODAY.

Barriers to help

Black women are often underrepresented in research and wary of seeking mental health treatment. The reasons behind both sometimes overlap.

“The mistrust that Black people feel towards our health care system ... and the stigma that comes along with mental health issues and going to therapy … it's all been designed in a way that's not really conducive to Black people getting the help they need,” Beasley said.

Medicine has a tragic history of forced experiments on Black people, including the Tuskegee Study and the case of Henrietta Lacks, when doctors took cells from Lacks without her or her family’s permission and used them for research and profited from it. Today, Black women often feel wary about participating in research. Yet, other research simply doesn’t consider Black women.

“Some researchers don't research people of color and then also there's concern associated with us volunteering for studies,” Kirby said. “It's an issue on both sides.”

There’s also a history of social workers (and therapists) recording information to be used against Black women.

Fewer than 5% of psychologists are Black. Even if everyone in the country wanted a Black therapist there wouldn’t be enough of us to go around. Joy Harden Bradford

“I also think that some of that has to do with how social workers — which were the original mental health folks in Black communities — were introduced,” LaNail Plummer, CEO and clinical director of Onyx Therapy Group in Washington, D.C., told TODAY. “In those situations, the social worker, who was the middle person, actually gathered information and that information was later used against the client.”

In addition to structural barriers and systemic racism, many Black women struggle to find a therapist who looks like them — or is culturally competent.

“Fewer than 5% of psychologists are Black. Even if everyone in the country wanted a Black therapist there wouldn’t be enough of us to go around,” Joy Harden Bradford, a psychologist based in Atlanta, Georgia and founder of Therapy for Black Girls, told TODAY.

At 62 years old, Karen Walker is now seeing a Black therapist and she said it’s made a huge difference.

“My treatment now is much better,” the retired nurse’s aide in Pittsburgh, told TODAY. “(My therapist) can respond back to me because of her experiences, real life things that have happened to her and we can talk about it and work things out.”

Walker feels like her therapist now has a “different approach” and makes her want to return. Sometimes when Black women ask for help they feel like they’re not getting the best care or being dismissed. Kirby studied the “strong Black woman” stereotype’s role in mental health and found that it prevents women from receiving care.

“The 'strong black woman concept' (implies that) we're able to handle all things and so sometimes clinicians — who may not be culturally competent — may also speak that language,” Kirby said. “That’s not validating a person's experience, not empathizing with what's going on and maybe minimizing their symptoms. And I think African American women in particular have symptoms minimized. We're looked at as superhuman.”

Marissa Carrington, 27, feels this pressure to be everything. She works for a grassroots organization that focuses on restorative justice practices and conflict resolution. She has two children and recently learned one of her daughters has anxiety and impulse control disorder. In addition, friends and family rely on her to help with their problems. Many days, Carrington felt overwhelmed and mad.

Since paying attention to her mental health, Marissa Carrington feels happier and even uses some of the skills she's learned to help her navigate tricky parenting situations. Courtesy Marissa Carrington

“Basically, my attitude was kind of nasty. Just the things that I have been through made me angry,” she told TODAY. ""I'm just ready to be happy so I just wanted to work on myself.""

Creating space for Black women’s mental health

Carrington attends a program, Beams to Bridges, offered by the Pittsburgh-based Black mental health group Steel Smiling, and feels much happier and even better able to cope with parenting stress. The one-year program teaches ""Mental Health First Aid"" but also destigmatizes mental health. Parrish also attends and even found a new therapist to help her grapple with parenting alone but not being a single parent. Shanell Ware, another participant, feels grateful to have joined when she did. Watching recent videos featuring police brutality has caused her to relive her traumatic experience when police officers choked her during a traffic stop in 2008.

“When it comes up, it brings up the pain,” the 36-year-old, assistant manager at a cleaning company told, TODAY. “I had never spoken out loud about it. My therapist was the first person I expressed how I felt.”

Ware realized being “bottled up with hurt and pain” made her lash out at loved ones. Since seeing her therapist and working with Steel Smiling she now knows how to manage stress better. If she feels anxious or angry, she starts singing or slowly counts in her head until it passes. And, she’s also become a mental health advocate in her community. That’s one of the goals of Beams to Bridges: To end stigma around mental health in the Black community and bolster community support.

“They are making referrals and connecting their friends and families and really being mental health champions,” Julius Boatwright, CEO of Steel Smiling, told TODAY. “They are mental health support in action.”

Steel Smiling offers a Black Mental Health Fund that's available nationwide to defray treatment costs. Requests quickly came in for help.

""People do need support,"" Boatwright said. ""What we would love to see is Black people all across the country being community mental health ... champions. And this is supporting more traditional mental health (professionals).""

Plummer says Steel Smiling, which she works with, help Black people access services they need.

“The community-based companies are doing all the legwork that needs to get done in order to bring people into counseling,” she said. “They get people relaxed so that they can come into counseling.”

Steel Smiling also introduces Black people to therapists who look like them and coaches them on interviewing therapists.

Nationally, Therapy for Black Girls provides a database of more than 1,000 providers so that Black women can find Black therapists.

“There are certain things that you can likely talk with a Black woman therapist about as another Black woman that you won't have to explain twice,” Harden Bradford explained. “There are sadly micro-aggressions that exists even in the therapy space.”

Another national organization, The Loveland Foundation, provides support to Black girls and women to attend therapy. Its therapy fund allows them four to eight therapy sessions with culturally competent providers across the country and partners with Therapy for Black Girls among others. Actress Taraji P. Henson also started the Boris L. Henson Foundation, which aims to destigmatize mental health in the African American community and provide scholarships to Black people pursuing mental health careers. It's currently raising money to offer up to five virtual therapy sessions at a lower cost for people undergoing additional stress during these unprecedented times.

Harden Bradford also hosts a podcast about mental health. Not every episode focuses on illness or trauma — some examine mental health in pop culture — but other address complex issues, such as postpartum depression, self-care after sexual assault and recovering from an abortion, to name a few. She’s learned that the podcast had an impact that she never anticipated.

“People will use episodes of the podcast as a lead in for some difficult conversations,” she said. “If you don't necessarily have the language (around mental health) it could be that you share the podcast episode and ... have a conversation.”

107,,https://www.today.com/specials/how-systemic-racism-affects-black-women-s-health/index.html,From the cradle to the grave: How systemic racism affects Black women's health,"For more than 91 days, Danielle Bridges cared for her two children while dealing with excruciating knee pain after her doctor failed to treat her injury. Her knee was swollen and hot to the touch, an injury from taekwondo. She had gone to her in-network doctor, noticing her knee appeared filled with fluid and was unable to bend, but he minimized her pain. “The doctor even slapped me on the injured knee to prove it wasn’t so bad,” she said. Ultimately, she went home with crutches, no pain medication, no further tests and advice not to put too much weight on it. It wasn’t until about 3 months later that he finally did an MRI, she said. “Then, he called me sheepishly stating there was quite a bit of damage, including a torn ACL.”

Bridges already had anxiety regarding doctors and hospitals. When she was pregnant with her first child, the OB-GYN she was seeing never looked her directly in her face, she said, and he insisted she must have known who the father of her child was even after she explained she used a sperm donor. She asked that a different doctor in the practice attend her child’s birth, and, ultimately, that doctor ignored her birth plan and all of her wishes. “She pushed me into induction and insisted I could not give birth naturally,” said Bridges. “It made me feel depressed and like I am not strong or capable. I am Black and pregnant with no father. Everything I wanted was pushed aside.”

It starts at birth

Black infants are also almost four times more likely than white infants to die from health complications caused by low birth weight. Black infants are also almost four times more likely than white infants to die from health complications caused by low birth weight.

Her story, unfortunately, is not uncommon among Black women. The dismissal of Black women’s health concerns is just one factor in a set of racial health disparities that begin at birth. Babies born to Black mothers are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday. Before they even leave the hospital, Black newborns — who are more likely than white babies to be born prematurely — receive less nursing care in the NICUs of our nation’s hospitals. Black infants are also almost four times more likely than white infants to die from health complications caused by low birth weight, which is the leading cause of infant death. Across all socioeconomic statuses, Black women are about three times more likely than white women to die from preventable birth-related complications.

""It’s racism — not race — that affects Black women’s health."" Dr. Kiarra King, OB/GYN

“It's really important that people understand the historical context behind why racism affects medicine,” Dr. Kiarra King, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, told TODAY. Citing J. Marion Sims, known as the father of gynecology, King explained that modern women’s health care was developed, without consent, on the bodies of Black women. Sims experimented on enslaved Black women without pain medication, and the idea that Black people feel less pain persists today. It’s racism, not race, that affects Black women’s health, she said.

The physical and mental health effects are unavoidable

The harmful strong Black woman stereotype leaves Black women unprotected — exerting energy fighting the very things putting their own mental health at risk. The harmful strong Black woman stereotype leaves Black women unprotected — exerting energy fighting the very things putting their own mental health at risk.

All racist experiences, whether medical, interpersonal or institutional, add up and equal a life full of frequent, persistent stress for Black women. Studies show this toxic stress promotes an inflammatory response in the body at the cellular level — the same inflammation at the root of preeclampsia, hypertension, dementia and other chronic conditions that Black women are at higher risk of having or dying from. Premature death, before the age of 75, is more common in Black people than Hispanic and white people. The health inequities are startling, and the mental health effects of stress causted by racism are unavoidable.



“This country was founded on racist practices. “It should be no surprise that medicine also has racist practices — racism was built into the institution of medicine."" Dr. Kiarra King, OB/GYN

Just a single exposure to real-life police violence against a Black person, whether on social media or TV, is enough to cause stress, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms. Just a single exposure to real-life police violence against a Black person, whether on social media or TV, is enough to cause stress, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms.

When police violence and racism claim the lives of Black people, Black women grieve and take the front lines in the fight for equality. The harmful strong Black woman stereotype, that Black women are resilient and inherently stronger than other women, leaves Black women unprotected. Exerting energy fighting the very things putting their own mental health at risk, Black women often become sacrificial lambs to racism. The chronic stress of racism is trying and leaves Black women prone to depression and other mental illnesses.

Due to stigma, distrust of the health care system and lack of access to culturally competent care, Black women are half as likely to seek mental health treatment as white women. The videos of George Floyd and other Black people being murdered and brutalized by police officers is a major source of stress. Just a single exposure to real-life police violence against a Black person, whether on social media or TV, can cause stress, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms like hypervigilance in Black Americans — and studies are just beginning to crack the surface on the way these experiences affect the health of Black people. One thing is clear: centuries of racism have weathered the bodies of Black women.

A double whammy in the doctor’s office: Gender and racial bias

According to the CDC, Black women die from breast cancer at a rate 40% higher than white women. According to the CDC, Black women die from breast cancer at a rate 40% higher than white women.

Of course, gender bias influences the care and pain management women are given, but Black women face both gender and racial bias. “There have been studies that have revealed that medical students and doctors believe Black people have a higher pain tolerance than non-Black people, which has over time led to them thinking Black people presenting with pain were drug-seeking,” said King. Myths that Black people have thicker skin and feel less pain drive inadequate pain management where Black people reporting pain tend to be 22% less likely to be prescribed pain medications.

Bridges’ story is echoed in the stories of Black women across America who have spent too many days in pain — dismissed, disempowered and denied the care they thought the health care system was there to give.

These experiences are traumatic, but more importantly, they’re often fatal. One very shocking example of this disparity is breast cancer. Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer but more likely to die from it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Black women die from breast cancer at a rate 40% higher than white women. The CDC explains that doctors are more likely to find breast cancer at an earlier stage among white women than they do for Black women.

Myths that Black people feel less pain result in inadequate pain management where Black people reporting pain tend to be 22% less likely to be prescribed pain medications. Myths that Black people feel less pain result in inadequate pain management where Black people reporting pain tend to be 22% less likely to be prescribed pain medications.

The list of racial health disparities is long, and systemic racism is at the root of them. “This country was founded on racist practices,” said King. “It should be no surprise that medicine also has racist practices — racism was built into the institution of medicine.”

For Black people, racism continues to result in unequal access to economic opportunities and ultimately unequal access to high-quality health care and insurance. The effects of racism and gender bias on mental and physical health cannot be ignored, and the importance of listening to and taking care of Black women when it comes to their health cannot be denied.

Depending on the context, the word can mean either a surgical tool, ""Sims' vaginal speculum,"" or its inventor, Dr. James Marion Sims. Sims is known as the founding father of gynecology, but his legacy is fraught because of how he gathered much of his learnings — by operating on enslaved Black women without their consent or anesthesia.

Today, Phillips is ""reclaiming"" this story, she told TODAY. She prefers to call the tool ""Lucy.""

Lucy was an enslaved 18-year-old who almost died after Sims operated on her, attempting to fix her postpartum urinary incontinence, according to the Journal of the National Medical Association.

Phillips recalled feeling ""shocked, appalled and disappointed,"" when she first learned about Sims' history over 10 years ago. In that moment, she said it was ""a no-brainer"" to stop using his name.

Dr. Kameelah Philipps refers to the Sims' surgical speculum as ""Lucy,"" after an enslaved woman Dr. J. Marion Sims experimented on. provided

""(Sims) wasn’t going to hold space in my (operating room),"" she said. ""His instrument ... was developed off the pain of women who looked like me.""

The disturbing history of Dr. J. Marion Sims

In 2017, the name ""J. Marion Sims"" made headlines when someone spray-painted the word ""racist"" on his statue in New York City's Central Park, amid nationwide calls to remove monuments to people with ties to the Confederacy.

The following spring, city officials took down Sims' statue. Shortly after, Sims' name fell out of the national conversation and was again relegated to medical textbooks and classrooms, where his story is rarely told in full.

""Lots of people don’t know about it, but (that's) not a mistake,"" Phillips explained. ""When people of color and women have our stories selectively removed from history books, why would I expect people to know about it?""

Renaming the Sims' speculum

In recent weeks, multiple online petitions have been launched to rename medical devices named after Sims; so far, at least 10,000 people have signed them.

Phillips has been calling the device ""Lucy"" for over a decade, but occasionally she needs to tell a new surgical tech what ""Lucy"" refers to, and a history lesson usually follows.

""It’s an opportunity for education and enlightenment,"" she said. ""Most of us throughout the day don’t think about these names, the things (Sims) has done, what he represents.""

Lucy is one of three women who Sims experimented on whose names we know. The others are Anarcha and Betsey, but there are at least a dozen more, Bettina Judd, Ph.D., assistant professor at University of Washington, who wrote a book on the history of medical experimentation on Black women, told TODAY.

In addition to creating an early version of the speculum, Sims is credited with the current procedure to repair vesicovaginal fistulas, a postpartum condition where urine leaks through the vagina. To gather this knowledge, he'd operate upwards of 20 times on a single patient, who'd be on all fours, Judd said.

Some of Sims' supporters say the women were in extreme pain and wanted the procedures. But Judd disagreed with this justification, explaining that the enslaved women didn't have the option to say no.

Others insist Sims was a product of his time, to which Judd answered, ""Whose time are we imagining when we say that? We’re imagining that time depends on racist, white men. We’re imagining that slaves didn’t think it was wrong they were enslaved. Even among his peers, there were plenty of dissenters.""

""Sims understood enslaved women not to have the same pain threshold as white women,"" Judd continued. ""Through his texts and medical practice, you can see how he enacted that, (conducting) these horrendous experiments on Black women.""

Sims also experimented on enslaved infants, according to medical journal Social History of Medicine. Searching for a cure for neonatal tetanus, he thought the baby's skull shape could be the cause, so he used an awl (a pointed tool for piercing holes) to forcibly align the bones. The procedure was fatal.

Sims' legacy now

According to Judd, Sims' legacy continues not just through instruments and procedures, but biases still held by medical professionals.

For example, research from 2016 found that medical students and residents held ""false beliefs about biological differences between Blacks and whites,"" which ""predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy,"" the study stated.

As Judd explained it, ""The belief that Black folks, particularly Black women, are ... impervious to pain has a history. We're not just making it up.""

Other data highlights the apparent effects of such beliefs: NBC News reported in January that Black mothers are 2.5 times more likely to die in childbirth than whites. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released June 24 found that Black people represented 1 in 4 COVID-19 deaths, despite comprising 13% of the population.

Charles Johnson, a father of two, whose wife died after giving birth to their second child, told TODAY he thinks about Sims often. Kira Johnson, a 39-year-old Black woman, underwent a routine cesarean section in April 2016 and died several hours later of a postpartum, internal hemorrhage.

""When I found out about Dr. Sims, I was blown away that the ripples of his work are still so present in modern-day obstetrics,"" Johnson, who lives with his young boys in Atlanta, Georgia, said. ""I refuse to believe that, had (Kira) been caucasian, that this would've happened.""

Johnson's since created 4Kira4Moms, a foundation advocating for stronger maternal health regulations. He also believes telling Sims' full story is crucial to protect Black moms — but it's only ""the first step,"" he said.

How to create change in health care practices

Johnson, Judd and Phillips all proposed changing how medical schools educate students about racial bias as one strategy to achieve more equal health care outcomes.

""We need to teach these things about the history of the American medical profession and how it can have catastrophic effects. It has to be mandatory,"" Johnson said. ""You have to teach specific stories. It needs to be more than data. It needs to be real.""

Since the death of George Floyd, people are once more rejecting honoring Sims' legacy. The president of University of South Carolina, in Sims' home state, supports renaming a women's dorm called Sims. A recent petition demanded the removal of Sims' statue at the state capitol in Alabama, where he practiced.

Phillips said she's ""extremely humbled and proud"" of what's happening as more people learn about Lucy, Anarcha and Betsey.

""For me to be an African American, female physician ... I don't take it lightly that I'm now in a position to tell their stories that they weren't able to tell (because) they had no voice,"" she said.

This was updated on June 30, 2020, to reflect current petitions to rename medical devices named after Sims."
109,2020-07-17 20:32:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/black-dietitians-say-4-things-you-should-know-about-nutrition-t187200,4 things Black dietitians want you to know about nutrition and wellness,"A registered dietitian is a trained expert who helps people tailor the science of nutrition into useful solutions for healthier living — whether that’s losing weight or managing a specific health condition. But less than 3% of registered dietitians are Black — and just over 80% are white, which means that most of the nutrition information that gets disseminated across mainstream and social media comes from white practitioners. For the most part, this advice doesn’t take into account cultural differences or social conditions that affect a person’s health status.

Here’s what four Black dietitians want you to know about how these disparities are affecting the way we all view nutrition, why it really matters and what needs to change.

1. It’s not our fault.

There’s an idea that Black people are to blame for the health problems they experience, Maya Feller, a registered dietitian in Brooklyn, told TODAY. “I recently had someone tell me that Black people need to take responsibility for their health and eat vegetables,” she said. “It's important for us to understand that Americans across the board are not meeting the recommended intakes for vegetables — not just Black people. Yet, we continue to be told that it's our fault when the country at large is deficient.”

Valerie Agyeman, a women’s health dietitian and founder of Flourish Heights, shared a similar observation. “Research often suggests that there are higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in Black people,” she said, “and the sad truth is that they get blamed for it when in all actuality the health outcomes Black people face are linked to social determinants like socioeconomic status, employment, access to budget-friendly nutritious foods, health care and much more.”

In other words, it’s not a lack of willpower or a refusal to try; the real problem is that implicit biases (unconscious race-based stereotypes) in our health and social systems create health disparities and put Black people at higher risk of diseases. As Marisa Moore, a culinary and integrative dietitian in Atlanta, pointed out: “It would be a mistake to judge a person based on your own personal situation without fully understanding all that goes into the food choices and health status of Black people.”

2. The system needs work.

The ability to attain good health in the first place depends on a multitude of factors. Some of the factors that can make or break your health and well-being are:

Neighborhoods that have low crime rates, as well as parks, playgrounds, bike paths and sidewalks where you can safely stay active.

The availability of full-service grocery stores that are stocked with healthful and reasonably-priced foods.

Access to health services for screenings and interventions.

Well-funded public schools and employment opportunities that provide economic stability.

“Our communities tend to not only have fewer full-service grocery stores, more liquor stores and fast food outlets,” said Feller, “but we also have fewer safe spaces to engage in intentional physical activity. We have limited access to higher quality healthcare. We are over-policed and violently punished at astonishing rates. We have lower incomes — and tend to live in underperforming school districts.” Feller explained that when it comes to nutrition, health and dietitian advice, Black people aren’t just significantly disadvantaged, they’re literally being left behind. She noted that environmental conditions like these exacerbate high rates of chronic illnesses, driving 80% of health outcomes, and that it’s a vicious cycle. “Being trapped within a cycle increases the likelihood that the next generation will face the same roadblocks,” she said.

It’s inappropriate to talk about health problems in Black communities without mentioning these social and environmental problems. “Our language is the biggest issue here,” said Vanessa Rissetto, a registered dietitian at Culina Health in Hoboken, New Jersey. She explained that when we say things like Black people have a propensity towards obesity, we make it sound as though by being Black, you are going to be obese. “We leave out the social issues, such as Black people have lack of access, they are not treated the same way whites are when they see practitioners, perhaps there are language barriers or financial issues,” she said. When we talk about health, we have to add this context.

3. There’s a narrow view of healthy eating.

Google healthy eating and you’ll see pages of images with veggies — mostly salads — being prepped or eaten by white people. On Instagram, the hashtag balanced diet looks similar, with a few smoothie and grain bowls thrown in. Is that what it means to eat healthfully? Black dietitians say no, and they challenge you to think more broadly about what to eat to be healthy.

“When we see images of healthy people, they’re exercising and eating a salad. This reinforces the idea that being healthy looks a specific way and is mostly for white people,” said Feller. Moore added that cultural foods are often demonized. “The truth is our traditional foods are actually quite healthy,” she said. “Greens, okra, sweet potatoes are just a few — and we also have to respect that food and culture are connected.""

Additionally, Moore indicated that our narrow view of healthy eating excludes many in the Black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) community. “If people are made to think they have to change to only eating brown rice, fresh and organic fruits and vegetables, drinking matcha lattes and going on exotic retreats to be healthy, while their greens and beans cooked with meat are labeled ‘bad,’ then healthy eating may seem inaccessible,” she said. “Giving up your cultural foods is not a prerequisite for health.”

Feller added that “when we begin to see images of people eating curries, dhals, tamales, pasteles, peas and rice, escovitch fish, soups and more, we will see that there are multiple ways to eat healthfully and that there are so many different faces and bodies that represent health.”

4. We need more diversity in the wellness space.

One of the biggest problems, said Feller, is that the media projects a one-size perspective. “The ideal body tends to be that of white, cis-gendered, able-bodied, thin and/or chiseled people,” she said.

Agyeman shared a similar viewpoint. “There is a lack of imagery in skin complexion, body shapes and even hair textures,” she said, adding that it’s critical for mainstream media to put more BIPOC at the forefront of wellness. “Healthy eating belongs to everyone — it is not one-sided.”"

How Black therapists are helping patients cope,"In March, as businesses across the country closed and the death rate from the new coronavirus climbed into the thousands, Dr. Jennifer Mullan, a psychologist in New Jersey, suddenly found herself busier than usual.

""I was working triple time,"" she said. ""I was inundated with calls from people I usually see on a weekly basis saying they needed to be seen immediately.""

Her clients in New York City who don't have washers and dryers in their apartments were panicking because laundromats in the city had closed. Others were worried because they had been showing symptoms of the virus but were turned away when they sought help at doctor's offices.

Then, in May, George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, launching weeks of protests against police brutality and racial injustice — and, for many Black Americans, bringing to the surface decades of racial trauma. Once again, Mullan's workload skyrocketed.

Many clients were bringing up the videos of police brutality they had watched on the news and on social media. The videos alone can be triggers, she said.

""Witnessing George Floyd screaming for his mother — that in itself can be extremely traumatic for many black-identifying Americans, because many people are saying, that could be my son, that could be my father,"" Mullan said.

""A lot of individuals I'm working with right now are feeling absolutely exhausted and burnt out, and consistently feeling like it is unsafe to leave the house,"" she added. ""Breonna Taylor was murdered in her bed. That is bringing trauma. People don't feel safe in their homes. There is that constant feeling of, could I be next?""

Dr. Richard Orbe-Austin, a psychologist in New York, said he too is hearing about the police killings from his clients.

“It is something that has been indeed very triggering,” he said. “Some of my clients have talked about the pain of seeing (those killings) and how it triggered particular feelings of anxiety and fear, or their own experiences of being stopped by the police.”

What is racial trauma?

Racial trauma is the cumulative effect of racism on someone's mental and physical health.

That includes direct acts of racism such as hate crimes or being discriminated against at work; systemic racism, which includes health disparities, pay inequity, lack of diversity and more; as well as microaggressions, which are more subtle acts of racism in the form of comments or questions that often perpetuate racial stereotypes.

Add all that to the recent police killings as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affects African American communities, and therapists aren't surprised that this moment in time is having a profound psychological effect on their Black patients.

What does racial trauma look like?

Racial trauma looks a lot like post-traumatic stress disorder, therapists said.

""The symptoms of PTSD are similar to how the trauma of racism shows up in people,"" said Brittney R. Cobb, a licensed clinical social worker in North Carolina, who runs the Instagram account @ablackfemaletherapist.

That means irritability, low self-esteem, poor concentration, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, anxiety and depression. And that psychological stress in turn can lead to physical health problems — hypertension, heart attacks, diabetes and obesity, for example, which are all disorders that disproportionately affect Black people.

Part of what therapists are doing is helping patients simply identify their own racial trauma and where it comes from.

“I think a lot of people might not understand that this is part of a larger system of systematic oppression,” Mullan said. “I really take time to break things down in tangible ways and say, ‘This is what historical trauma means.’”"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. for 2018 was 17.4 per 100,000 live births. Black women fare much worse: the rate skyrockets to 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live births. Breast cancer death rates are also 40% higher for Black women compared with their white counterparts. “Black women are dying four to five times the rate of anyone (else) in this country,” said Tracie Collins, the CEO and founder of the National Black Doulas Association (NBDA) based in Suwanee, Georgia. “The odds are stacked against us. The question is, where are you going to fall?”

There are a number of reasons for these horrific outcomes. Black women have inadequate access to high-quality health care. They’re less likely to be routinely monitored and more likely to receive delayed diagnoses and treatment, as well as subpar care, according to researchers at organizations like the National Research Council. Simply put, racism in health care puts Black women’s lives at risk. There have been innumerable accounts where Black women, including celebrities, have cited racism and bias in health care. Articles have been written substantiating these experiences — and providers within the health care community have called this out as a public health crisis.

Even as a young, well-educated Black woman, I am no exception to this. My first pregnancy took an unexpected turn. Midway through, I began experiencing significant pain and immediately went in for an appointment. I was told that the fibroid I had was decompensating and that it “might hurt,” then was sent home with pain medication. Within 24 hours, the pain transitioned to early labor. I was under the care of one of the most progressive and highly skilled obstetricians in New York City, yet my pregnancy ended with the death of my first child.

My treatment and care weren’t intentionally biased, I believe I was just seen as a first-time Black mom who was strong. The stereotype and cultural construct of “the strong Black woman” has detrimental ramifications. Additionally, implicit bias (a type of prejudice in which racial stereotypes are formed without conscious intention) allowed my care provider to discount my pain. On some level, I too had internalized the bias in the air and thought I could manage. I’ve talked to a number of white friends who’ve had similar experiences with different outcomes. The major difference? When they reported pain during pregnancy, most were admitted for further observation — and not sent home.

How can Black women get the OB/GYN care they need?

The NBDA’s Collins strongly recommends that Black women become drivers of their own health care. This includes researching care providers and knowing how to ask questions and get evidence-based responses. It involves understanding how to demand further medical support when a treatment or intervention is necessary. Collins also suggests that all patients document interactions with medical staff and care providers.

When looking for a new health care provider, Collins noted how important it is to understand your insurance coverage and whether (or to what extent) it’s accepted at the provider’s practice. “I would go even further to understand and know statistics within the facility and with providers,” she said.

Mya Walker, a mom from Brooklyn, said she prefers to seek out Black women for her OB/GYN care. “I feel that I want someone that I can really talk to, and more importantly, have someone who I feel may be more predispositioned to care about me or even just relate to any issue I may talk about.” She said that in her previous interactions with white male doctors, they were quick to categorize her and offer a generic treatment. I’ve heard many of my Black women friends express this concern before.

Black women are entitled to health care providers who will listen to them and assure them that their concerns are being heard — providers who will respond with care, compassion and evidence-based advice specific to their health needs and the needs of their family.

“From a clinical perspective, the number one criterion for any medical provider is, do they listen? And are they hearing you?” said Juliette Blount, a nurse practitioner and health equity speaker based in New York City. And by listening, Blount added, “are they listening and nodding, but in their head, they have already decided what they will prescribe?” Or is the provider actively listening and truly hearing the patient. “If they are hearing,” said Blount, “they should be asking questions and seeking clarification based on the listening that they’re doing. You (the patient) should feel relieved versus frustrated at the end of the interaction.”

How to make sure you’re really being heard

Whether or not we’re really being heard by our health care providers is one of the common themes that comes up in our community time and again. Simone Toomer, a Brooklyn-based certified doula and mom of two children, stressed the importance of seeking out individualized care and questioning: “Are (you) being heard — and listened to? Are questions being answered and not brushed off? Is evidence-based care (being) given?”

Toomer emphasized that providers should be referring Black women and their family members to specialists when needed. Patients also need to advocate for themselves, she said. “If, for whatever reason, you feel unheard or disrespected, especially in the Black community, we don’t have to make excuses for that treatment and can change OBs, midwives and pediatricians at any point.” When preparing to switch providers, Toomer said it’s important to request that copies of all medical records be forwarded to the new provider. Additionally, she noted that it may be challenging to change obstetricians after, say, 20 weeks of gestation, and the switch could result in increased out of pocket costs.

I personally gravitate toward health care providers who listen and ask questions when I describe an ailment or express a concern about one of my children. I am most comfortable with providers who are partners in my care, rather than ones who blindly diagnose and prescribe. I look for practitioners who know their craft well and understand when to refer out — and who are thoughtful and practice with humility.

For some, however, self-advocacy may be difficult, especially after repeated experiences of being marginalized. “I would encourage folks to harness their ego strengths and search (for providers) with the feeling that you are in charge of the course of your health,” said Nardia Brooks, a psychotherapist who serves mostly people of color in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn. When choosing an OB/GYN or pediatrician, Brooks said, “I would encourage strong advocacy for (your)self and (the) unborn child. Read, get your facts straight, have questions ready, interview as many OB/GYNs as your insurance, time and body allow. It’s your body, your child, your course.”

Taking the time and effort to find a provider that is in line with your values and one that you feel good about is well worth the effort."
112,2020-07-17 16:07:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/why-racism-can-have-long-term-effects-children-s-health-t186480,Why racism can have long-term effects on children's health,"Dr. Nia Heard-Garris was startled when her 4-year-old son came home from preschool one day and declared, “Mommy, sometimes I’m white.”

As a pediatrician who studies the impact of racism on children’s health and the mother of a Black boy with caramel skin, she carefully inquired further. He told her one of his friends said he only played with white kids.

“He just told the boy, ‘OK, I’m white today then.’ This kid was fine with that answer and let him play,” Heard-Garris, a pediatrics researcher at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, told TODAY.

“My No. 1 job as his parent is to keep him safe and try to help protect him from some of those things. However, the world is the world and I wasn’t expecting at 4, he would have to start to navigate these experiences.”

As kids get older, these experiences get more intense, said Heard-Garris, who wrote about the incident in JAMA Pediatrics. They may also do real damage.

Racism is a core social determinant of health that has a profound impact on the health of children, adolescents, young adults and their families, the American Academy of Pediatrics said in its first policy statement on the subject, issued in 2019 and citing 180 studies and papers.

“Racism harms children’s health, starting from before they are born,"" said Dr. Sally Goza, the AAP’s president, in June.

Toxic stress

Researchers studying the impact said it affects kids’ physical health, mental health and development.

When children are targets of racism, they experience chronic stress and are flooded with stress hormones like cortisol, leading to inflammatory reactions, noted Dr. Maria Trent, coauthor of AAP’s policy statement and a pediatrics professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.

This can harm kids’ health in the short term, “but also may create long-term problems like heart disease, diabetes and depression,” Trent wrote in an essay for Children’s Rights.

The mental health aspects of racism on children’s health may be better known, Heard-Garris said. That includes the impact of bias kids experience directly or second-hand — perhaps witnessing their parents being the targets — and the effects of both are similar, she noted.

Children’s exposure to discrimination was linked with higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, and decreased general health in a 2017 study.

It could lead to behavioral issues such as aggression and hostility, but also being withdrawn and feeling socially isolated, Heard-Garris said.

“The self-esteem is a part of it, and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Those tend to come out especially around events like we’re seeing now — feeling like the weight of the world is on your shoulders,” she noted.

Kids tell her, “Sometimes it feels like nothing will change. Sometimes it feels so big.”

Mistrust of health care system

There’s also the issue of unconscious bias in the health care system, which often unknowingly interacts with people of color differently than with other patients, said Dr. Ray Bignall, a pediatric nephrologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

He’s particularly concerned about how doctors and other health professionals interface with children in ways that are overtly or covertly racist, which leads to mistrust and delay in treatment. That, in turn, can lead to worse health outcomes for minority kids.

“There are many families who are very hesitant and skeptical of accessing pediatric care,” Bignall said.

“Every African-American person in the U.S., I would venture to guess, so many of us have a story about how the medical system didn’t listen to us or our family member.”

He recalled getting involved in the case of a Black boy with kidney disease whose chart contained complaints about his family not following through on doctors’ recommendations. Bignall’s white colleague had initially provided care, and when Bignall talked to the boy’s mother during a follow-up visit, she told him she almost didn’t come because the other doctor essentially threatened to call child protective services if she didn’t follow the care recommendations more consistently.

When Bignall asked his colleague about it, “the comment he made to me was, ‘I know that I can talk with them this way because we have such a good rapport that I feel like I could kind of light a fire underneath her to look after her kid better,’” Bignall recalled.

“It was such a striking dichotomy from the experience she had shared with me. It really underscores the challenge that a lot of Black patients have.”

Bignall didn’t know whether the other doctor would have said the same thing to a white family, but in his experience, there’s a different threshold for being proscriptive and less collaborative when dealing with ethnic minority families and those who come from a background of social disadvantage, he said.

When Bignall took over the boy’s care, he found out his father had recently died and the family didn’t have heat in their home in the middle of winter. The label “difficult family” in a child’s chart is sometimes a code word for a family that’s stressed out and struggling even before it has to deal with a sick kid, he said.

Other trends in Bignall’s medical field concern him as well. Black kids are disproportionately more likely to be born premature, which predisposes them to kidney disease, he said. A gene variant found in African-Americans may also play a role.

But if Black kids need specialist care or a kidney transplant, they’re referred for it later in the course of illness than other kids, he noted. “Is this because of physician bias? Or (patient) distrust of the medical system? We need to learn more,” Bignall noted. The delay means kids need dialysis sooner, exposing them to the increased morbidity associated with it.

Black children also wait longer to get a donor kidney and then when they do get it, it fails sooner, he said.

Long-lasting effects

Racism is a “socially transmitted disease,” the AAP policy statement noted. Teachers treating minority children differently and guidance counselors telling them they shouldn’t think about college — ""all of those things are still happening,"" which leads to those kids not feeling like they’re smart enough, Heard-Garris said.

The health impacts of racism in childhood are extremely long-lasting, added Dr. Monique Jindal, an internal medicine-pediatrics physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution.

“When we talk to adults about their experiences of racism, the number of times an adult will bring up an experience from childhood is so common, which just shows you how these experiences stick with you,” Jindal said.

She recalled watching Black kids wait in the emergency room of a hospital and be treated as if they don’t belong there. She said children tell her about hearing disparaging names and comments at school.

“(When) you’re constantly being told you’re not good enough and not valued, there’s this constant internalized racism where you start to believe these things that people say about you. It affects how a child develops their own identity,” Jindal said.

Every African-American person in the U.S., I would venture to guess, so many of us have a story about how the medical system didn’t listen to us or our family member. Dr. Ray Bignall, pediatric nephrologist at Nationwide Children

“They can internalize it. But then also we’ve seen it can affect what a kid believes they’re capable of doing.”

She recalled treating a 13-year old Black boy who had been assaulted in his neighborhood. After a week in the hospital, he returned because he wasn’t feeling well. Jindal thought it was related to his initial injury, but it turned out he had so much anxiety about what had happened to him that he developed chest pain.

“I asked him, ‘Do you feel safe? How are you feeling?’ And he said, ‘Nobody in the hospital ever asked me that,’” she recalled. “Nobody asked him if he was OK, what his plans were, if he was going to be safe when he went home.”

What can be done:

All of the experts were hopeful this moment in time was an opportunity for change since people are paying attention to the issue.

There are ways for parents and pediatricians to play an important role. Babies as young as 3 months old can notice the difference in skin color; at age 5, children start to know what’s fair and unfair; and by 12, some children even become set in their beliefs, Jindal said. That’s why it’s important to talk about race with kids.

“Kids are soaking up everything that’s around them and that includes these experiences of racism,” she noted. “Ask them questions, what they do and don’t notice, what they think about that. Kids are very honest creatures, they’ll tell you almost anything.”

“It’s important to talk about differences in race, skin color and all those things because kids are seeing them,” added Heard-Garris.

Meanwhile, pediatricians should be sensitive to the racism children experience and create a medical practice where all families feel welcomed, the AAP noted in its recommendations. When kids report experiencing racism, pediatricians should evaluate their mental health, including signs of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, grief and depression.

The health care field should be more diverse, Bignall said. Black people make up about 13% of the U.S. population, but 5% of doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Latinos make up about 18% of the U.S. population, but less than 6% of physicians.

It means that during training in medical school, residencies and fellowships, there’s a lack of diverse perspectives that allow physicians of other backgrounds to better understand how to take care of minority children, Bignall noted.

“Non-white patients should not require a race-matched provider to receive a standard of care that is equitable and dignified,” wrote Dr. Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay Area, in The Lancet in 2019.

Bignall and Heard-Garris also supported policy changes addressing everything from inclusion to food and housing insecurity.

“If we put a Band-Aid on a really big problem… then this problem is just going to keep coming up,” Heard-Garris said. “Kids unfortunately will bear the brunt of it.”"

In 2018, she became one of the first Black female professors of neurosurgery in the U.S. Many people believed in her along the way, but she has seen first-hand how race and racism can impact a doctor’s and a patient’s experience. She shared her story with TODAY.

Dr. Odette Harris was born in Jamaica and came to the U.S. as a child. Terrence McCarthy / Stanford University

The first and most powerful person certain of my success was my father. He nicknamed me “Star” as a kid.

I wanted to be many things, including a doctor, as far back as 8th grade, but my love of neuroscience blossomed in college. I had the world’s most amazing mentors. They created for me and allowed the most incredible opportunities to gain access to the field.

My mentors were not diverse — look at our field. Women and African-Americans are woefully underrepresented in the neurosciences. There were not a lot of people on my path who would represent a diversity of backgrounds — races, gender and ethnicity. But it’s testament that someone doesn’t need to look like you or come from the same background as you to be able to add beneficially to your path.

I definitely had naysayers. They come in so many different forms and can be truly detrimental to one’s psyche. The most lingering incidents in my memory came from people who didn’t even know who you were.

My husband jokes that my memoir should be titled, “No, I’m Not From Maryland” because of the number of times when I’ve had the “Odette Harris, MD” name card in a meeting and someone asked, “Oh, are you from Maryland?” Something as absurd as putting the initials of your state next to your name seems more plausible than the fact that “MD” stands for doctor. I can’t even tell you how many people ask that.

One time I was at an all-day meeting. There were only a dozen people at the table and I stood up to take a break at the back of the room. I was stretching my legs and one of the participants came over to ask me if I was going to be setting up for lunch. He truly mistook me for a member of the wait staff. This is somebody who I had been at a table with for five hours in intense discussions. There’s nothing more affirming that you are invisible. I felt immediately demoralized and my contributions felt devalued.

Another time, I was the keynote speaker and I was outside waiting for my car at valet and a person came up gave me their keys to valet park their car.

I was once scrubbing to go into the operating theater before surgery and the guy who was in charge of having people clean the rooms came up to ask me to clean a room. And I just said, “I will when I’m done with this case.”

In my experience, if you’re Black and a woman, nothing else is visible. Not the scrubs, not the suit, not the location, not the name and credentials — none of that matters if you’re blinded by that attribute.

Hospitals tend to be places where people are in existential moments in their lives — you don’t know what patients are carrying on their shoulders — so sometimes in stress, people revert to lesser versions of themselves. But when it comes from colleagues, it’s harder to process that.

Taken aback by loved one’s experience

My father was at a well-known hospital in New York. They saved his life, but I can tell you that race 100% factored into his care. I once got a call from a social worker who described my father as “non-compliant with his medications.” When you use words like that, you paint a picture of the patient that is deleterious to the record and ultimately to the health care that’s rendered.

My father had an attendant so all of his medications were given on schedule and he was not non-compliant. So I challenged her and asked, “What did you base that on?” What came out of the conversation was, “Well, just looking at him, he seems to be someone who wouldn’t be compliant.”

My father needed to be seen by a specialist in follow-up, but he was sent to the general clinic. I called to speak to the social worker to assess why he wouldn’t be seeing the specialist and was told the clinic is for those who are not insured. But my father is dually insured. The signifier of race is so powerful that they don’t even bother to check his insurance status — not that it should matter, by the way.

He was somehow ineligible for the specialty clinic because he was “uninsured” — but he wasn’t uninsured. The assumption was that here’s an elderly Black man who’s been hospitalized who is not compliant, per the chart, so what difference does it make what clinic we put him in? It’s 100% detrimental to his care, 100% detrimental to the care of individuals. I 100% believe it happens constantly. My father didn’t tell people his daughter was a doctor. He was going through these health care scenarios just as a person and the disparity in treatment was extreme.

I’m hopeful about the trajectory of things now only in the sense that I’m an extreme optimist.

From a realist standpoint, I remain concerned. When we’re on the other side of this movement, what are the repercussions, if any? We’ve had women in medical school classes at very high rates and yet we’ve not seen that trickle in terms of leadership — the number of deans, chief operating officers, chairs. We’re not seeing those numbers be representative and that’s just with gender.

But without hope, my life, my path, my journey, my accomplishments would not even exist. Because I had to be able to see what was unseen and I had to be able to hope in what I hadn’t seen before.

The Brooklyn mother-to-be posed for a photo from her bed at Woodhull Medical Center in New York on July 2. Her face mask was pulled down to her chin so the camera could capture her joyful smile.

Washington, 26, was a few days past her due date when went to the hospital for a routine stress test. After some observation, doctors noticed her blood pressure was high and gave Washington a drug to induce labor. She was asked if she wanted an epidural and after some hesitation, according to her family, she agreed.

Her boyfriend, Juwan Lopez, was on FaceTime with his mother, Desiree Williams, when the situation took a turn for the worse.

""The next thing you know he’s waiting there and they start running her down the hallway to the operating room,” Williams told Rolling Stone. ""He’s just screaming, ‘What happened? What happened?’ And nobody’s answering. Then somebody said the baby’s heart rate started dropping.""

Washington went into cardiac arrest while doctors delivered baby via c-section. Washington was pronounced dead after doctors spent 45 minutes trying to save her with CPR. Her newborn daughter, Khloe, was healthy.

Washington's death is shedding light on the racial disparities Black women face when giving birth.

In 2018, 658 women died of maternal causes in the U.S. A recent study showed Black women had a death rate of 40.8 per 100,000 births, three times higher than the rate of white women. American Indian and Native Alaskan women had the next highest rate at 29.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, more than double the rate in white women.

Experts have cited several reasons for the disparities, including systemic and institutional racism within the healthcare system, underlying health conditions more common in Black mothers and access to prenatal care.

Washington's family is now asking for justice. A GoFundMe page has now raised more than $88,000 to help with funeral costs and to support Lopez, who is now raising Khloe as a single father.

""WOODHULL HOSPITAL KILLED SHAASIA GIVING HER A EPIDURAL PLEASE HELP US GET JUSTICE,"" said a description on the fundraiser page.

It also comes three months after Amber Rose Isaac, 26, died at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx after she tweeted her concerns about the care she had been getting from the hospital.

Amy Schumer is also using her platform to speak out about the cases.

""We need to wake up and do better every day,"" she wrote, alongside gorgeous pregnancy photos Washington and Lopez took together as they eagerly awaited the birth of Khloe.

Washington's family also wants to raise awareness about what happened to her and the other Black women who died in childbirth. Last Thursday, they gathered outside Woodhull Medical Center, where one life was cut short and another had just started, to demand justice. They were joined by friends and a group of New York City doulas.

""She just started her family. Just got her own apartment to be on her own,"" Washington's future sister-in-law, Jasmin Lopez wrote on the fundraiser page. ""If you know Sha-Asia she wanted to be a mom and she was gonna be an amazing one."""

Chapman uses an acronym to break down a set of skills using cognitive behavioral therapy to manage strong emotions through the re-entry process: FIGHT, as in fight COVID-19 anxiety.

F: Focus on what you can control.

While there’s a lot of uncertainty associated with COVID-19, and anxiety and uncertainty go hand in hand, he said, there are actually a number of elements we can control. Those include how much media coverage we allow ourselves to watch and how much we talk about it. We can also control the things we can do in our immediate environment, and we can follow CDC guidelines as it relates to social distancing. This focus will give us a sense of control and predictability, he said, that will help us manage anxiety much more effectively.

I: Identify negative thoughts

While negative thoughts are inevitable right now, those that are catastrophic in nature, or that are predictive — as in ‘this is going to happen to me’ or ‘I know that this won't end anytime soon,’ create intense emotions, Chapman said. An important skill is to identify those negative thoughts and recognize that they contribute to maintaining strong emotions.

G: Generate alternative thoughts

This isn’t about positive thoughts, necessarily, Chapman explained, but coming up with more flexible thoughts. “It's not a ‘you got this, attaboy’ sort of thing. What if you feel like you don’t got this?”

He recommends coming up with what he calls a retrieval cue, something that reminds you to remain in uncomfortable situations. That can be an image or a small statement — Chapman likes to use an anchor. “It's a reminder of being flexible, being present, not escaping, that triggers the brain to recall the right things to do and say in that situation, and helps you remain.”

“I create a hierarchy of social situations that are uncomfortable, identify my thoughts in advance, and then become more flexible in those thoughts,” he explained. That cue “reminds me of anxiety being harmless, of anxiety being adaptive and helpful, and I ride the wave as opposed to fleeing.”

H: Highlight adaptive behaviors

Chapman recommends finding behaviors you can engage in to help navigate strong emotions. That could be exercise, mindfulness, and meditation, or connecting with family and friends even if it’s via technology.

A critical adaptive behavior is anchoring in the present, he said. Say you’re in a crowded subway car and feel anxiety rising, a technique to use in the moment is breathing in through the nose for four seconds and out through the mouth for six. “That stimulates heart lung synchronization, so now you're anchored and grounded in the present moment,’ he said. “And then you do what I call a three point check: What am I thinking right now? What am I feeling in my body right now? What am I doing, or feel like doing right now — and it might be I feel like peacing out and escaping immediately. Well, am I reacting to what's happening right now, or to a future path? The bottom line is, I need to respond to what's happening in the present moment.”

Following the situation, ask yourself what you learned, Chapman said. “Your brain learns a new non-threatening association despite how you feel in that context. So it's not about stress reduction. It's about learning something new, learning that I can tolerate discomfort, learning that this sky isn't actually going to crack and learning that it might be better than I expected it to be.”

T: Teach

Arguably the most important element is to teach someone else to do the same thing, Chapman said. “We're all in this fight together. If we band together and use the same skills and strategies. I think that we will make it through together.”"
116,2020-05-04 13:29:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/why-am-i-so-tired-unfocused-working-home-during-quarantine-t180638,"Exhausted, tired and unfocused while you're working from home?","I should be nailing this working-from-home thing these days. I’ve been based in a home office for years, so I’m not adjusting to Zoom meetings or missing my colleagues. My kids are self-sufficient. I’m not sick or caring for anyone who’s sick. With gyms and restaurants closed and travel restricted, I have lots of free time. I feel like I should be getting so much done.

But I’m not. I’m distracted and fighting to concentrate. I’m in bed a little longer every night, but I’m not sleeping as well. I’m spending more time than ever scrolling through Facebook, Instagram and Medium. It feels like an accomplishment to play Words With Friends.

Turns out, I’m not the only one struggling. “We’re feeling less productive and more fatigued because we are not equipped for this,” says Melanie Ross Mills, a family relationship expert in Dallas.

We’re not in February anymore

Many of us ‘check out’ in response to trauma, and we’re all facing trauma these days. “We can’t accomplish what we could have been able to do last February. Our continuity is lost and we’re feeling highly distracted,” says Mills. “For comfort, we binge — on Netflix, on that extra bag of Doritos, on a glass of rosé — and that contributes to our inability to focus.”

Even those of us who are used to working from home are not used to COVID-19. “We are facing a very real threat, and a physiological response is inevitable,” says Beth Darnall, associate professor and psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine.

In the face of this threat, our nervous systems can shift into high alert. Our heart rates and respiration rates can climb. We might have anxious thoughts. Our cortisol and adrenaline levels can increase. “All of this is physically fatiguing,” Darnall says. “And mentally, it’s difficult to concentrate on work details when you’re reading about people dying.”

The uncertainty these days also adds to our struggles. “People want to feel in control over their lives,” says Ashley Baldwin, a licensed professional counselor in Emmaus, Penn. “We feel powerless over this pandemic. It’s leaving people feeling stressed out, depressed, and anxious.”

Creating a sense of safety and stability can help minimize the negative effects of living through a pandemic. Here are eight things we can try:

1. Maintain a “new normal” routine

Even when we’re staying home, we can shower, dress, eat, sleep, work, and practice self-care on a regular timetable. “In a normal life schedule, we have biorhythms that offer us cues that are grounding and stabilizing,” Darnall says. “As much as possible we want to maintain those natural biorhythms.”

2. Give yourself grace

Many of us expect ourselves to perform at pre-pandemic levels. “Have compassion. Assure yourself that nobody is performing at their peak right now,” Darnall says.

Mills agrees. “It’s really important to give ourselves permission to let go — to accept the fact it’s not like it was in February,” she says. “We can be so hard on ourselves when we’re not who we used to be and not functioning the way we know.”

3. Find a substitute for your commute

Look for a new ritual to help you transition from work time to home time. “Sometimes we just need to decompress on our way home from work, and we aren’t given the time to do that now,” Baldwin says.

4. Limit your news consumption

“If we all take stock of the amount of time we have been spending engaging in the news, it’s probably a fairly low return on investment,” Darnell says. She recommends taking a news vacation for a day or two — did it change how you felt or how you slept, or allow you to focus on things that are under your control?

5. Try techniques that promote peaceful feelings

To calm our nervous systems and ground and center ourselves we can try guided relaxation audio files, diaphragmatic breathing, or meditation. “These can counteract the effects of stress and deregulation,” Darnall says. “We’re essentially training ourselves toward stability.”

6. Acknowledge your increased demands

Even something as simple as picking up groceries for a neighbor adds to our stress these days. And many of us are facing much greater demands, like homeschooling, caring for sick loved ones, and managing a household where everyone is home all the time. The simple act of recognizing these additional responsibilities can make it easier to cope.

7. Do the things you already know you should

All of the tried-and-true self-care strategies are even more important now — eat right, take breaks, exercise and spend time outside (responsibly).

8. Practice gratitude, especially now

“Gratitude for me unlocks everything. It’s paramount,” Mills says. “Ask yourself, ‘In what ways are you seeing life transformed for the better? How are you becoming a better person?’”"

The changes we've seen in the last weeks would've been unthinkable.

The times we're living in now are also likely taking a toll on all of us, says Robin Stern, a psychologist and the associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. ""We're all anxious about the news, stressed and stretched from dealing with the day-to-day disruption.""

It's not just the grave news reports we're getting, says Stern. We can't engage in the usual routines that help us cope, like working out at the gym, meeting up with a friend for coffee or even our morning commute. It's natural that we're going to be more irritable, less patient and less calm, she says. The disruption and uncertainty is affecting nearly every aspect of our lives.

Uncertainty can trigger a fear response — and the stakes are high right now

What we're experiencing as a result of the pandemic is unprecedented in many ways, including the amount of uncertainty we're all facing. Uncertainty is particularly difficult to deal with because it triggers fear, says Neda Gould, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and director of the mindfulness program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We view uncertainty as a potential threat to our well-being.""

Right now, the stakes feel really high, says Gould. We don't know how the virus might physically affect us or our loved ones, how our work and ability to provide for ourselves and our families might be affected or when we'll be able to eat, move and socialize again in the ways we like. ""There's uncertainty on many levels,"" she says.

In general, if the stakes are higher, the threat feels higher, Gould explains. For example, let's say you're waiting to hear whether you're going to be offered a job you really want. The uncertainty around the prospect of not getting the job is a ""threat"" to your potential livelihood and professional happiness. By contrast, if the stakes are lower, the threat feels lower. If, for instance, a friend doesn't immediately respond to your phone call, the ""threat"" of not being able to chat isn't such a big deal.

Gould points out that it's the small routines in our daily lives — walking the dog, riding the train to work, picking up the dry cleaning — that help create a sense of normalcy. And often when there are larger global or societal stressors, it's these daily routines that help us ""escape"" those more ominous concerns and feel comforted. But she warns, ""This is not the case with the coronavirus pandemic — where even our daily activities are significantly impacted.""

It's not just you — none of us do well with this much uncertainty

Whether deciding when to cross a busy street, whether to buy or not buy a house or which college to attend, we all need a reasonable degree of certainty to act, explains Arie Kruglanski, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland. ""When uncertainty strikes, especially concerning many of people's life's domains, people experience angst.""

Kruglanski's work over the past several decades has investigated why some of us react to uncertainty with more intensity than others. Part of the answer, he says, is determined by the individual's need for cognitive closure, which simply put, is ""the need for certainty."" It's also a matter of how important or trivial the uncertainty is.

It's not surprising that right now, the amount of uncertainty we're facing is troublesome to us all, he says. ""Uncertainty that is coupled with mortal danger, such as the current pandemic, is unlikely to be welcomed even by people with a low degree of the need for closure.""

How to better manage when the world has been turned upside down

There are a number of healthy coping strategies you can use to manage stress and anxiety during the pandemic. Here's what the experts say will help.

1. Start with you

Self-care has never been more important, says Stern. When everyone around you is anxious and on edge, the best way to stay healthy and help those in need around you is by taking care of yourself. Get sleep, eat well and engage in some kind of movement every day. Do the things that will help you stay calm and centered. Those steps are the priority right now.

2. Don't judge your anxieties — or those of the people around you

Go easy on yourself and others. This is an unusual situation, so don't beat yourself up for feeling anxious or upset, says Stern. Acknowledge your feelings and think about how to deal with them one step at a time.

Similarly, don't judge others for their anxieties or reactions. People are going to miss out on sports tournaments, graduations, weddings and even funerals, along with countless other celebrations, over the next few months. There are going to be disappointments. Those feelings are real, and they matter — even if other losses are happening that you might view as more serious. It's important for all of us to keep the bigger picture in perspective, but we still need to give ourselves (and those around us) permission to feel the feelings we have, Stern says.

3. Stay connected — virtually

Kruglanski suggests thinking of virtual meetups as both communication and commiseration. Sterns adds that it's times like these when we need one another most. And even though we can't physically be together, it's important to stay connected through social media, phone calls and video conferencing.

4. Try practicing radical acceptance

Get as comfortable as you can with the idea that many things — including those that you can normally control — are no longer within your control, Stern says. Right now, the only constant is change. It's a hard mindset to adopt, she says, but letting go of the things you can't control will help you focus on the things you can. She suggests starting with positive self-talk. Tell yourself that you'll concentrate on the things you can control, such as cooking a meal, calling a friend or starting your day with a workout.

5. Focus on the facts

It's important to stay informed about the new policies being implemented and any updated guidelines you should follow. But keep your focus on the facts without adding the ""what ifs,"" says Gould. He recommends that if you do find yourself in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, practicing deep breathing and mindfulness techniques to dial it back.

6. Avoid information overload

Stay informed, but don't read about the pandemic all day every day. Pick a few trusted sources of information and decide when you're going to tune in and check them. Then stick with that schedule. Constant news consumption, says Stern, is more likely to fuel your anxiety than to be helpful.

7. Have fun

It's a serious situation, but taking time to do the things that make you smile and laugh can make daily life more enjoyable, Stern says. Find the small joys in the situation, like getting to spend more time with loved ones, cooking or watching funny movies. We need those warm, caring moments right now, she says.

8. Be grateful for what you have

Spend some time thinking about the things that make you feel grateful. Then express your gratitude to others. Tell your friends and family how much you appreciate them. When they reciprocate, says Stern, accept their messages of appreciation and gratitude. Sharing these feelings can make us feel cared for — and make us feel good.

9. Take control of the things you can control

Focus on the aspects of your daily routine that you can still follow — or create a new routine that suits your current situation. Kruglanski says this can help you stay on track throughout the day, as well as allow you to continue progressing toward your bigger life goals. Look for opportunities to catch up on the backlog of things you always wished you had more time for, like learning a language, reading novels or reorganizing your closets. Find new routines that make you happy, says Kruglanski. ""Exploit the positive opportunities.""

118,2020-04-16 12:24:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus-12-questions-ask-yourself-sane-while-quarantine-t178678,Coronavirus: 12 questions to ask yourself to stay sane while in quarantine,"If six weeks ago you’d told me that my social calendar was about to free up entirely, that shoes would be a thing of the past and I’d have a dozen more hours a week free, I’d have leapt for joy. I was deeply craving some serious R&R, but living under lockdown during a global pandemic, it turns out, isn’t exactly a staycation. While self-isolating and social distancing may be the best actions we can take as a society to stem the spread of the coronavirus, it's challenging for many of us. As the days blur into weeks, it’s increasingly difficult to feel sane.

“Our bodies and our brains are set up to deal with short-term crises that have clear ends in sight,” says Allison Buskirk-Cohen, associate professor and chair of the psychology department at Delaware Valley University. “Long-term ambiguous stressors — like managing the COVID-19 situation — are much more challenging.”

One trick to help handle this stress — and break down the monotony of these long, long quarantine days and nights — is to routinely check in with yourself.

Good questions to ask yourself while quarantined

Here are 12 questions mental health clinicians recommend asking yourself every day.

1. ‘Have I flossed yet today?’

“This question is a silly way of asking about how you’re engaging in physical self-care,” says Burskirk-Cohen. “Self-care is about building healthy habits that you incorporate as part of your daily life: things like getting enough sleep and proper nutrition are critical building blocks. It’s a form of preventative health and shouldn’t be an emergency action.”

2. ‘What are my priorities today?’

“Long-term planning is anxiety provoking right now, since so much is changing each day,” says Buskirk-Cohen. “It’s really difficult to make any kind of long-term plan when you don’t know what’s going to be safe or feasible. Instead, I recommend concentrating on the present. Lists are helpful to me, so I’ll work on a list each morning, prioritizing the items from top to bottom. Simple things that are important, like eating meals, go on the list. Crossing them out gives a sense of accomplishment. It also helps me maintain my focus on priorities, and make sure they are reflecting my values.”

3. ‘How is my body feeling?’

“Doing a check in with your physical body gives you information about where you are feeling stress,” says Robin F. Goodman, licensed clinical psychologist. “Then you can do something to feel better physically, which will have a ripple effect on your mind and emotions.”

4. ‘What emotions am I feeling?’

“Paying attention to your emotions allows you to then be intentional about managing them,” Goodman says.

5. ‘Am I asking too much of myself?’

“We need to be able to recalibrate our expectations given that we are not operating under normal circumstances,” says Mitchell Hicks, clinical psychologist and core faculty member at Walden University's school of psychology. “We can’t give our all to work when we also need to care for children [all day].”

6. ‘Am I asking too much of others?’

“Just like we need to reconsider the expectations of ourselves, what we expect of others needs rethought,” says Hicks. “If you’re a two-income family with both partners working from home, you’ll need to renegotiate how you both work and manage children to try to reduce frustrations between you.”

7. 'What am I stressed about, and how important is it, really?'

“We can all get tied up in the moment-to-moment issues that pop up and seem to throw us off our game, but is it really that important?” Hicks says. “This can get us to calibrate our response.”

8. ‘What do I know for sure is true?’

“Having a few truths you can hold on to as factual can provide some stability at a time of so much uncertainty,” says Racine Henry, a licensed marriage and family therapist. “They can be large or small, [such as”] ‘I’m alive and well. I have food to eat. I don’t have to commute back and forth to work, etc.’”

9. ‘How will I connect with others in a way that celebrates joy?’

“One of the most difficult aspects of social distancing is that we lose interacting with others in enjoyable ways,” says Buskirk-Cohen. “Set regular ways of connecting with friends and family that are not directly related to COVID-19.”

10. ‘What can I do to help someone right now?’

“Looking at what you can do to contribute to others can improve gratitude and a sense of hopefulness,” says Goodman. “It can be as simple as sending a funny text to a friend, clapping out the window [for healthcare workers].”

11. ‘What new habits do I want to form during this time?’

“As difficult as this time is, it does present an opportunity to do things differently,” says Jonathan D. Horowitz, clinical psychologist and CEO of San Francisco Stress and Anxiety Center. “Are there changes you have wanted to make, in your routine, diet or workday? This may be a good time to implement them.”

12. ‘What do I want to learn from this event?’

‘We can't control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond to it, and the meaning that we make of it,” says Horowitz. “When we ask what we can learn from our difficulties, we see ourselves as empowered and capable, and we open the possibility for positive change.”"

Only 14% of respondents said they were very happy, down 31% from the same period in 2018.

During such painful times, the idea of cultivating personal happiness might seem trivial — selfish, even — but it might just be more important now than ever before.

“All of this negative energy taxes the mind, body and spirit,” says Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of “Joy From Fear: Create The Life Of Your Dreams By Making Fear Your Friend.” “As such, it’s vital to intentionally counteract this toxic, fearful energy with a conscientious investment in creating happiness.”

Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology at Yale University who teaches the class “The Science of Well-Being” (an online version is presently free on Coursera), argues the importance of cultivating happiness for its potential health benefits alone. “There's evidence that positive moods can boost our immune system and can protect us from respiratory viruses, so it's not something to feel guilty about; it's a smart strategy just like washing our hands.”

But how does one actually boost happiness during a global pandemic? It’s certainly not as simple or tactile as washing one’s hands — but there are actions we can take to manifest joy. Here’s what experts recommend:"
120,2020-05-08 21:21:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/hobbies-during-quarantine-how-they-can-help-us-pandemic-t180939,Music is getting me through this pandemic — a hobby can do the same for you,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety and stress to such an extent that some experts are warning of a looming mental health crisis.

While the United Nations and the World Health Organization are making resources available to help with this, experts are also offering important advice. One key piece I’ve taken to heart comes from the Mayo Clinic: “Enjoy hobbies that you can do at home.” After all, “a distraction can get you away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed anxiety and depression,” and doing “something positive to manage anxiety is a healthy coping strategy.”

Mayo isn’t alone in this. Numerous experts are encouraging people to return to the hobbies they may have left behind. For some, it might even help ward off a temptation to turn to alcohol.

But for many of us, these days can be extremely hectic. Perhaps you’ve got children at home, and are working to make sure they get educated online while also trying to do your job. Maybe you’ve got sick family members you’re trying to care for.

I’m remotely managing a team of six, and can easily feel that I always have to be “on.” And because I work in tech, people are relying on us more than ever. My company helps businesses move their phone systems to the cloud, which many are doing in the era of COVID-19. It’s a time filled with pressure.

To take care of my mental health, I’ve set aside time to unplug from work. I’ve used that time to recommit to music. I’ve been writing songs, playing my guitar and even making music videos. It has made my daily life better.

Any artistic pursuit can be therapeutic, which explains why many are used as part of therapy programs. And during this pandemic, music has played an especially important role for millions of people. As the World Economic Forum pointed out, crowds have been singing and playing musical instruments from balconies and joining virtual choirs online. (Jon Bon Jovi even gave a shout out to Chicagoans who sang “Livin’ on a Prayer.”)

If you don’t have a creative outlet, now may be a good time to start one. StoneSpring Hospital in Virginia says, “Now is the time to pick up a new instrument, learn how to paint or try a new cooking technique. If you’re not sure where to start, search YouTube for instructional videos.”

Whether you have an established interest or are just dabbling with a new one, here are three tips I recommend for reaping maximum benefits from it during this pandemic:

1. Schedule it

No matter how hectic things are, try to schedule time for your creative outlet. Then, do all you can to stick to it. It could be an hour a few times a week, or a block of a few hours once a week.

I scheduled my music time based on when I start to feel drained mentally. In general for me, that’s Thursdays. So each week on Thursday, I stop working at about 4pm, then spend the rest of the day doing music production and songwriting.

It’s a powerful way to recharge. I perform much better in my work on Fridays when I do this.

If you can seal yourself off in a room somewhere and be away from other people in your home during this time, that’s ideal.

2. Consider your personality type

While your hobby time is yours alone, in which you don’t have to take care of anyone else, you can share it virtually with people who have the same or similar interest. For example, if you want to make music together with a friend over video chat, you may find that fulfilling.

I’m introverted, specifically what Myers-Briggs calls INTJ. I’m experiencing Zoom burnout (also called Zoom fatigue) already. So for me, during a stressful week, the most therapeutic practice is to get in a zone and jam out alone.

3. Create a goal

I find it helpful to not just write and play music for fun, but to specifically have projects I want to accomplish. I look forward to these, and they help incentivize me to pull through on my scheduled time for music.

So I decided I was going to finally edit the music video a friend and I shot for a song we co-wrote, and I’m working toward an EP, a collection of five songs.

If you have children at home, some of these same steps may be very helpful for them as well. I know that music was important to me when I was growing up.

“It’s especially devastating to think about students who rely on music classes to get them through the school day. Or the students who could easily fall through the cracks without the safe spaces they’ve found in band, choir or orchestra,” an activist for music education wrote in a column republished by the Washington Post.

It’s a difficult time for all of us, and there are no easy answers. But if you commit to a pursuit you love, or discover a new one, you just may find that your week gets less exhausting, less stressful and more fruitful.

121,2020-05-06 18:47:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/anxiety-grief-guilt-other-normal-emotions-during-quarantine-t180769,6 weird things you're probably feeling right now that are perfectly normal,"Guilt mixed with gratitude. Nostalgia tinged with remorse. Dread combined with anticipation. These are just a few of the feelings we might experience in a given day — or hour — while sheltering in place. This wacky mashup of intense emotions may make you concerned for your sanity, but according to mental health experts, this is all par for the course of living through a pandemic.

Here’s a look at some of the seemingly strange — but perfectly normal — feelings therapists have observed in their clients in recent weeks.

1. Wanting quarantine to end, but not really

“Many people privately express to me that they are ‘enjoying’ quarantine,” says Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist. “My introverted clients, in particular, are quite pleased with the slower pace of life. Yet, at the same time, it is also normal to desperately want the shelter-in-place orders to end given that they are government-imposed rather than a personal choice.”

2. Guilt and gratitude at the same time

Alisa Kamis-Brinda, licensed clinical social worker, notices patients feeling profound guilt along with a sense of gratitude.

“They are grateful for all that they have, but like everyone else, have uncomfortable feelings about the changes in their lives or feel fearful about what is happening,” Kamis-Brinda says. “Then they remember that there are people who are really struggling with health, financial issues or basic needs. Their mind tells them that they shouldn’t feel bad because of all that they have. It makes sense. They are human and struggling with the scary things going on and the major changes in their lives. At the same time, they know that they are fortunate for all that they have.”

3. A drop in anxiety when you’re typically really anxious

“One interesting paradox I've noticed among my clients who have pre-existing anxiety is actually a reduction in their anxious symptoms, since they feel that, finally, everyone around them is experiencing what they have felt in ‘normal’ times,” says Rebecca Shaw, licensed clinical social worker.

“During normal times, people who suffer from anxiety often feel out of place. That’s both a symptom of the anxiety itself and a byproduct of living in a society in which the majority of people do not experience clinical anxiety. That byproduct effect can compound the symptoms that are already there, making the experience of anxiety much more intense — but in the society we’re living in these days — with markedly higher numbers of people experiencing severe anxiety for the first time — a percentage of those who already suffered from anxiety before the pandemic no longer have that ‘out of place in society’ feeling. It’s almost as if pre-coronavirus anxiety sufferers are veterans of the condition. It’s definitely important to note that those experiencing a decrease in their anxiety symptoms are in the minority, but the phenomenon is fascinating nonetheless.”

4. Nostalgia for the past — and regret for the road not taken

“This smaller world we find ourselves in might remind us of our childhoods, and we might be drawn to things we haven't thought about in a long time,” says Randy Paterson, a psychologist and author. “Related to this is a flight to security. For example, we might find ourselves drawn to the books we read as children or old television shows. I was in a store the other day and found myself looking over the Lego kits.”

Paterson also observes people feeling “regret for opportunities not taken,” adding: “We lived in a world of thousands of restaurants, parks, activities, friends we could have invited over, vacations we might have taken, changes that we could have made in our lives when we had more security and freedom, and so on. For now, at least, many of these opportunities are limited.”

5. Intense grief without a direct cause

“Many clients have expressed a sense of grief and loss that is not commensurate with their direct experience,” says Natalie Mica, licensed professional counselor. “This is a normal reaction to the multitude of losses the collective is facing during this time. In addition, the loss of routine schedules, hobbies, touch, pleasures, entertainment, etc. can account for this.”

6. Apprehension about returning to ‘normal’

“Some people are realizing that they were pretty unhappy in pre-pandemic times, and are unenthusiastic about the idea of returning to an unsatisfying job, or to commuting,” says Jennie Steinberg, licensed marriage family therapist. “Other people really want to resume their pre-pandemic lives but feel a lot of fear about going back out into the world. A lot of people are feeling very uncertain about what ‘moving forward’ looks like.”

Accept these feelings and don’t judge yourself

What are we to do with all these mixed up feelings? Just let them be. Don’t judge or try to change them.

“Accepting our feelings for what they are, rather than trying to fight them, is crucial, since fighting ourselves leads to exhaustion, anger and self-blame — not to mention, it doesn't really work,” says Shaw.

Celeste Viciere, licensed mental health clinician suggests we might also boost our self-compassion given that none of us “has experienced being in a pandemic” before. “There is no right or wrong way to feel. Take it one day at a time. If today is not a good day, that is OK. Work on resetting tomorrow.”"
122,2020-03-03 18:34:00+00:00,https://www.today.com/health/how-survive-coronavirus-anxiety-8-tips-mental-health-experts-t175092,How to survive coronavirus anxiety: 8 tips from mental health experts,"The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. is creating a new age of anxiety and it’s no surprise.

With airports filled with travelers in masks, stores selling out of disinfectant and public health officials urging Americans to prepare for the bug to disrupt daily life, the national level of worry seems to be off the charts.

Mental health experts emphasized it’s normal, and potentially even helpful, to feel anxious at this time.

“Anxiety, when it’s at the right level, encourages us to take positive action,” Dr. Kelli Harding, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, told TODAY.

“It’s OK to have that moment of panic because, in a way, if you can move beyond that, you can start making adequate precautions.”

The problem comes when people start stewing in their fear.

The anxiety is being driven by collective uncertainty over what will happen, even though evidence so far shows the new virus causes mild symptoms in most cases, said Joshua Klapow, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor of public health at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.

People may experience everything from feeling nervous as they watch the news, to experiencing panic when they’re near somebody who coughs or sneezes, he noted. It doesn’t matter if the person with sniffles is someone affected by allergy season.

NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel called it ""coughobia.""

Coughobia. coughing can be healthy. It’s a clearing of the airways. I have a son who struggles to cough on his own. It’s a major problem. Tdy, got an email from a woman with allergies, says she terrifies people when she sniffles. societal pressures, emerging part of virus story. — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) March 3, 2020

“People are now quick to jump to a worst-case scenario. That creates ongoing distress,” Klapow said. “Anxiety is sticky. We tend to make illogical leaps when we’re nervous.”

Ironically, feeling stressed like this not only feels bad, but increases the risk for becoming ill.

When a person’s biological alarm system is over-activated, it floods the body with cortisol — a stress hormone that suppresses the immune system, said Sherry Benton, a licensed psychologist in Tampa, Florida, and founder of TAO Connect, which provides online mental health therapy.

“What’s dangerous is if your anxiety is really exaggerated,” Benton said. “What’s happening to you emotionally? Are you walking around terrified that this is coming, or are you able to prepare and then get on with your life?”

The best treatment for anxiety is often positive action, Harding noted.

Here are some simple steps you can take right now to feel better:

1. Take a media break

Don’t immerse yourself in news about the coronavirus 24/7. “You have to stop scouring social media and the internet for the latest twists and turns,” Klapow advised. Stay up to date using trusted sources, like the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, then step away.

2. Wash your hands frequently

It’s something that will actually lower your risk of getting sick. Learn how to do it properly: for a full 20 seconds using warm water and soap. “It’s quite incredible how helpful that is,” Harding noted.

3. Practice good self-care

Get plenty of nutrients by eating fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly and get enough sleep. “We know that sleep has a direct impact on the immune system. So you can take all the vitamin C you want, but if you’re sleep deprived, your immune system is compromised,” Klapow noted.

“Although those things seem very benign — they don’t seem as potent as putting on a face mask — they are things all of us can do to stay as healthy and as infection-free as possible.”

4. Take sensible steps to prepare

There's definitely reason to take precaution, so being adequately prepared will provide peace of mind. Ready.gov, the government's website, has concrete tips, like storing a two-week supply of water and food.

5. Go for a walk outside

Time spent in nature is soothing for the mind and body. Sunlight may lower your blood pressure, research has found. “If you can, get a little sunshine during your day. Take a stroll. Take a deep breath,” Harding suggested.

6. Acknowledge your anxiety

It's generally unhelpful to tell a highly-anxious person to just stop feeling anxious, Harding said. Instead — whether it's coronavirus or another panic-provoking situation — it's useful to just acknowledge the anxiety and work through it. ""Name it to tame it"" is a mantra in mental health for big emotions, she noted.

7. Write down your worries

Seeing the words on paper or on a screen may stop you from spinning yourself into a frenzy.

“What are you catastrophizing? Write down the things you find yourself thinking and reflect on them. Challenge your own thinking to get it more in balance and reasonable,” Benton said.

8. Send a little love to people who you care about

Put together a text message chain or email chain with family on it — that way you can have it set up before it feels like an emergency situation and easily communicate with your loved ones. “We’re definitely not in this alone,” Harding said."

Harissa, a North African chili paste often made up of tomatoes, dried chiles, olive oil, garlic and various spices such as cumin coriander and caraway seeds, packs this recipe with a major flavor punch. Your friends and family will be begging you to make it. Make sure to toast some crusty bread to sop up all that savory sauce. The second best part about it: easy cleanup!

Unlike larger varieties, cherry tomatoes are available ripe and ready year round. And despite their small size, they’re packed with bright, tomato flavor and just enough sweetness. They’re also wonderfully juicy and pop in your mouth, thanks to their delicate skin.

Though often enjoyed raw in salads or on veggie platters, cherry tomatoes are as versatile as their big brothers and can be used in pasta, pizza, sauces and more. For kitchen inspiration, we asked some of our favorite food pros, including Giada De Laurentiis, Katie Workman, Kelly Senyei, Jennifer Marie Garza, Abra Berens, Martha Stewart, Serena Wolf and Kirsten Buck for their best recipes and tips. If you don’t already have cherry tomatoes in your fridge, you’ll want to add a pint — or maybe two — to your grocery list.

Pesto pizza toast Elizabeth Newman

Caramelized cherry tomatoes are the “star” of this easy dish, says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis. They add “an irresistible pop of sweetness” and great color if you use a mix of red and yellow. “Cherry tomatoes are one of the only kinds of tomatoes I'll use all year round,” adds De Laurentiis. They make “this pesto pizza a go-to for an easy weeknight dinner, no matter what month we are in.”

Spaghetti with Cherry Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella and Basil Serena Wolf

“Cherry tomatoes have such a delightful sweetness, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet Dinnertime:125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners"". Wolf’s simple pasta sauce “highlights their bright, fresh flavor with just a little olive oil, slivered garlic and crushed red pepper for heat.” She cuts some of the tomatoes and leaves the rest whole, for a more interesting texture. “The halved tomatoes break down almost completely, while the larger ones simply soften and add an extra pop of chew and flavor when you bite into them,” Wolf explains.

BELT Salad With Dairy-Free Dilly Ranch Dressing Kristen Buck

Kristen Buck, author of ""Buck Naked Kitchen: Radiant and Nourishing Recipes to Fuel Your Health Journey,"" calls this salad a “lightened up, veggie forward” take on a classic BLT sandwich. Hardboiled eggs add protein and make the salad more substantial, while the Dilly Ranch Dressing is “a step up from standard mayo.” Cherry tomatoes are the most important ingredient, insists Buck, because they add “freshness, acidity and sweetness.” Her favorites are fresh, local and from the farmers’ market in summer, but with sweet, tender cherry tomatoes available year round, you can enjoy this salad whenever you like.

Baked Chicken Caprese Low Carb Inspirations

This easy-to-make, Caprese salad–inspired chicken dish comes from Jennifer Marie Garza, the author of ""Keto Friendly Recipes: Easy Keto for Busy People"" and the blogger behind Low Carb Inspirations. “Cherry tomatoes carry a powerful punch of concentrated tomato flavor” and pair perfectly with chicken, Italian seasonings and mozzarella, explains Garza. “I wouldn’t make this recipe without them!”

Salmon with Polenta and Warm Tomato Vinaigrette Cheyenne Cohen

A warm tomato vinaigrette makes “a great counterpoint” to rich, pan-roasted salmon in this easy yet elegant dish from Katie Workman, the blogger behind The Mom 100 and author of ""Dinner Solved: 100 Ingenious Recipes that Make the Whole Family Happy, Including You"". Just a few minutes on the stove “slightly collapses the cherry tomatoes, and their juices lend a really nice sweet acidity to a simple vinaigrette” made with shallot, oregano, oil and vinegar. Once you make this easy sauce, you’ll want to put it on everything, including chicken, pork or beef. “Definitely think of it when you are grilling this summer,” says Workman.

Tomato Panzanella with Corn, Cucumbers, and Herb Salad EE Berger

Panzanella, at its most fundamental, is a bread salad,” explains Abra Berens, author of ""Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables"". She also describes it as a “one of those magical dishes that becomes more than the sum of its parts.” All kinds of tomatoes are used in panzanella, but Berens likes using cherry tomatoes in this version, because their shape contrasts with the torn bread and small kernels of corn. “Plus, they don’t juice as much as large globe tomatoes, so you can control the texture of the salad longer.” And, perhaps best of all, the combination of cherry tomatoes and frozen corn makes this a year-round dish.

Cherry Tomato Crisp Martha Stewart

“This warm, comforting side dish is the perfect unexpected complement to any main,” says cooking and entertaining expert Martha Stewart. To create this savory spin on the dessert crisp we all know and love, Stewart swaps fruit for cherry tomatoes and turns breadcrumbs, grated cheese and fresh parsley into an irresistible crunchy topping. “I love the combination of the bursting cherry tomatoes with the crispy bread and Parmesan,” says Stewart.

Quick Shrimp Scampi Kelly Senyei

“Shrimp scampi may seem like a fancy, restaurant-only dish,” but it’s surprisingly simple to make at home,” insists Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei. “You really only need a few ingredients to develop a big punch of flavor.” Cherry tomatoes work perfectly in this pasta, because they “soak up all that garlicky, lemony white wine sauce.” Best of all, “aside from cooking the pasta, this entire dish comes together in one pan, making cooking and cleanup a total breeze.”

And yet it’s busy this time of year, so it’s tempting to turn to takeout or delivery to streamline the dinner routine.

Forget the expense of takeout and the charge for delivery. You can serve up your own Korean favorites for less, and prepare them just the way you like. Here’s how.

Bibimbap Courtesy of Korean Bapsang

Bibimbap is simply rice topped with vegetables, meat and sauce. Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients in this recipe. Hyosun Ro, who blogs at Korean Bapsang: A Korean mom’s home cooking, includes a collection of toppings you could choose, but just three of four of them would make a decent bibimbap.

“Bibimbap is much easier to make at home than you might think. You can use leftover side dishes from previous meals, or quickly cut up and blanch or sauté whatever vegetables you have in the fridge or find in your local grocery store,” Ro says.

Just about any vegetables will do — mushrooms, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, spinach, bean sprouts or broccoli slaw, for example. “You only need three or four of these vegetables and your choice of protein such as beef, pork, chicken or even seafood,” she says.

Kimchi Stew Courtesy of My Korean Kitchen

Sue Pressey, creator of My Korean Kitchen, says kimchi jjigae is a staple Korean dish. “Many Korean home cooks make it at home often because it’s very easy and quick to make using readily available ingredients,” she says. “Also, by making it at home, you can easily adjust the spice level of the stew.”

While you can swap the meat based on what you have on hand or your dietary needs, Pressey is a fan of this kimchi jjigae made with pork belly. She says, “When the fat melts into the stew, it adds depth of flavor, making the stew extra hearty and comforting. Just perfect for wintery weather!”

Beef Bulgogi Photo credit: Chungah Rhee

Ready to try making your own Korean barbecue? Chungah Rhee, CEO and founder of Damn Delicious: Quick and Easy Meals for the Home Cook, says it’s easy and shares her take on the recipe for beef bulgogi her mom used to make.

“This is one of my favorite Korean dishes to make at home,” she says. “The secret is freezing the steak for 30 minutes to help slice it real thin.” Those thin slices soak up the marinade and cook quickly, so outside of the marinating this dish comes together in no time.

Serve it with rice and kimchi, or in red leaf lettuce tacos. “It’s a perfect weeknight meal,” Rhee says.

Dupbap Courtesy of Crazy Korean Cooking / Courtesy of Crazy Korean Cooking

It’s getting easier to find sushi-grade fish these days — you might see it in Asian markets, grocery stores that carry prepared sushi, frozen-food cases or online. If a fish isn’t marked as sushi grade, ask — don’t assume it’s OK to eat raw.

Finding sushi-grade fish means making sashimi dishes like dup bap at home can be accessible and affordable. This recipe calls for tuna, salmon and red snapper, but you can mix and match your favorite sushi-grade seafood.

Grace Park, co-founder of Crazy Korean Cooking, recommends preparing this dish for a group, since buying different types of sushi-grade fish is expensive, though not nearly as costly as a restaurant meal.

As with the bibimbap, don’t be intimidated by the long list of ingredients. You can build it with whatever you like. Just the fish, lettuce and sauce would come together nicely. “You can add vegetables and green leaf lettuce, perilla leaves, radish and chili peppers for the best flavor and authenticity,” Park says. “And for picky eaters, you can also just use whatever fish you like.”

Kimbap Courtesy of kimchimari.com

At a glance, you might mistake these Korean seaweed rice rolls for sushi. While they look similar, kimbap typically includes ground beef or prepared meat like Spam instead of raw fish. But like sushi, the rolls come in many different flavors depending on how you fill them.

Korean food blogger JinJoo Lee of Kimchimari: Authentic Korean Recipes Even You Can Cook, shares three different versions of kimbap — the classic beef and vegetables, a variation with burdock roots and cucumbers, and a quick version that uses ham or Spam.

“Even if it’s your very first time making it, you are sure to succeed without too much difficulty and be able to make your kimbap just the way you want it,” Lee says.

Mandu Courtesy of Rasa Malaysia

Bee Yinn Low, the food blogger behind Rasa Malaysia, says that dumplings are traditionally served as part of the Lunar New Year celebration. These are so delicious, though, you’ll want to enjoy them all year round. And while wrapping the dumplings can take a bit of time, you can make 20 to 30 dumplings with her mandu recipe and freeze what you don’t eat, so you’ll have a quick snack or meal ready the next time you’re craving them.

The dumplings get a unique Korean flavor and texture from the kimchi in the filling. “The recipe is so easy and versatile,” Low says. “You can customize the ingredients in the filling and choose the preferred protein — pork, beef, chicken, turkey or vegetarian. It’s also very affordable because you can make dozens of the dumplings with the recipe.”

Get on it. Or add toppings just as they do down at the pie shop in town: cooked crumbled sausage or ground beef; pitted black olives; sauteed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; pepperoni; anchovies; whatever you like.

Ingredients

1 round pizza dough (recipe follows)

3 tablespoons pizza sauce (recipe follows)

Extra-virgin olive oil

2 3/4 ounces fresh mozzarella

4 to 5 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn

Directions

Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn the heat to its highest setting. Let the oven heat for at least an hour. Stretch the dough and use a spoon to apply the sauce to its center. Use the back of the spoon to spread the sauce evenly across the surface, stopping about 1/₂ inch from the edges. Drizzle a little oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Add other toppings, if using any, to taste. Scatter the basil leaves over the top. Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 4 to 8 minutes.

THE BEST PIZZA DOUGH

Ingredients

306 grams “00” flour (about 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons)

306 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons), plus more for dusting

16 grams kosher salt (about 2 teaspoons)

4 grams active dry yeast (about 1 ¹/₂ teaspoons)

8 grams extra-virgin olive oil (about 2 teaspoons)

Directions

In a large mixing bowl, combine the “00” flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. In a small mixing bowl, stir together 400 grams (a little less than 2 cups) lukewarm tap water, the yeast, and the oil, then pour it into the flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, about 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes. Knead the rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 4 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with a dampened cloth, and allow to rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.) To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.

HOW TO STRETCH PIZZA DOUGH

Working on a floured surface, with floured hands, softly pat down the risen ball of dough into a circle, rotating it as you do. Using the tips of your fingers, push down gently around the perimeter of the pie, rotating it as you do, to create the edge. Pick up the dough and lightly pass it back and forth between your palms, trying to rotate it each time you do, using gravity to help the dough stretch. At about 12 inches in diameter, the pizza is ready to go. Return the pizza to the floured surface, making sure that the side that you first pressed down on remains facing upward, and gently slide the pie back and forth a few times to make sure that it does not stick. Add a little more flour to the surface beneath the pie if it does. Gently slide a lightly floured pizza peel beneath the pie, or place it carefully on a floured cutting board or the back of a baking pan. Make sure again that the dough can slide back and forth. If it does, the pie is certified for topping.

A SIMPLE PIZZA SAUCE

Empty a 28-ounce can of good tomatoes into a food processor or blender. Add a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Whiz that together and use about 3 tablespoons per pie. Leftover sauce can be kept, covered, in the refrigerator and used for more pizzas later, or as a simple pasta sauce.

Plus, making pancakes is really easy. Try this basic foolproof recipe and feel free to jazz it up with flavorful add-ins like fruit, cinnamon or chocolate.

Kelly Senyei

Prepare the batter by whisking together 1½ cups of all-purpose flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, whisk together 1¼ cups whole milk with 1 large egg and 2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until combined.

Kelly Senyei

Avoid over-mixing the batter to ensure your pancakes are light and fluffy rather than dense and flat. The batter should still be lumpy after you mix it.

Kelly Senyei

Heat a skillet or griddle pan over medium-low heat then grease it with vegetable oil, butter or a combination of the two. Drop 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter into the pan, spacing the pancakes at least 2 inches apart. At this point, you can sprinkle assorted mix-ins on top, such as chocolate chips, fruit or nuts. Once bubbles form on the tops of the pancakes, flip them once and continue cooking until they are no longer doughy.

Using a spatula, transfer the pancakes to a plate and serve immediately with your choice of toppings.

Sure, but why stop there? In terms of nutrition, eggs pack a punch and are a source of protein, iron, vitamins and minerals. They’re also inexpensive and easy to cook, plus eggs can be prepared in myriad ways from baked to poached to fried to scrambled and are wildly versatile, working with a wide range of ingredients and in a variety of different cuisines. There’s also the fact that eggs are the kind of staple ingredient we always pick up at the market and always keep in the fridge.

All that is to say, there’s no need to limit eggs to topping your favorite dishes and there’s certainly no need to reserve them for breakfast and brunch. To help you make and enjoy egg’s full potential, we’ve rounded up recipes and tips from chefs and food pros, including Andrew Zimmern, Giada De Laurentiis, Teri Turner, Kevin Curry and Stacy Adimando. They’ve shared their favorites, which range from Middle Eastern-inspired baked eggs to a quick and irresistible pasta to egg-filled potato skins. If you don’t have eggs in your fridge already, you better go pick up a dozen — or maybe two!

If there’s anything better than potato skins, it’s definitely these scrambled egg–filled and bacon-topped potato skins, created by Teri Turner, author of ""No Crumbs Left: Recipes for Everyday Food Made Marvelous"". Potato skins, says Turner, are “a spectacular carrier for just about anything.” Scramble some eggs, add bacon and chives, and you have a hearty breakfast or light dinner that’s “crunchy on the outside, buttery on the inside, with a luscious bite of egg,” says Turner. “It’s absolutely delicious.”

Sweet Onion Carbonara Courtesy of Giadzy

When it comes to turning eggs into dinner, TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis looks to pasta and specifically, carbonara, a Roman classic that uses eggs, cream and cheese to create an irresistibly luscious sauce. “I am a big fan of reinventing classics and this carbonara is no exception,” she explains. “I love the sweetness the dish gets from the caramelized onions.” To keep that creamy sauce creamy, cook it over low heat and only briefly. “The eggs add a wonderful velvety texture from just warming them through and cooking gently,” says De Laurentiis. “You wouldn’t want to end up with pasta a la scrambled eggs!”

Linguine and Prosciutto Frittatas Courtesy of Giadzy

These pasta-filled frittatas are a spin on pizza di spaghetti, a dish De Laurentiis grew up eating and that was often made with leftover pasta from the night before. Frittatas are flexible and can be filled with almost anything. In addition to linguine, De Laurentiis packs hers with prosciutto, garlic and fresh parsley, plus Asiago, mozzarella and mascarpone. “These mini versions are perfect for a weekend brunch or even a weeknight dinner alongside a salad,” says De Laurentiis, who also likes to pack them in her daughter’s lunchbox.

Salad with Poached Eggs and Bacon Vinaigrette Photo credit: Madeleine Hill

“You taste the purity of eggs when you poach them,” says Andrew Zimmern, the James Beard Award–winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""Bizarre Foods"". While he uses poached eggs for all kinds of dishes, including eggs benedict and on top of burgers and waffles, Zimmern “adores the flavor of eggs paired with greens, vinaigrette and of course, bacon,” as in this elegant salad he created. For perfect poached eggs, Zimmern says “timing is everything,” as you don’t want to overcook them. Another trick is to “use acidulated water to keep the whites gathered.”

Chilaquiles Photo credit: Madeleine Hill

Zimmern also adds eggs to chilaquiles, a Mexican dish featuring fried corn tortillas that are cooked in salsa and sprinkled with cheese. “Paired with fried eggs, they are one of my favorite breakfasts,” says Zimmern, who recommends using a super-hot pan to fry eggs. “Let the edges get lacy and crispy before serving,” he says.

Tex-Mex Shakshuka Courtesy of FitMenCook

Inspired by a trip to Israel, this is fitness influencer and ""Fit Men Cook"" author Kevin Curry’s take on shakshuka, a Mediterranean dish in which eggs are poached in a tomato-based sauce flavored with different herbs and spices. Because shakshuka is another highly adaptable egg dish, Curry puts a Tex-Mex spin on his version. “Life’s all about finding ways to mix things up!” says Curry. “Crossing recipes and flavor profiles that would never normally share a plate is a great way to add variety.” With that in mind, Curry incorporates onion, green bell pepper and spicy chili powder, along with more traditional spices like cumin and coriander.

Broccolini Frittata Photo credit: Linda Pugliese

“Forgiving” and “endlessly adaptable” is how Stacy Adimando, author of ""Piatti: Plates and Platters for Sharing, Inspired by Italy"" describes frittatas. Adimando’s features broccolini and is topped with chopped anchovies, grated cheese, or both, depending on your preferences, but you can use “almost any cooked vegetable, cheese or herb,” she insists. Plus, frittatas can be served hot, at room temperature or even chilled. Finishing a frittata in the oven is a little easier, but Adimando insists flipping one on the stovetop isn’t as hard as it seems. “Have confidence and be sure to wiggle the first side of the frittata loose in the pan before transferring it to a plate and flipping.” Also, use a nonstick skillet or at least a very well-seasoned one.

Here are 6 twists on chicken soup you'll love","January is maybe the ""soupiest"" month in the calendar year. It’s cold, the over-the-topness of the holidays has come to a close, and we’re all trying to reign it in a bit. Soup is also comforting, easy to make, versatile, perfect for incorporating leftovers, and just downright delicious. And if the soup community (what, it’s not a thing?) could elect their leader, it would almost definitely be chicken soup. Which has the reputation for also being “medicinal” as well as soothing and savory — if you want to challenge that contention, go ahead. I’ll argue back while slurping on some chicken noodle soup.

And guess what? Pretty much every part of the world has a version of chicken soup! While many of us do think of the classic American/Jewish chicken noodle soup, or maybe even chicken matzoh ball soup, or the perfect storm of chicken noodle matzoh ball soup (food of the gods) as the quintessential chicken soup, there’s lots more chicken soups to sample.

And how simple and pleasurable to explore other cuisines by experimenting with different flavors in the guise of one of the most welcoming soup categories out there. Whether you’re fighting the cold, or fighting an actual cold, a bowl of chicken soup is just the thing.

Red Lentil, Fennel and Chicken Slow Cooker Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

This Indian-ish inspired soup is completely satisfying, thick, fragrant with cumin and coriander, and slightly dal-like in personality because of the red lentils. Fennel is like celery that’s done some push-ups, with an anise-ish flavor that elevates everything else. And the fresh parsley at the end kind of makes the soup, for me. Plus, a slow-cooker soup — always a yes.

Thai Chicken Noodle Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

Comfort food, but on the lighter side. If you’ve never cooked with rice noodles, let’s take a quick pause. There is nothing hard about cooking them, in the same way that there is nothing hard about cooking any kind of noodles or pasta. The difference is with rice noodles, you are usually giving them a soak in very hot water, versus adding them to a pot of boiling water. The coconut milk adds nuttiness and creamy-ness, the fish sauce adds umami (which roughly translates to the word savory-ness) and both are easy to find in the Asian section of the supermarket, or online. A bit of lime juice, ginger, and jalapeño elevate the flavor and will also help clear out any congestion!

The Easiest Shortcut Chicken Ramen Noodle Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

It’s not the complicated recipe creation that makes me feel happy and proud so much ... it’s the easy ones. You simply simmer the bones and skin of a rotisserie chicken (everything but the meat, which you shred and save for the soup itself) in some broth, all on their own, or with the addition of a few chunks of carrot, celery and onion if you feel like taking one extra step. Then you strain the broth and add cooked ramen noodles (you’ll toss those little salty packets of “flavoring”). Add some sliced carrots and celery to the strained broth for color and flavor and texture and a nod to the fact that it’s nice to have produce in your chicken noodle soup. The dill is optional though it does make chicken noodle soup taste like chicken noodle soup to folks who grew up with the Jewish version of this soup.

Avgolemono Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

Avgolemono is the lemony chicken soup of Greece. It has a richness and a thickness that comes from whisking in some eggs into part of the liquid, then whisking that mixture back into the whole pot. It’s sometimes made with rice, but often made with orzo (a rice-shaped noodle), which I used here. Our family likes a lot of bang for their buck in their chicken soup, so this one is fairly well populated with chicken, orzo and fresh herbs.

Fragrant Chicken Tomato Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

The word “fragrant” is in the title because when the coriander and the cumin join the chicken and the onions in the hot pan, the smell will make everyone within 250 feet feel instantly ravenous. This soup is chunky and the tomatoes add a lovely richness and acidity.

Mexican Tortilla Chicken Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

This divine soup is scented with chili, cumin and coriander, and topped with all kinds of deliciousness, like avocado and tortilla crisps. This is one of my favorite soups of all time.

Of course, it’s easy to hit up your favorite food delivery app, where you’ll no doubt find a wide assortment of noodle dishes. However, an even better option is to ditch the takeout and make your own noodles.

Homemade noodle dishes are not just easier and faster than you think; they’re also far better for you. When you choose the ingredients and do the cooking, you know just what’s going in your bowl — and belly — and can control not only the quality and nutrition, but also the flavor. You’ll likely want to follow a recipe, but if you love red peppers yet loathe green ones, you can customize the ingredient list to suit your palette.

Here, food pros, including Giada De Laurentiis, Serena Wolf, Kelly Senyei, Kevin Curry and Alexandra Stafford, share their best noodles dishes, plus cooking tips and ingredient swaps. With these recipes and tips, all that’s left is to stock the pantry and boil some water!

By making japchae at home, you can control the amount of oil and sugar in the dish. Elizabeth Newman for Giadzy

""Making your own japchae at home is really quite easy and quick to do,” insists TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis. This Korean stir-fry is traditionally made with potato starch vermicelli noodles, but you can substitute angel hair pasta. “You also get to control the amount of oil and sugar in the dish,” says De Laurentiis. “In my version, I swap in honey for refined sugar and pack it with tons of healthy and colorful veggies for a bowl of noodles everyone will enjoy.”

This healthier pad Thai recipe doubles down on the cabbage and pulls back on the noodles. Kevin Curry/Fit Men Cook

“A flavor journey,” is how fitness influencer and ""Fit Men Cook"" author Kevin Curry describes his Chicken Pad Thai. “It’s a robust medley,” featuring crunchy cabbage, chewy chicken and a vibrant and complex sauce, plus hearty brown rice noodles. To make his version of this takeout classic a bit lighter and leaner, Curry doubles down on the cabbage and pulls back on the noodles. “I like to prioritize vegetables, because they’re “filling and help cut calories,” notes Curry. And if chicken’s not your thing, swap in shrimp, tofu or flank steak.

In addition to being gluten free, butternut squash noodles add an extra serving of vegetables to your day. Kevin Curry/Fit Men Cook

Love spaghetti and meat sauce but not the weighed down feeling you get after devouring a big bowl? We feel you and so does Curry, who created this better-for-you version made with butternut squash noodles and ground lamb. In addition to being gluten free, butternut squash noodles add an extra serving of vegetables to your day. Ground lamb is a fattier meat, which means you need very little oil to cook it in. Alternatively, you can sub lean ground beef or turkey. If you’re short on time — or don’t have a spiralizer — Curry says it’s fine to use pre-spiralized veggies from the supermarket and says he sometimes does so, too — just make sure they’re as fresh possible.

This recipe uses that package of ramen noodles in the back of your pantry -- along with almost any vegetable you have on hand. Alexandra Stafford

“I love so many things about this recipe,” says ""Bread Toast Crumbs"" author and Alexandra’s Kitchen blogger Alexandra Stafford. “It’s fast, it’s loaded with vegetables and the dressing is made with pantry staples, so when time is at a premium, I can throw these noodles together.” And then there’s the taste. The sauce has a “salty-sweet dynamic” and “a nice amount of heat thanks to crushed red pepper flakes,” says Stafford. Best of all, this dish can be made with so many different vegetables, from cabbage, Swiss chard, kale and bok choy to carrots, bell peppers and snap peas. “The key is to cut the vegetables thinly, so they cook quickly,” notes Stafford.

These drunken noodles can be customized with any kind of protein, vegetable or protein. Kelly Senyei

“Making takeout-inspired dishes from scratch guarantees you know every single ingredient that goes into it,” says Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei. “Best of all, you can customize with different proteins or varying degrees of spice to suit your palate.” This Thai favorite is traditionally made with wide rice noodles, and though it might not be authentic, “any noodle will work, including Italian varieties, such as pappardelle and tagliatelle,” says Senyei. “The thicker the noodle, the more surface area to soak up all that garlicky sauce.” And when it comes to stir-frying, Senyei’s top tip is to have all your ingredients fully prepped before you start cooking. “Stir-frying is a very fast cooking technique, and you don't want to have to stop mid-process to find the garlic or dice the peppers.”

This Thai-inspired curry is made with good-for-you ingredients, including veggies, lean protein and coconut milk. Serena Wolf

“This dish comes together in less time than it takes to get takeout or delivery — 25 minutes max,” says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners"". It’s also “loaded with bright, fresh flavor, tender shrimp and plenty of delicate rice noodles.” Despite its decadent flavor, this Thai-inspired curry “is made with good-for-you ingredients, including veggies, lean protein and coconut milk.” And like most noodle dishes, it’s ripe for improvisation. Halibut, cod, salmon or chicken make great swaps for the shrimp. Or, go vegan with tofu or chickpeas.

This plant-based dish is packed with filling fiber and protein and comes together in about 30 minutes. Serena Wolf

Roasted cauliflower turns “beautifully caramelized and buttery in the oven and pairs amazingly well with the slight nuttiness of buckwheat soba noodles,” says Wolf of this unexpected veggie and noodle combo. Her ginger-scallion dressing is simple but lends “awesome umami flavor with just the right amount of heat,” while “a squeeze of fresh lime juice just before serving brightens things up.” This is also a plant-based dish, packed with filling fiber and protein and comes together in about 30 minutes. Be sure to save any leftovers — these noodles are just as good served cold or at room temperature, notes Wolf.

The skin is fried into a lacquered mahogany. The meat beneath it tastes of five-spice, ginger and soy and is generally accompanied by the hum of oyster sauce mixed with the zing of the pickled Scotch bonnet pepper sauce that is seemingly omnipresent on the island's tables. Do not stint on the lime used in the marinade. It offers a tartness that helps cut the saltiness of the soy.

TRINI-CHINESE CHICKEN

Ingredients

8 to 10 chicken thighs, legs, and wings (about 3 pounds total)

2 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder

3 or 4 limes

3 tablespoons soy sauce

One 2-inch knob fresh ginger, peeled and minced

¹/₂ cup neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed

2 tablespoons sesame oil

¹/₂ cup oyster sauce

1 to 3 tablespoons Scotch bonnet pepper sauce, such as Matouk’s

Freshly ground black pepper

¹/₄ cup chopped green scallions

Directions

In a large nonreactive bowl, toss the chicken with the five-spice powder, then with the juice of 2 of the limes, the soy sauce, and ginger. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to a full day. Combine the oils in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. There should be at least 1/4 inch of oil in the pan. When the oil is hot, remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing the excess marinade to drip back into the bowl, and fry, in batches if necessary to not crowd the pan, turning the pieces frequently, until well browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce. Combine the oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of the hot pepper sauce, and the juice of the third lime and stir to combine. Adjust the seasonings with more hot sauce, lime juice, and black pepper to taste. Garnish with the scallions and serve with white or fried rice, with a drizzle of the sauce over each piece of chicken and the remaining sauce on the side.

Choosing animal products that are sustainable and humanely raised is one consideration we all need to focus in on. And eating less meat is another: smaller portions, more vegetarian moments in the week ... all of this can contribute to the health of our families as well as our planet and neighbors.

But, hey, no soapboxes here — just an awareness that even small changes add up on all sorts of fronts. One way to move the needle is to institute one completely vegetarian meal per week in your home, a Meatless Monday (or any day that works for you). And it doesn’t have to be on one consistent day — the point is simply to consciously make one dinner completely meat free. Whether you decide to go full vegan (no dairy, eggs, honey or anything that comes from an animal) is of course up to you.

So, yes, we know there are a lot of reasons to think more vegetarian thoughts, but if it’s not delicious and satisfying — and if you can’t sell it to your family — then all of the good intentions in the world will fizzle out pretty quickly. So, without further ado, our first collection of crowd-pleasing meatless recipes for March, one for each week in the month!

Mediterranean Lentil, Red Onion and Avocado Salad Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

If you ever thought lentil salads were boring, think again! Fresh, delicious, and so easy to make. In this salad lentils (try and get the French ones) are simply cooked, then combined with a balsamic dressing and some lightly cooked vegetables. And then the finishing touches: diced avocado, plus healthy handfuls of sliced scallions and herby fresh parsley. The colorful assortment of chopped and diced vegetables results in a lentil salad that’s a little lighter than straight lentil salads, and very varied (e.g., not at all boring) within each bite.

Instant Pot Vegetable Chili Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

The classic perfect vegetarian chili recipe, reinterpreted for the Instant Pot. It’s straightforward, it’s delicious, it’s economical, it’s just what a vegetarian chili should be. If you don’t have an Instant Pot, you can cook it in a regular slow cooker, but you will have to sauté some of the ingredients first. And you also can make it on the stove, and just let it simmer for an hour or so once all of the ingredients are in the pot. Skip the sour cream and shredded cheese at the end, or use dairy-free versions, if you are looking to keep the meal vegan.

Farrotto with Golden Beets, Mixed Herbs and Crispy Shallots Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

Farrotto is essentially risotto, but instead of being made with short grain rice (like arborio) it’s made with farro. Farro is an ancient hearty wheat grain, with a chewy texture, and it’s a good source of iron, fiber and protein. Its nutritional value makes it an excellent grain to incorporate into all kinds of dishes, particularly for vegetarians. This is another true one-pot meal.

Creamy Four Cheese Pasta Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

And now for something a little decadent — reach for this gem on a day that calls for a splurge. Skipping meat is hardly a hardship when there is a vat of creamy mac and cheese taking center stage. This one is ultra velvety and lush thanks to a blend of mascarpone (Italian-style cream cheese), cheddar, Monterey Jack, and creamy goat cheese. This is kind of the Rolls Royce of mac and cheeses. Balance out all that cheese and dairy with these roasted winter vegetables with Sriracha honey glaze.

The gravy stretches nicely over buttered noodles, so three pounds of meat goes a long way. You could tip it into a baking dish and top with puff pastry or mashed potatoes if you're bound for a potluck; you could definitely make a batch and put it in the freezer against the knowledge that some day you're going to need it to feed a crowd on the quick. It delivers big, big flavor whenever it's served. Served with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes — something starchy and rich.

Ingredients

4 tablespoons (¹/₂ stick) unsalted butter

2 large red onions, peeled and diced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

2 carrots, peeled and chopped

2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped

10 button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced

3 pounds brisket (preferably second cut) or stew meat, chopped into bite-size pieces

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 fresh rosemary sprig

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Two, 12-ounce cans stout

8 ounces grated cheddar cheese

Preparation

Heat the oven to 375°F. In a large, oven-safe pan fitted with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat. When the butter melts and begins to foam, add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are dark in color and the moisture released by them has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Season the beef pieces all over with salt and pepper. Add the beef and rosemary to the pan, then sprinkle the flour over them and cook over high heat, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add enough Guinness just to cover the beef. Cover the pan and put it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and stir. Return to the oven and cook for 1 hour more. If the sauce remains thin, set the pot over medium-low heat, remove the lid, and reduce the liquid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold in the cheese and stir to combine.

Now we’re ready to introduce some of our favorite meals back into rotation, without going off the deep-end and undoing a month of hard work.

For those nights when we decide to loosen the reigns a bit, lightened-up comfort food recipes that will satisfy cravings are key. Case in point: this baked broccoli mac and cheese from registered dietitian Alix Turoff's latest book, ""Lose Your Belly Fat Cookbook: A Jumpstart Plan and 75 Delicious Recipes for Weight Loss"". The recipe gets a healthy twist with high-protein chickpea pasta, skim milk and reduced-fat cheese, and even manages to sneak some veggies in. Perhaps the best news, you can have it on the table in 35 minutes flat, which is my kind of weeknight dinner.

Another upside? You’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t like mac and cheese. From your picky toddler, to your spouse, to your best friend — the gooey, carby dish gets two thumbs up regardless who you’re sharing the dinner table with.

Baked Broccoli Mac and Cheese

Servings: 6

Total cook time: 35 minutes

Ingredients

12 ounces chickpea pasta (dry)

1 ½ tbsp butter

¼ cup yellow onion (minced)

¼ cup flour

2 cups skim milk (or milk of choice)

1 cup chicken broth (or vegetable broth)

8 ounces reduced fat cheddar cheese (~2 cups shredded)

¼ tsp sea salt and black pepper (to taste)

12 ounces broccoli florets (pre-cut)

2 tbsps Parmigiano Reggiano

¼ cup bread crumbs (seasoned)

Nonstick cooking spray

Preparation

Cook pasta and broccoli together in a large pot of salted water, according to package directions for al dente (or slightly under cook 2-3 minutes). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large skillet, melt butter. Add onion and cook over low heat about 2 minutes, add flour and cook another minute, or until the flour is golden and well combined. Add milk and chicken broth and whisk, raising heat to medium-high until it comes to a boil; cook ~5 minutes or until the sauce becomes smooth and thick. Season with salt and pepper. Once the sauce is thick, remove from heat, add cheese and mix well until cheese is melted. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, add cooked macaroni and broccoli and mix well. Pour into prepared baking dish. Top with grated cheese and breadcrumbs. Spray a little more cooking spray on top. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then broil for a few minutes to get the breadcrumbs golden.

135,2020-02-28 22:30:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/taqueria-style-fish-tacos-salsa-lime-crema-ncna1145116,Taqueria-style fish tacos with salsa and lime crema,"The mother recipe is simple: Cook fish, serve in a taco. You can grill the fish. You can fry it. Whatever method you use can yield fish worth folding into a tortilla. Here, though, is a bespoke fish taco recipe I ginned up after watching a bunch of chefs cook fish fillets for a lot longer on one side than another, seeing what a marvelous crust they got in return. Fluke works great if you're in the Northeast. But any firm white fish will do, including tilapia, the farmed fish protein that many street corner fish taco joints use really well. Deploy a simple salsa and lime-flecked crema topping to accompany the fish, however you end up cooking it.

Ingredients

For the salsa

2 medium tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped

1 small red onion, peeled and diced

1 clove garlic, peeled and minced

¹/₂ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro

1 jalapeño pepper, halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut crosswise into half-moons (optional)

Kosher salt

For the crema

¹/₄ cup mayonnaise

¹/₂ cup sour cream

1 lime, cut in half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon canned chipotle pepper, finely chopped (optional)

For the fish

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon chili powder

1 ¹/₂ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for finishing

1 ¹/₂ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1 cup whole milk

2 pounds flounder or any firm white-fleshed fish, cut across the grain of the flesh into strips about ¹/₂ inch wide by 3 inches long

¹/₂ cup peanut oil, plus a splash more for greasing the pan

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Twenty-four 6-inch fresh corn tortillas

2 to 3 cups shredded green cabbage

Preparation

Make the salsa. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeño, if using. Add salt to taste. Make the crema. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise and sour cream until combined. Season to taste with the juice of the halved lime, the salt, the black pepper, and the chipotle, if using. Prepare the fish. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Pour the milk into another medium bowl and place the fish in it. Pour the peanut oil into a 12-inch frying pan and place over medium-high heat until it shimmers and is about to smoke. Remove the fish pieces from the milk bath and dredge them lightly through the flour mixture, shaking to remove excess. Add the butter to the pan. Place some fish pieces in the oil, without crowding them, and cook until deep golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn carefully and cook for 1 minute more. Remove to a warmed, paper towel–lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining fish. Meanwhile, lightly grease a skillet with a drizzle of oil and set over medium heat. Heat the tortillas, one or two at a time, until they are soft and hot. Keep them warm, wrapped in a dish towel if you don’t have a tortilla warmer. Fill each tortilla with 3 pieces of fish, browned side up, followed by the tomato salsa and a pinch of cabbage. Drizzle with the crema. Serve 1 or 2 tacos per person, with lime wedges and hot sauce, such as Tapatío or Frank's, on the side.

We could eliminate the greasy pan frying and simplify this multistep dish. But we soon learned that, without a pan of hot oil, the coating of crunchy panko bread crumbs refused to brown. This was easily fixed: Pretoasting the panko in the microwave with a bit of olive oil turned it richly golden. To streamline the breading process, we whisked the flour and egg together, adding garlic powder and dried oregano for flavor. We dipped our chicken in this mixture and then pressed it in the toasted panko that we'd combined with grated parmesan for an extra hit of cheesiness and an even crunchier texture. A short stint in the air fryer gave us chicken that was juicy inside and crunchy outside. We sprinkled on shredded mozzarella and cooked the cutlets just long enough to melt the cheese. A little warmed pasta sauce poured over the top kept our recipe simple and avoided soggy cutlets. Chopped basil added a fresh finish.

Serves 2

Cook Time: 13 minutes

Total Time: 45 minutes

Serve with pasta, if desired.

¾ cup panko bread crumbs

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 large egg

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

¾ teaspoon garlic powder

½ teaspoon dried oregano

Salt and pepper

2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed

2 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (½ cup)

¼ cup jarred marinara sauce, warmed

2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Toss panko with oil in bowl until evenly coated. Microwave, stirring frequently, until light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to shallow dish, let cool slightly, then stir in Parmesan. Whisk egg, flour, garlic powder, oregano, ⅛ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper together in second shallow dish. Pound chicken to uniform thickness as needed. Pat dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 breast at a time, dredge in egg mixture, letting excess drip off, then coat with panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Lightly spray base of air-fryer basket with vegetable oil spray. Arrange breasts in prepared basket, spaced evenly apart, alternating ends. Place basket in air fryer and set temperature to 400 degrees. Cook until chicken is crispy and registers 160 degrees, 12 to 16 minutes, flipping and rotating breasts halfway through cooking. Sprinkle chicken with mozzarella. Return basket to air fryer and cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Transfer chicken to individual serving plates. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons warm marinara sauce and sprinkle with basil. Serve.

The tiny cabbages caramelize and crisp while maintaining enough structure to work as a dipping vessel. Of course, deep-frying them is something of a project and doesn't yield the healthiest results. We wanted to see if we could use the air fryer to make “fried” Brussels sprouts that kept their virtuous qualities but tasted as decadent as their deep-fried counterparts. Our first attempts were promising but not perfect. Since we usually achieve crispiness (when not frying) by using a very hot oven, we tossed the Brussels sprouts in a little oil and roasted them in the air fryer at 400 degrees. They crisped up quickly but tasted raw inside: The air fryer was doing too good a job at browning. We tried adding a splash of water before cooking the sprouts, hoping the resulting steam might soften them faster, but no luck. The solution turned out to be more obvious: Lowering the heat to 350 degrees gave the sprouts time to soften on the inside while the outside crisped. The results mimicked the deep-fried sprouts so well that we were inspired to create a version with another beloved fried vegetable: crispy shallots.

Serves 4

Cook Time: 20 minutes

Total Time: 25 minutes

The Brussels sprouts are delicious with just a squeeze of lemon, but irresistible with Lemon-Chive Dipping Sauce (recipe follows). If you are buying loose Brussels sprouts, select those that are about 1½ inches long. Quarter Brussels sprouts longer than 2½ inches.

1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Lemon wedges

Toss Brussels sprouts with oil, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper in bowl; transfer to air-fryer basket. Place basket in air fryer and set temperature to 350 degrees. Cook Brussels sprouts until tender, well browned, and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes, tossing halfway through cooking. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with lemon wedges.

It's no wonder the stew is so popular — it's versatile, satisfying, makes great leftovers, and, with the right ingredients, it can be incredibly healthy.

But it's also easy to get stuck in a chili rut, making the same old beef or vegetarian version over and over. So we asked seven chefs and food bloggers, including Julia Turshen, Giada De Laurentiis, Martha Stewart, and Melissa Clark, to share their favorite chili recipes. Lucky for us — and you! — they delivered big time, offering up creative yet completely doable chili ideas. So if you've never thought of adding black-eyed peas or a dash of cocoa powder to your chili, now's the time, whether you're looking for the perfect chili for a party or you simply need a new idea for dinner tonight.

Giada De Laurentiis' Sweet Potato Chili Courtesy of Giadzy.com

""This chili is my favorite because it comes together in under an hour yet has all the flavor of a chili that has been slow simmered all day,"" says Giada De Laurentiis, who shared this beef, bean, and sweet potato chili recipe from her site Giadzy. ""This is thanks to the three different chilies and an added layer of sweetness from nutritious sweet potatoes. Added bonus: It's rich in protein while only using half the amount of meat so it leaves you full but not needing a nap.""

""This chili is the ultimate crowd-friendly, make-ahead dish when you have loved ones over,"" says Julia Turshen, the author of numerous cookbooks, including ""Feed the Resistance"", ""Small Victories"" and ""Now & Again"", as well as the founder of Equity at the Table. ""I always make the chili the day before (it tastes even better that way) and then serve the toppings (sour cream, grated cheese, avocado and scallions) on the side so everyone can mix and match to their liking. I love using black-eyed peas because they're a little unexpected in chili, but their nutty flavor and creamy texture goes beautifully, plus they're a nod to the foodways of the South, which also inspired the cast-iron cornbread that I like to serve with the chili. But by all means use whatever type of bean you love and already have in your cupboard!""

“Broiler-charred poblano chiles and a liberal dose of cumin give this hearty stew a wonderful smokiness,"" says Martha Stewart, who shared this Instant Pot-ready chili recipe from her book ""Martha Stewart's Pressure Cooker."" Stewart adds, ""Pork shoulder is an ideal cut for the pressure cooker — cubes are browned and braised for the chili base here. Serve with wedges of cornbread for a warming fall supper or the ultimate game-day entree.”

Chungah Rhee's Quinoa Chili Chungah Rhee

""This is an all-time favorite, especially during the cold winter months,"" says the blogger behind Damn Delicious, Chungah Rhee, who shared this healthy recipe from her new cookbook ""Damn Delicious Meal Prep."" Rhee adds, ""It's vegetarian, protein-packed, and the perfect bowl of comfort food that you can eat guilt-free! It's truly a win-win for all.""

Melissa Clark's Easy Weeknight Pressure-Cooker Chili Christopher Testani

When you have only 30 minutes to put together dinner yet still want something hearty, try this recipe from The New York Times contributor and cookbook author Melissa Clark. The recipe, from Clark's new pressure-cooker cookbook ""Comfort in an Instant"" calls for ground pork or beef — your choice! — plus pinto or kidney beans and easy to find spices, including chili powder and cumin. After a quick saute of the meat and vegetables, the pressure cooker completes the work of turning a few staples into an outstanding dinner.

Kelly Senyei's Slow-Cooker Chicken Chili Kelly Senyei

""When it comes to a hearty meal-in-a-bowl, it doesn't get much better than chili,"" says Kelly Senyei, who shared this recipe from her popular blog Just a Taste. "" I've lightened up this protein-packed comfort food by swapping beef for chicken and loading up on extra beans and plenty of spices (read: flavor, not fat). Tossing everything into the slow cooker takes the stress out of meal time and prevents those last-minute greasy takeout orders. Best of all, this chicken chili tastes just as great (if not better) on day two, so you'll be eating healthy all week long.""

Nik Sharma's Cocoa-Spiced Bean and Lentil Chili NIK SHARMA / Nik Sharma

Is it a soup, a stew or a chili? You won't care what it's called once you try this legume-filled dish, which gets a wonderful depth of flavor from cocoa powder. ""It was during my years spent in grad school in Cincinnati that I first got introduced to chili,"" says Nik Sharma, a blogger, San Francisco Chronicle columnist and author of the cookbook ""Season."" He adds, ""What made it special was their use of unsweetened cocoa, which helps to boost the savoriness of the dish."" Sharma took inspiration from his Cincinnati chili experiences when developing this robust vegetarian stew, which is made with creamy lentils, split peas and beans. A garnish of fresh herbs and dollop of Greek yogurt brighten the flavors and makes this chili even more satisfying.

Place the garlic cloves in the center of the baking sheet, then arrange the chicken parts, skin up, around the garlic; this prevents the garlic from scorching during roasting. Arrange the cauliflower evenly around the chicken. Roast until the thickest part of the breast (if using) reaches about 160°F and the thickest part of the largest thigh/leg (if using) reaches about 175°F, 30 to 40 minutes.

and the thickest part of the largest thigh/leg (if using) reaches about 175°F, 30 to 40 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken and cauliflower to a platter, then transfer the garlic along with 2 cauliflower florets to a medium bowl. Using a fork, mash the garlic and cauliflower mixture to a coarse paste. Carefully pour ¼ cup water onto the baking sheet, then use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits. Pour the water into the garlic-cauliflower mixture, then whisk in the yogurt, lemon juice and half the mint. The mixture should have the consistency of thin yogurt; if it is too thick, whisk in additional water 1 tablespoon at a time. Drizzle the sauce over the chicken and cauliflower and sprinkle with remaining mint.

Chungah Rhee, author of ""Damn Delicious Meal Prep"", eats this Irish stew-inspired dish in her ""no-shame sweatpants"" with a loaf of crusty bread. The genius of this one-pot dish is that it can be prepped, cooked and on the table in under an hour — and only about 15 minutes of that time requires any sweat equity from you. The rest is all done in the Instant Pot.

When the Instant Pot's cooking cycle is done, don't jump the gun and skip extra step of making the gravy. The addition of flour gives the stew a silken taste and texture that pairs nicely with those perfectly tender pieces of beef and vegetables.

This recipe makes six servings and clocks in at just under 350 calories per serving, which leaves you a little extra wiggle room for a nice pint of Guinness.

Slainte — and Happy St. Patrick's Day!

Make sure to serve the wings as hot as your fingers can bear. As the sauce cools, it can get a little gloppy, and the wings themselves will lose some of their lovely crunch. But when served steaming hot, they are hard to stop eating — and the second one tastes even better than the first.

SPICY ASIAN CHICKEN WINGS

ACTIVE TIME: 25 MINUTES

PRESSURE COOK TIME: 3 MINUTES

TOTAL TIME: 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES

YIELD: 6 TO 8 SERVINGS

FOR THE MARINATED WINGS

2 tablespoons soy sauce

2 large garlic cloves, finely grated or minced

1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, finely grated

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

21/2 to 3 pounds chicken wings

FOR THE GLAZE

1 cup mirin

3 tablespoons Sriracha or other hot sauce

Finely grated zest and juice of 2 limes

2 tablespoons soy sauce

1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

FOR FINISHING AND SERVING

Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling

1 teaspoon sesame seeds, for serving

Fresh ground black pepper, for serving

Chopped scallions or cilantro, for serving

1. Marinate the wings: In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.

2. Make the glaze: Combine the mirin, Sriracha, lime zest and juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, and pepper in the pressure cooker pot. Using the sauté function, simmer the glaze, stirring frequently, until it reduces enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Transfer about one-third of the glaze to a large bowl. Transfer another one-third to a small bowl. Reserve both bowls of glaze for later. Leave the last one-third of the glaze in the pot.

3. Add the chicken to the pot with the glaze, along with any liquid from the marinade bowl and 2 tablespoons water.

4. Lock the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. Manually release the pressure.

5. Preheat the broiler to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

6. To finish using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the chicken wings to the glaze in the large bowl and toss well (discard any liquid still in the pressure cooker pot). Arrange the wings in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the wings with some sesame oil (about a tablespoon or so, but you don’t have to measure it). Broil until they are crispy and browned, 2 to 4 minutes.

7. Transfer the wings to a serving platter and drizzle with the glaze from the small bowl. Garnish with the sesame seeds, pepper, and scallions. Serve hot.

While salads typically scream summer, you can easily winterize the healthy diet staple with a few simple tweaks — and be better equipped to stay on track with those health goals. Give these six delicious ideas a try.

ADD: WINTER FRUIT

Emily Kyle Nutrition

Cold temps offer so many tempting fruit offerings, including winter citrus like oranges and tangerines, as well as apples and delectably crunchy pomegranate arils. Citrus is packed with immunity-helping vitamin C, truly essential this time of year. It has the added benefit of helping you absorb plant-based iron from the veggies in your salad, too. And the beautiful red of pomegranate arils? You have health-helping antioxidants to thank for that rich color. Top a Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with pomegranate arils, mix apples into a Sweet Cranberry and Apple Lentil Salad, or add tangerines and grapefruit to a Winter Citrus Fruit Salad. If you’re feeling adventurous, sprinkle on a little citrus zest for added flavor.

ADD: WARMING SPICES

Lively Table

“When it comes to winterizing a salad, I think of combining ingredients that are in season like pomegranates, citrus fruits, Brussels sprouts and butternut squash — and adding warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger that are reminiscent of the holidays and colder weather,” says Kara Lydon, RD, a dietitian and yoga teacher in Boston. “Wintery spices have a warm element to them, which in turn makes us perceive the food as grounding, cozy and comforting.” Roast sweet potatoes or winter squash with cinnamon, or simply season a finished salad with a dash of freshly ground nutmeg. “Cinnamon is one of the most antioxidant-packed spices in your cabinet, and it contains antimicrobial properties that may help ward off that pesky winter cold,” says Lydon. Whip up a Turkey Wild Rice Salad, a Black Rice and Purple Brussels Sprout Salad, or a Moroccan Chickpea Salad.

ADD: GRAINS

Liz's Healthy Table

Instead of pairing a salad with whole-grain bread, why not add the whole grains directly to the salad? Any grain will work, but picks with a particularly chewy texture like farro and barley work particularly well. Plus, grains add filling fiber and plenty of vitamins and minerals. “Shake up your usual summer salad by putting your indoor grill to work!” suggests Catherine Brown, a plant-based chef in Errol, New Hampshire. “Grill peppers, squash, onions and eggplant. Then dice them, add a cooked whole grain, some fresh herbs, olives, nuts or seeds, and a flavorful vinaigrette. You'll be transported back to warm summer nights!” Or combine roasted winter veggies — think parsnips, carrots and winter squash — and pair with a black or red rice, as well as orange slices. “Choose an assortment of deep colors to get a wide variety of antioxidants,” advises Brown. Embrace the season with a Kale Salad with Roasted Delicata Squash, Farro, Pistachios, and Apricots or a Grilled Summer Veg and Kamut Salad.

ADD: COOKED WINTER VEGGIES

Edwina Clark

Nothing winterizes a salad quite like roasted sweet potatoes or steamed beets. And you don’t have to serve the veggies warm. “I love adding chunky cooked veggies to salads because they offer heartiness, texture and flavor,” says Edwina Clark, RD, a dietitian in San Francisco. “They provide an additional level of complexity that's hard to achieve with raw foods alone, and they make a salad more satisfying.” When roasted, sweet potatoes offer up a sweet flavor, plus they provide bulk (think plenty of fiber!), allowing you to forgo adding grains to your salad. “Complex carbohydrates in your salad provide energy to last you until your next meal,” says Cassidy Reeser, RD, a dietitian in Athens, Georgia. As for steamed beets, “they’re an easy way to bump up the volume without adding many calories,” notes Clark. “Beets are loaded with betalain, a group of phytonutrients with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. They also offer nitrates, which have been shown to assist with blood vessel health and endurance.” Enjoy sweet potatoes in an Autumn Salad with Roasted Chicken and beets in a Beet, Orange, and Feta Salad with Creamy Mint Dressing.

ADD: ANYTHING HEATED

How to Eat

“When it's frigid outside, a cold salad doesn't seem quite so refreshing,” says Rebecca Clyde, RDN, a dietitian in Salt Lake City, Utah. “Adding a heated component to your salad is a great way to warm up and also reduce food waste. You may not want to eat starting-to-wilt greens raw — but heat them up, and they're perfect.” Charred romaine and sautéed kale or spinach are all yummy additions. But the options don’t stop there. Add dried fruit like raisins or cranberries to your sauté pan, along with low-sodium broth — the fruit will plump up with moisture and deliciousness. Warm up with a Simple Sautéed Kale Salad or a Maple Roasted Squash and Seared Halloumi Cheese Salad.

ADD: NUTS

Beautiful Eats and Things

You’ll find nuts like pistachios, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts in your favorite wintery baked-good recipes. So why not toss the crunchy goodness to a winter salad, as well? “I love adding nuts to my winter salads to give them additional protein and texture,” says Andrea Mathis, RDN, a dietitian in Birmingham, Alabama. “Nuts have been linked with lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as inflammation associated with heart disease.” Go for the crunch with an Orange Pomegranate and Walnut Salad, an Italian Lupini Bean Salad with Crushed Pistachios, or a Kale and Chickpea Salad.

The weather outside this time of year can be seriously frightful for your scalp. Many people experience seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff — the medical names for a dry, flaky scalp — this time of year.

“The external air in the wintertime tends to be drier or less humid than in warmer months, which tends to have a drying effect on our skin, including the scalp,” explains Shari Hicks-Graham, MD, a dermatologist in Columbus, Ohio.

What’s more, indoor heating systems pump out dry air, so they have a similar effect on your scalp, while hot showers can also exacerbate dryness during the colder weather season, says Hicks-Graham. “Scalp dryness can turn into flakiness when we brush our hair or rub or scratch our head,” she adds.

Some people are prone to seborrheic dermatitis year-round, notes Lindsey Bordone, MD, dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center who specializes in hair disorders. That’s because this condition has a lot of different causes.

“Seborrheic dermatitis is often referred to as dandruff and can be the result of genetics, the environment, and your diet,” says Mona Mofid, MD, dermatologist at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego. “In some cases, there is an overgrowth of a yeast — malassezia — that normally lives on the skin but may be in excess.”

Not shampooing your hair enough can also cause dandruff due to the build-up of oils and skin cells on the scalp. Bordone says stress can also contribute to seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff.

While seborrheic and dandruff are essentially the same, dandruff only affects the scalp, while seborrheic dermatitis can cause skin irritation and flaking on other areas, like your ears, eyebrows, beard region and upper chest.

Luckily, you have a variety of treatment options to soothe your scalp, starting with natural solutions.

“Coconut and olive oil are very good for the scalp,” says Debra Jaliman, MD, dermatologist in New York City and author of “Skin Rules”. Coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and extremely nourishing thanks to the vitamins and essential fatty acids it contains, while olive oil is full of antioxidants that help protect the skin when applied topically. “A good trick is to apply one of those oils to the scalp overnight once a week, or even once a month, to give your scalp a hydrating treatment,” says Mofid.

Another natural remedy you can try: apple cider vinegar, which is antibacterial and anti-fungal, says Jaliman. (Just make sure to dilute it with water before putting it near your scalp.)

Beyond natural remedies, there are plenty of shampoos targeted to treat seborrheic dermatitis. “Some ingredients to look for which can help soothe a flaky scalp include ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, and 2% pyrithione zinc,” says Paul Cellura, MD, dermatologist at Tribeca Skin Center in New York City. “These ingredients are contained in many of the available over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos.” Glycolic acid, which is commonly used in facial chemical peels, can also be very effective on the scalp when used in modest amounts, says Hicks-Graham.

As for what not to do: “Avoid hair products that may be drying, such as hair sprays and shampoos with a high alcohol content,” advises Paradi Mirmirani, MD, dermatologist and director of hair disorders for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. “The higher up on the ingredient list, the more of the product it contains.” It’s also best to steer clear of shampoos formulated for oily scalps (these are often labeled as “cleansing” or “clarifying”) because they can contain harsh ingredients that can dry out your scalp, says Mirmirani.

The best shampoos for a dry, flaky scalp

Take care of your dandruff with one of these dermatologist-approved shampoos. But keep this in mind: “If over-the-counter products fail to fully control the scalp irritation, it may be wise to pay a visit to a board-certified dermatologist for further evaluation,” says Cerulla.

Hicks-Graham is a fan of this shampoo because it has a gentle sulfate-free formula that still lathers and feels great on your hair. Xlyitol in the formula fights yeast, while salicylic acid, glycolic acid and willow bark extract exfoliate and soothe.

Coal isn’t just for those who made the naughty list this holiday season. Ths shampoo, which Cerulla likes, relies on 1 percent coal tar to ease flaking and scalp irritation associated with seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff and scalp psoriasis.

Cerulla also likes this drugstore shampoo, which is formulated with 1 percent ketoconazole to help reduce the amount of pityrosporum yeast on the scalp and cut down on inflammation, redness and scaly patches.

Powered by 2 percent pyrithione zinc to help control dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis symptoms, this shampoo is a favorite of Mohid’s because it’s both affordable and available OTC. “For people who experience seborrheic dermatitis on the face or chest it can also be used as a wash and comes in a body wash option as well,” she says.

With 1 percent pyrithione zinc and coconut oil, this shampoo offers a one-two punch against dandruff at an inexpensive price point. “This shampoo helps to nourish dry itchy scalp and also helps to relieve it from irritation,” says Jaliman. “It’s pH balanced to gently cleanse scalp and hair.”

For mild cases of seborrheic dermatitis, Bordone says an OTC dandruff shampoo like this one can be very effective. This classic formula’s star ingredient is 1 percent pyrithione zinc, which helps improve flakiness and itchiness.

Finding time to exercise in your busy day is a win, no matter what. But choosing the right gear will take your workout to the next level.

Proper footwear ensures you’re making the most of your time in the gym, allows you to move around properly and helps prevent injuries. After all, just like you wouldn’t wear flip-flops to a business meeting, you wouldn’t want to wear shoes that hold you back from giving it all in a workout. Upgrade your worn out sneakers with these picks from some of the country’s top trainers and athletes, as well as everyday shoppers.

Best workout shoes for strength and conditioning

Whether you’re lifting dumbbells, using equipment, or just relying on your body weight to get stronger, cross-training workouts require a stable, steady shoe. That’s why Adam Rosante, a strength and mental performance coach, recommends this pair from Nike. “It’s the best training shoe out there,” he says. “It’s super durable, has great lateral stability, and provides the perfect platform for allowing your feet to fire and function naturally.”

Best women's shoes for power walking

With hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon, these breathable shoes were clearly made for walking. One customer reported that she comfortably walked 15 to 20 miles the first time she wore them, adding that they “defied the laws of physics.” “My feet have never felt lighter with shoes on,” she said.

If you love a walking workout, check out this round up of the best, most supportive walking shoes on the market.

Best women's shoes for trail running

When you take your runs onto the trails, extra cushioning is the name of the game. These lightweight but supportive shoes make off-road running so much easier, and the tread provides plenty of traction. Trail runner Tim Freriks says this brand is always his top pick: “Whether I’m on a long run through the mountains or in the Grand Canyon, I know that I'm wearing the lightest shoe without sacrificing cushion and traction.”

Best women's socks for barre classes

These ballet-inspired workout classes don’t require shoes, but you want to wear a pair of non-slip socks to help you get a better grip on the barre and on the floor. These are a top-rated option on Amazon. Reviewers call them “cute and comfortable” and report that the quality continues to hold up after many washes.

Best women's shoes for Crossfit workouts

If you’re heading to the “box” (CrossFit-speak for the gym), you’ll want to have the right shoe for your WOD (workout of the day).

This is the first-ever CrossFit shoe built specifically for women, featuring a more slender shape and narrow toe box designed specifically to suit a woman’s foot. It's also been tested and approved by CrossFit Games athletes like Chyna Cho.

“This is the lightest shoe I’ve trained in from Reebok, and translates into real-life clothing,” she says. “If I were to travel at the airport, I would totally rock this shoe and not feel like a gym rat. And they hold up so well.”

Best women's shoes for HIIT classes

For the full-body functional exercises involved in high-intensity interval training (or HIIT) classes, you want a shoe that’s flexible with a thin, flat sole and a light tread, explains Bergen Wheeler, creator of Exhale Spa’s Core Fusion HIIT classes. This pair will help you feel your feet on the ground, while giving you plenty of stability for high-intensity moves. Bonus: These come in an almost endless array of colors.

Best indoor spin women's shoes

Crush your next indoor cycling class with this pair of clip-in shoes. Designed for recreational riders, the fiberglass-reinforced sole helps boost your power output, while the synthetic leather upper enhances strength and stability. Amazon customers say they fit true to size and are “so comfy right out of the box.”

Best women's shoes for yoga

Sanuk makes shoes “for the journey to your happy place.” And if yoga class is your happy place, these sandals are the perfect thing to wear on your way there. These slip on and off easily, and the rubber soles — made out of real yoga mat material — provide enough support if you have a longer walk to class. One reviewer reports: “I wore these for the first time on an all-day walk around San Francisco. There was no break-in time needed. They handled the hills great.”

Best women's shoes for dance classes

Moving your body to Beyonce’s latest track is definitely a fun ways to break a sweat. But with all the jumping and plyometric moves in dance cardio classes, you need a shoe that’s suited for shock absorption, explains Katia Pryce, founder and creator of DanceBody. “The right shoe is super important for this type of workout because of the lateral movement and constant footwork,” she says. These Asics are “by far” the best shoe she’s found, and she recommends them to all her clients.

Best workout shoes for running

Long runs require shoes with a mix of soft cushioning with plenty of “springiness,” and these kicks deliver the perfect combination. Maegan Krifchin, a professional distance runner, says she prefers this style for their “just right” feeling: “They hug my feet but have enough give, support me but don't over-correct, and won't weigh me down,” she says. “I've gone through at least 24 pairs of Wave Riders since I started running in them!”

This lightweight, neutral shoe also provides an ideal amount of flexibility and cushioning for longer runs. Celebrity trainer Kira Stokes laces these up whenever she’s running more than five miles. “This is a neutral shoe that still allows me to feel the road beneath my feet,” she says. “They also has a nice wide toe box to allow some breathing room.”

Best women's workout shoe for any cardio

If your workouts involve a little bit of everything, this shoe is for you. Stokes likes to include some high-intensity training moves into her outdoor runs, and this pair stands up to all her cross-training needs. “This is a supportive, low profile shoe that provides just the right amount of cushioning, which allows you to maintain stability while moving in different directions,” she says.

With endless gray days and perpetual piles of snow, making the best of winter can seem a monumental task. But Scandinavians seem to have it figured out. They live in line with the idea of “hygge,” a Danish/Norwegian word that loosely translates to a feeling of coziness.

The first things that comes to mind when Americans think of “cozy” typically include soft blankets, warm slippers, and a roaring fire (or scented candles, in a pinch). But while all of those items play a role in the concept of “hygge,” that’s not all it’s about.

What typically gets lost in translation is the fact that hygge also revolves around kinship, nature and simplicity. “In essence, the world of Nordic hygge is about getting back to basics, prioritizing what’s important, and simplifying your life,” explains Signe Johansen, author of ""How to Hygge: Nordic Secrets to a Happy Life.""

In Nordic culture, hygge has just as much to do with getting out into nature as it does with getting cozy on the couch. “What is distinctively Nordic is the freedom to roam in nature at any time of year, a right that is considered sacrosanct across the region,” Johansen writes. In their philosophy, there’s no such thing as bad weather — only bad clothing. (Learn more about how to dress for winter weather here.)

They consider time spent outdoors to have profound therapeutic benefits. In fact, it’s one of three keys to the Norwegian way of life, along with “cabin porn” and an addiction to coffee, Johansen explains. The hygge lifestyle also centers on conviviality. Spending time with family, friends and loved ones (preferably around a fire or a candlelit dinner table, of course) is another crucial element of hygge that often gets overlooked.

Finally, Scandinavian design didn’t gain its worldwide reputation (hej, Ikea!) by accident. Their simplistic, minimalist yet comfortable style is another tenet of the hygge philosophy. First step is simplifying. Get rid of what’s not working, Johansen suggests. Try the “Konmari” method, popularized by Marie Kondo’s book, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up"": If it doesn’t “spark joy,” get rid of, sell, or donate it.

Next, bring in home design pieces that enhance the “hygge-ness” of your home. Think: soft furnishings and textiles — cozy throws, sheepskins and cushions in unusual or graphic prints; plants that bring nature’s hygge indoors; and of course, plenty of candles. “You can never have too many candles,” Johansen writes.

Bearing all of this in mind, we created a list of wonderful products that can help you build a true hygge lifestyle of your own, no matter where you live.

Editor's note: In the process of reviewing and updating our articles, we sometimes find that previously recommended products are outdated. As a result, we've updated this piece with newer models of the products the experts recommended below.

Scratching your head about what to get your favorite cook? We turned to some of the nation’s top food pros for their favorite gift ideas. Every pick on the list makes healthy cooking fun, fast and full of flavor, so you know each one sends a thoughtful message to friends and family on your holiday gift list. To accompany your gift, consider picking up one of our pros’ cookbooks (and cookbooks that are fall- and winter-perfect) to provide some ideas to put the new gadget to work.

This tool is a must-have in every kitchen! Katie Higgins, the healthy food blogger behind Chocolate Covered Katie, recommends this Cuisinart model. “I use this food processor to dice carrots or zucchini, shred sweet potatoes for hash browns, blend shredded coconut into butter, and to make my favorite Black Bean Brownies. I much prefer a food processor over a blender, because I find it more evenly processes all ingredients thanks to the larger surface area,” she says.

Health-supportive chef and recipe developer Danielle Krupa recommends a smaller version, Cuisinart Mini-Prep Food Processor. “It makes whipping up healthy items like hummus, fresh salsa, pesto, nut butters, energy bites, homemade baby purées and more a cinch. Plus, it’s affordable, comes in a variety of colors, is easy to clean and takes up very little kitchen space,” she says.

For cutting the perfect, evenly sliced veggies like a pro chef, nothing beats a mandolin slicer. “My absolute favorite utensil is a mandolin slicer” says Eden Grinshpan, co-founder and executive chef of DEZ, and host of Top Chef Canada, who recommends the Benriner Mandolin Slicer. “I always have a big salad on my table and it just cuts the veggies so beautifully.” A mandolin slicer makes it so easy to make gorgeous salads, which Grinshpan says encourages her to eat them more. “They're so inexpensive and a great gift!” she notes.

This versatile tool does more than create the perfect salad veggies. Ellie Krieger, RD, host of Ellie's Real Good Food on Public Television and two-time James Beard award winning cookbook author, uses hers to create nutritious chips. “My favorite healthy cooking gadget is this mandoline slicer that has various blades and a safety holder to protect your hand when slicing. It's ideal for turning fruits and vegetables — like potatoes, zucchini, apples and pear — into crisp (healthful) chips in the oven.”

Though luxe gifts may be alluring, chefs prize simple gadgets, too. Chloe Coscarelli, vegan chef and author of ""CHLOE FLAVOR"", recommends this mini offset spatula. “This tool is small but mighty, and it's less than $5.00, which makes it the perfect stocking stuffer!” she says. Coscarelli explains what makes this gift so great: “It allows for perfect wrist action whether you're spreading avocado on toast or frosting on cupcakes. I've even frosted an entire wedding cake with it. Oh, and you can never have too many because they tend to get lost!”

Any home cook will appreciate this multi-tasking tool. “It’s great for pureeing vegetable or lentil soups right in the pot, making homemade sauces, salad dressings, and more,” says Chef Jerran Boyer of Health Nut Chefs, who recommends this Cuisinart hand blender. “It’s one of the best tools a chef or home cook can have in their kitchen!”

If the cook on your gift list doesn’t already have this jack-of-all-trades, you’re going to want to grab one of these popular appliances. Among the various models, Dana Angelo White, RD, author of the ""Healthy Instant Pot Cookbook"" and the ""Healthy Air Fryer Cookbook"", suggests the Instant Pot 6-QT Duo Plus 60 or the slightly older and lower-priced Instant Pot 6-Qt Duo 60.

“Pressure cooking prepares food quickly and conveniently, plus the high pressure also helps retain nutrients,” says White, who praises the Instant Pot’s versatility. “You can also sauté, slow cook and bake (yes, bake) in the Instant Pot.” According to White, the 6-QT version is the perfect size for making large batches of soup, chili, pulled pork and pasta as well as lightened up desserts like cheesecake, poached pears and crème brulee. And if the person on your gift list is into #mealprep, the Instant Pot will come in handy. “It’s my secret weapon for healthy meal prep,” says White. “I make bulk batches of oatmeal, hard cooked eggs, sweet potatoes, brown rice, beans and Greek yogurt for the week ahead.”

White is also a fan of the air fryer. “Which air fryer you choose really depends on how many people you’re cooking for,” she notes. If you’re gifting an air fryer to a couple, White recommends the Phillips Viva. “It’s a great basic and affordable model and perfect for cooking for two.” For larger families, she suggests the Phillips Avance XL; for the cook who entertains, there’s even an XXL model.

“The biggest secret about air fryers is just how useful they can be for all kinds of cooking. Of course, there’s the appeal of lighter, non-fried versions of chicken wings and fish sticks, but you can also make egg sandwiches, shrimp scampi and spiced nuts,” explains White. “Vegetable dishes, like glazed carrots, kale chips, and stuffed mushrooms are some of the recipes I make the most,” she says. According to White, the air fryer acts like a mini convention oven, circulating hot air around the food, leaving it evenly cooked and crispy on all sides. That means that recipes that typically call for a ton of oil often need none (or a couple of teaspoons at the most) so the calorie savings can really stack up!

Here’s another small but mighty must-have for the healthy home cook in your life. “I use the Microplane zester for grating everything from garlic and ginger, to lime, orange, nutmeg and dried lime,” says Najmieh Batmanglij, whose newest cookbook, ""Cooking in Iran: Regional Recipes and Kitchen Secrets"" was just named one of 2018’s best cookbooks by The New York Times. “I’ve also used the gadget for some unexpected ingredients, like goat cheese, cooked potatoes, tomatoes and cucumber for my famous yogurt soup,” she adds. According to Bagmanglij, the zester is an easy way to add flare to a variety of dishes. She recommends the Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater, which has a long, easy-to-hold handle.

This luxury appliance is on every home cook’s wish list. Genevieve Ko, the author of ""Better Baking: Wholesome Ingredients, Delicious Desserts"" explains why: “Because a stand mixer makes baking so easy, I never have to buy store-bought treats, which are loaded with a lot more sugar than I like and, sometimes, mystery ingredients that can't possibly be good for anybody. Homemade is always better for you than store-bought because you know exactly what's going into the goodies. Plus, they taste better!” Ko’s pro pick is the KitchenAid stand mixer. “I have both the smaller tilt head one, as well as the larger bowl lift one. During this busy baking season, I often have both running at the same time!” Ko also recommends the pasta maker attachment, which makes a great gift for cooks whose kitchens are already stocked with this workhorse. “It’s great for simple homemade pasta, but also works for rolling out thin, sturdy cracker or cookie dough,” she says.

According to Sammi Haber Brondo, MS RD, author of ""The Essential Vegetable Cookbook"", a blender makes the perfect gift. “Blenders are one of my favorite, must-have kitchen tools. They're extremely versatile and can be used in so many different, easy recipes. Aside from smoothies, you can puree roasted veggies with broth to make soup, mix ingredients (like banana, oats and eggs) for healthy pancakes, or even mix brownie ingredients to bake brownies,” she says. Her choice: The Magic Bullet because it's inexpensive, easy to usenand easy to clean. A nice insulated, reusable water bottle can keep smoothies cool for hours and is a stocking stuffer to go alongside the Magic Bullet.

Cookbook author Melissa d'Arabian suggests a spiralizer for any home cook who doesn’t have one. “An inexpensive one is a great gift because it's low-pressure. Super fancy models require an investment of time as well as trial and error. But an inexpensive model just begs to be tried out with a zucchini right away,” she explains. D’Arabian has this gift idea for someone special on your list: “Give the spiralizer plus a few jars of high-quality pasta sauces.”

Between year-end cash appreciation tips, plane tickets back home, holiday parties, and, of course, all those Christmas presents for your nearest and dearest, December can wreak havoc on your wallet.

Luckily, you don’t have to spend big bucks to get somebody a gift they’re bound to cherish. A perfect gift is a thoughtful one — perhaps with an added dash of whimsy, humor, glamour or practicality. And fortunately, some of the best gifts fit for the holidays clock in at a relatively affordable price: under $30, to be precise.

Personalized gifts — or gifts that allow the recipient to personalize their creations — are the closest to thoughtfulness you can get without being specific. Using a code that's included with the reel viewers, you'll be able to add any images you want into an old school reel that you can pull out whenever and view, no LED screens involved.

Like any diary, this one is designed to help you remember life's significant moments — except it's offline and more tactile than an online photos folders.

Best comfortable travel accessories

One of the notable features of this coat is that it’s made with a down alternative that keeps you warm but compresses down tightly for easy packing or stuffing into a bag.

Meet the travel neck pillow that’s designed to be exceptionally comfortable. This pillow wraps around your neck without compromising your ability to sport headphones or earbuds,. It’s also machine washable, and you can stuff it down into a tiny bag for easy transport.

We felt compelled to mention Ostrich Pillow’s other unique travel gift idea: a travel eye mask that won’t slip off your face. It wraps in such a way as to block virtually all the light out, too. The fact that it wraps around your head (versus sitting on top of your face) helps send you into relaxation mode faster, akin to the way weighted blankets calm you.

This packable blanket is here to improve your comfort in two ways: One, it can be zipped up as a compact travel pillow. Second: It’s waterproof (that will help with spills or rain). And finally, it unfolds into a warm and well-sized blanket, clocking at a cool 60 inches by 40 inches.

The recently launched Wool Runner Mizzles gives you the allbirds-style and features in a water-resistant pair of shoes.

Best travel skincare products

While some oil is good for your skin, a lot of it isn’t great. Dermatologists recommend skincare routines that regularly clean up pores and keep oiliness at bay,. One of the most beloved sunscreens of dermatologists, says Lisa Pruett, MD, a dermatologist in Carrollton, Texas. Pruett told NBC News that it can double as a moisturizer, too.

This coconut oil- and shea butter-infused deodorant glides on smooth and stops unwanted smells with odor-neutralizing ingredients like baking soda.

The sample pack comes with five scents, including Eucalyptus & Mint, Charcoal, Citrus & Herbal Musk (for the men’s travel pack), and Coconut & Vanilla, Lavender & Rose, and Cucumber & Mint (for the women’s travel pack).

This Nordstrom-exclusive is a collection of two mini-sized unisex eau de parfums. There’s Santal 33, described as a spicy, leather, musky unisex fragrance. And then there is AnOther 13, a marriage between musk and jasmine, moss, and ambrette seed absolute. Together, they should cover most olfactory needs.

This soothing roller ball is filled with essential oils: lavender, vetivert, and patchouli, a blend designed to relieve stress and tension. Applying the oils to pulse points before bed (or after takeoff) is a natural way to encourage some well-earned sleep.

Choosing the perfect inexpensive gift for your co-workers can be a challenge. You don’t want to spend too much, get too personal, or give something offensive to your workplace's nearest and dearest. But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with boring gift cards, baked goods and scented candles.

Finding the perfect gift for a fitness fanatic (like a new fitness or health tracker) can be a difficult proposition. Whether it’s running, cycling, yoga or tennis, athletes take their craft seriously — and often have seriously specific preferences for everything from gear to accessories.

So we saved you the anguish of blindly wandering around a sporting goods store by rounding up a slew of incredible, covetable and (most importantly!) highly-rated fitness gifts. From smart water bottles to the best fitness watch, these are our 19 favorite items, all designed to help get your gym-goer giftee into high-gear (or get a newbie started on the right foot).

Best fitness and wearable tech gifts

Headphones can make or break a workout (who hasn't had the frustration of having them fall out, get tangled or run out of battery in the middle of a workout?). Specifically designed for strenuous activity, these popular Bluetooth wireless headphones are both sweat- and water- resistant, have a six-hour battery-charge life, stay securely in place during rigorous workouts and respond to voice prompts.

Give the gift of boutique fitness to friends who love trying new workout trends — from running clubs to spin classes and strength training classes — but are less enthusiastic about shelling out the chunk of change for a class. Connected to more than 10,000 fitness studios in over 50 major cities globally, there's likely to be a Classpass hub near you (or one you can try while traveling!). With gift cards available in electronic form (and sent right to the recipients inbox) you can choose whatever amount you’d like to give (and get it there STAT if you're running low on time to send a gift).

From automatically recognizing and tracking half a dozen exercises to keeping up with more than 30 others, Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch Active2 is a great gift for any tech-forward person who cares about their fitness. It works with all Android smartphones, iPhones, and Samsung smartphones. And this watch is packed with features and capabilities: Bluetooth connectivity for music and media, water resistance allowing it to be submerged up to 50 meters, built-in microphone and speakers for phone calls, interchangeable bands for personal customization and more.

Opting for a digital scale will make keeping track of your weight much easier. Step on and step off, and led t he scale do all the work. It calibrates automatically and a backlit LCD display makes it very easy to read. Want to have your scale automatically keep track of your numbers? Consider Etekcity's highly-rated smart digital scale.

When it comes to your office, sitting down creates some requirements to keep you healthy and out of pain. One thing you can do to get some movement into an otherwise motionless workday is desk fitness. And to that, the highly-rated Cubii Pro under-desk elliptical is a good start. It provides a low-impact workout for you at your desk (or at home) with smooth gearing that stays quiet so it won't bother your coworkers. On top of that, Bluetooth connectivity mean you can connect it to your smartphone and keep track of your workouts, routines and achievements.

Personal trainers can run you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars — which is why the person on your list with lofty fitness goals in the new year is going to appreciate you for gifting them an annual subscription to Aaptiv.

151,2018-04-10 14:15:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-get-out-debt-build-wealth-snowball-ncna864111,How to get out of debt and build a 'wealth snowball',"For many people, getting out of debt may seem impossible. But if you focus on paying more than what’s owed on your minimum monthly balance, it might be easier than you realize, according to Get Rich Slowly founder J.D. Roth.

“The whole idea is you’re just trying to throw as much money as possible at these debts so you get them paid off quickly,” Roth tells NBC News BETTER.

Roth calls this the “debt snowball,” a method made popular by businessman and author Dave Ramsey.

First, build a “debt snowball”

Let’s say you have five debts that total $1,000 a month. Eventually, you pay off one of those debts, and bring down your monthly payment to $800. Instead of paying the minimum, you continue paying $1,000 until your debts are all fully paid.

That includes using any raises, bonuses or windfalls to pay off those debts, Roth says.

“You just continue to throw that money at your debt repayment and by doing so — as you’re making more than minimum payments — the debt gets repaid much more quickly,” Roth says.

The blogger said he used the method to get out of $35,000 of consumer debt when he was in his mid-30s.

“It took 39 months [just over 3 years] to pay off the $35,000 once I started focusing on it,” Roth says.

Once you’re out of debt, build a “wealth snowball”

For many people who manage to pay off their debts, staying out of debt becomes the new struggle, according to Roth.

“I know a lot of people who have gotten out of debt, and once they do they’re kind of lost,” he says. “They don’t know what to do with their money next. So they go out and they start spending again, and it’s kind of like losing weight … they get into the same problems they used to have where they’re spending too much.”

You can avoid this problem by building a “wealth snowball,” he says. Instead of spending the $1,000 you were putting toward your debts, he explains, “Use that $1,000 a month to save for the future.”

You can put the money towards a retirement account, savings for a house or for your children’s college education, he says. It all depends on your personal needs.

“Start building a wealth snowball where you’re socking the money away every month in a retirement account, preferably, because they carry tax advantages. But if not retirement accounts, then in investment accounts where you’re getting returns on your investments, and these returns can compound over time, creating this wealth snowball that’s similar to a debt snowball.”

Cut back on unnecessary expenses

There are ways you can probably contribute to a wealth snowball that you don’t realize, according to Roth.

One of the biggest expenses most people can cut back on, he says, are subscriptions and recurring monthly expenses.

“Nowadays, it’s a big thing to try to get consumers to sign up for subscription services,” Roth says. “Everything from Netflix to even Microsoft Office is subscription based.”

Individually, these subscriptions may seem small, but can add up. And getting rid of at least one can give you extra money to contribute to your wealth snowball.

“What I encourage people to do is to keep a close eye on the recurring monthly expenses because they act as an anchor dragging you down so that you’re not able to increase that gap between your earnings and your spending,” Roth says.

You don’t need to be rich

How much you can contribute to your wealth snowball depends on how much you can afford. If you don’t make a lot, Roth says, it doesn’t mean you can’t save.

“If you’re struggling to get by because your income is low, then it’s going to be tough for you to save say $100 or $250 or $500 a month,” says Roth. “If that’s the case, just make it a target to save $10 or $25 or $50 a month. Every little bit helps.”

And if you can afford to, says Roth, you should contribute as much as you can to a retirement account. For some people, that means contributing 5 percent of their income to a retirement account. For others, it means contributing as much as 50 percent.

“The more aggressive you get,” he says, “the sooner you can retire.”

The most important thing, according to Roth, is that you make an effort to save.

“Whatever you want to accomplish is going to come from that gap between your earning and your spending,” Roth says.

How to build a “wealth snowball”

Step 1: Let’s say you just paid off a credit car bill, bringing your total minimum balances on all your debt from $1,000 to $800. Instead of paying the minimum, continue paying $1,000 until your debts are all fully paid. That includes using any raises, bonuses or windfalls to pay off those debts.

Step 2: Once you’re out of debt, build a “wealth snowball”: Now that your debt is repaid, begin contributing the same $1,000 a month to an investment account where it will build interest over time. The more you contribute, the bigger your wealth snowball will grow.

Step 3: To contribute as much as you can to your wealth snowball, cut back on as many unnecessary recurring expenses as possible.

Remember: You don’t need to be rich: Contribute as much money as you afford, whether it’s $200 or $10 a month. Every bit will help.

152,2018-04-07 21:45:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/i-gave-my-credit-card-month-learned-ton-about-my-ncna860801,I gave up my credit card for a month — and learned a lot about my spending habits,"The way some people can’t resist trying the latest workout craze, trendy fashions or exotic superfoods, I can’t find enough ways to challenge myself to be better at budgeting and trying new methods to save more money for the future.

I tried a spending ban last fall, and, like any crash dieter, quickly fell back into my old spending habits. When I came into 2018 with a fresh outlook on my finances and a credit card bill that put me in denial, it was time to take another, hopefully more permanent, stab at overhauling my spending. I tried to change things directly at the source of the problem and took up a “cash diet” — meaning no credit cards, electronic payments, Uber, Venmo, Starbucks apps, you name it — for a month.

Sounded easy enough at first, right? Just stop using my credit cards? After a conversation with NBC News financial editor Jean Chatzky, I wasn’t so sure.

“You get the psychology behind credit cards, and the reason they’re so easy [...] the money goes so fast because it seems less real,” Chatzky says of electronic payments.

“The reason this is such a good exercise is because you have no idea how the money is flowing,” Chatzky says, after prompting several spending categories I hadn’t thought of on my own (including iTunes storage, recurring Amazon purchases, and movie ticketing apps, to name a few). I had no real idea of how pervasive electronic payment was in my financial life, and how little I knew about my own spending, despite monitoring it regularly.

Chatzky recommended going cold turkey, sticking fast to the no credit card rule, and staying on task for an entire month to get in a full billing cycle. I was allowed to keep using my credit cards for recurring bill payments, and I could write checks, but any daily expenses had to be made in cash.

My personal goals were to see if I could actually stay within my budget, and really learn where my money was going. If there’s anything I learned from talking with Jean, it’s that I think I know a lot more than I actually do.

Armed with these parameters and a visit to the ATM, I was as ready as I’d ever been to go credit card-free.

WEEK ONE: GOODBYE, SWEET STARBUCKS APP; HELLO, REALITY

The night before my “diet”, I wrote out my budget for the week, breaking down my spending into the categories I’d really be using (more or less: groceries and everything else), and planning out my spending based on my social calendar and everyday needs. Since I wouldn’t be using leftover gift cards through coffee apps, I’d have to budget for coffee as a semi-new expense and build in a little cushion, just to play it safe. To help keep things organized, I implemented a very high-tech system — using envelopes to keep cash in different budgets.

I also knew my roommates and I would be heading to Costco later in the month — I plucked $20 straight from my “everything else” envelope and into a “Costco” labeled one to try and build myself a buffer — it’s never an inexpensive trip for me.

My first week without plastic was not without road bumps. I was in for a rude awakening at the grocery store. I usually consider myself pretty on top of my grocery spending — but only because I stay under my “budget” at three different stores, and regrettably, that math doesn’t always add up. I walked into Trader Joe’s, cash in hand, and I could feel my anxiety kick in. Could I upgrade to Cara Cara instead of navel oranges? Was it a better deal to buy a bar of chocolate or a bag of peanut butter cups? Was that kombucha really going to enrich my life experience, or should I spend the $3.50 elsewhere?

Between the two grocery stores where I usually shop, the greenmarket stand on the corner, and a midweek banana restock, I came 54 cents in under budget on groceries, but that was a little too close for comfort. I added “staying comfortably within my grocery budget” to my list of goals.

Additionally, I’d just started drinking after a month-long hiatus, and an unexpected social event on a weeknight had me caving in to a drink — inadvertently, at a spot that didn’t take cash. The waitress (bless her) fronted the money on her own credit card, I gave her the cash, and had my first unplanned deficit in the “other” budget.

I quickly realized the challenge of not being able to use money I don’t already have, and how that can impact my social life. I have a habit of thinking of my social spending and my essential-but-not-planned-for spending as different parts of my budget, but they definitely are not. If my weekly budget is $100 one week, it seems like I can definitely get a new bottle of nail polish, order an extra drink at happy hour and take a cab home, right? Except that I also have two doctors appointments that will have $10 copays, and need more toothpaste, and completely forgot my grandma’s birthday and I have to get her a card, and some more stamps, and since I’m in the drugstore anyway I’m also out of ibuprofen... That one budget can shrink a lot, regardless of how it works in my brain. I wanted to challenge myself to overcome this mental separation without making myself crazy or feel like I was missing out on a lot of fun. I’d be choosing “stuff” and activities more wisely, not neglecting experiences I really wanted.

WEEK TWO: COSTCO COUNTS AS AN EMERGENCY...RIGHT?

Socially, I was faced with a couple of challenges in week two. I knew I was already over budget because of the Costco run. I had a night in with the girls on the books (Seamless was a given for us), lunch with a friend from out of town, and drinks with my sketch comedy teammates after our latest show, in addition to all of the things I’d need to get through a normal week.

During week two, I had to grin and bear the great financial temptation of heading to Costco, and I was ready to fight it as much as possible. I walked in armed with a carefully planned list of things my roommates and I would share, as well as essentials I wanted to stock up on. I came with a list, I stuck to the list, and I still spent a lot of money (about two weeks’ worth of grocery money, to be exact). As I had a minor meltdown next to the shampoo, my roommate pointed out that these were all items I’d be using more or less every day — even if the sticker shock was high, it would be a worthwhile investment in the long run.

Costco’s credit card rules ended up hurting me — although my roommate had planned to use her card given my diet, I had to use mine since the membership is in my name. Putting over $300 worth of bulk items on a (debit) card seemed emergency enough to me.

My plan to pay off my Costco “debt” ASAP was to come in under budget on groceries for the remainder of the month ... and I didn’t quite succeed. I was quickly learning that timing is everything when budgeting. I needed to stock up on some everyday staples (for me, vinegar, tea, almonds and some frozen veggies), and that emptied out my “groceries” envelope sooner than I had planned.

My second credit card snafu came when I sat down to file my taxes — no way to pay that e-filing fee in cash. I took note in my spending spreadsheet and planned to pay myself back from my refund.

A few unexpected expenses popped up, too — in a moment of weakness, I grabbed a quick bite from my neighborhood deli, I needed to buy a sympathy card, and dole out the cash for a prescription that I thought would be covered by my insurance. And I was in desperate need of dry cleaning — but that would have to wait until the budget balanced out.

WEEK THREE: BALANCING ACT

My social calendar this week, fortunately, revolved around beer — a cheap way to have a good time. I was able to keep a Friday night out and celebratory drinks with my comedy teammates to under $30 (thank goodness for happy hour). But, this week, I needed to actually buy things that weren’t groceries, and I was anxious about making it all work.

I was already a little tight on cash (I picked up some OTC medication, which was not as cheap as I would have liked, on my first day), and knew I’d need to start stocking up on other things that I’d been putting off replacing. I wasn’t entirely sure I could have a social life and go shopping the same week.

Although I’m not a big online clothing shopper, I do use Amazon quite frequently for pantry items and beauty products and was starting to feel the burn of not having that easy access to so many items (or that sweet, sweet Prime shipping). I’d been wistfully adding replacement tubes of lip balm, peanut butter and books to my cart, biding my time for a new month to start. Not the best practice during my month off from cards, I know, but not being able to buy things instantly forced me to reconsider those purchases and decide what was really important."
153,2018-07-06 21:25:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-50-20-30-rule-can-help-you-get-out-ncna889476,How the 50-20-30 rule can help you get out of debt and save money,"If you are struggling to save money and pay off debt, the 50-20-30 rule can help you budget in accordance with your financial goals, according to Rob Berger, founder of The Dough Roller. He says the simple rule provides flexibility, whether you want to pay off debt, save, invest or all three.

The rule splits your after-tax, take-home pay into three buckets.

“Fifty percent is for needs, thirty percent is for wants, twenty percent is for savings,” Berger tells NBC News BETTER.

Here’s the breakdown.

50 percent: Includes rent/mortgage, food, bills, minimum debt payments and other essentials

20 percent: Includes financial goals such as savings, investment, etc

30 percent: Dining, entertainment, etc

Figure out how much you can realistically save

Before you begin, you’ll need to determine out how much you can realistically save, says Berger.

For example, someone with high expenses and high debt may need to adjust the rule to 80-10-10 until they have reduced their debt and grown their savings.

But before you assume you can’t afford to save 20 percent, Berger advises, take the time to examine your spending habits.

“Rather than immediately say, ‘Oh, this won’t work, I can’t save 20 percent — which I understand, I’ve been there, most people have been there — spend some time thinking ‘Well, wait a minute, if I had to make this work, what choices could I make to make it work?’ Think through all the things you absolutely must have,” advises Berger.

“You got to focus on what you absolutely have to have, and that means really shrinking that 30 percent bucket — getting rid of everything you don’t have to have,” says Berger. “Which is not always easy and not always fun, but if you find yourself in a difficult financial situation, you’ve got to make those tough decisions.”

What can you cut out?

You might be overspending money in ways you don’t realize, says Berger. First, look at your major expenses — rent, mortgage, car payments, etc. — and ask yourself if there are ways to reduce them, he says. You might be able to save by moving to a cheaper city, for instance, or by purchasing a used car instead of a new one, he says.

If it’s not possible to cut back on major expenses, then you need to take a look at your smaller expenses, says Berger.

Go through the list of expenses in your 50 percent bucket and ask yourself: “Do I need this? Can I get rid of it, or can I somehow lower it?”

“If you haven’t checked car insurance rates in three years [for example] maybe you should shop around for better car insurance,” says Berger.

You’ll also need to examine the expenses in your 30 percent bucket to see what you tend to waste money on the most, he says. For some people, that may be clothes, for others, electronics or eating out. Berger suggest creating a mini-budget that will prevent you from overspending on your lifestyle habits. For instance, if you tend to splurge on dining out, create a dining budget that aligns with your savings goals.

“So you don’t have to track every dime if you don’t want to, just pick those one or two or three categories that cause you the most problems and set a budget that you don’t surpass for those categories,” says Berger.

He says there are plenty of online tools like YNAB that can help you manage your spending.

Figure out your savings goals

How you manage your 20 percent savings bucket will depend on your personal goals, says Berger.

If you don’t already have much saved, he suggests using it to build an emergency savings fund. Once you’ve got an amount you feel comfortable with, he says, you can start contributing part of your savings to an investment like an IRA or a mutual fund.

If your goal is to pay off debt, he says, you can start designating a percentage of your 20 percent bucket to pay above the minimum on your loans until they are paid off.

If debt isn’t an issue for you, he says, you can contribute part or all of the 20 percent to a retirement fund. But in most cases, Berger warns, investing 20 percent won’t be enough if you want to retire early.

“I would say you’re probably looking at at least 30 percent or higher and, again, it depends on how quickly you want to retire,” he says.

This financial calculator can help you figure out how much you’ll need to invest to retire early.

Control your wants and live beneath your means

Berger says the biggest challenge for most people using the 50-30-20 rule is controlling their wants and living beneath their means. He says this may especially be a struggle for young professionals getting a job for the first time.

“You’re getting the job with a little bit of money and you want as nice a car as you can afford, and you want as nice an apartment as you can afford, and then you sit back and you say ‘Oh, I can’t save 20 percent, that’s impossible.’ And it’s not impossible, it’s just that choices have been made that put you in a box that makes it really difficult,” he says.

Berger knows from experience. After graduating from law school in the 1990s, Berger was tens of thousands of dollars in debt. On top of that, he struggled with mortgage, car payments and other monthly expenses that piled up.

Through careful budgeting, he says his debts were paid off by 2016. He says the main reason he and his wife are now debt-free is because they continued to live beneath their means even as they paid off their loans.

“We live in the same house that we lived in — we bought it 14 years ago, it’s the same house we lived in when we made a lot less money,” he says.

Berger says they also contributed their savings to an investment account as they paid off their debt, which grew their nest egg.

“So we kept our lifestyle the same even while our income went up and we put all of that to pay down that debt… in saving and investing,” he says.

Berger’s advice to those who want to be debt free is simple: make a promise to yourself to not get into more debt.

“And to me the biggest struggle is just making that decision not to get into any more debt for any reason and sticking to it,” Berger says.

154,2018-12-04 02:50:15+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-50-50-path-helped-one-couple-pay-their-mortgage-ncna943196,How the '50/50 path' helped one couple pay off their mortgage in four years,"Michigan couple Andy and Nicole Hill, 36, paid off their mortgage in four years by living on just half their monthly income.

When they got married in 2011, the Hills vowed to achieve their goal off paying off their $50,000 in consumer debt before purchasing a home.

That’s when they decided to take the “50/50 path” — living on just half their monthly income, says Andy Hill, founder of Marriage, Kids and Money.

“We decided if we’re going to have a great life together and show our kids how to be financially responsible before they come into the world, why don’t we try to clobber this debt as soon as possible?” says Hill.

Staying on the 50/50 path allowed the couple to pay off their debt in about a year, says Hill.

By the time they were ready to buy their four-bedroom home in Bloomfield, Michigan in 2012, they had saved enough money for a 40 percent down payment.

“That got us to that $195,000 mortgage mark,” recalls Hill.

Shortly after, Nicole quit her job to stay home with their two children, Hill says. But he says they’ve continued to live on 50 percent of their income.

“It’s made a lot of difference in our family’s ability to build wealth and to just protect our family,” he says.

Adopt the zero-based budget

The 50/50 path requires you to become conscious about how you spend, Hill says.

The Hills embraced the “zero-based budget,” a simple budget where you allocate every dollar to a specific task.

For example, if you are making $5,000 a month, you would allocate each dollar to your expenses, your savings, your debt, and any other obligations, so that your bottom line comes to zero, explains Hill.

“That way you are allocating all of your dollars to a specific function as opposed to them fluttering away and not being assigned to anything,” he explains.

To reduce spending, the couple cut their grocery purchases by a third, switched from cable to antenna, and negotiated their cell phone bills.

Figure out a timeline that works for you

Look at your income and your expenses. Figure out a realistic time frame for when you plan to have your mortgage paid, and commit to it, Hill says.

If you don’t make a big salary, Hill says, it’s still possible to pay off your mortgage quickly — it will just take a bit more time.

“Maybe it’s 10 years — that’s still incredible,” he says. “Maybe it’s 15 years,” he adds, “that’s a lot quicker than the majority of America right now.”

Get a mortgage that is no more than 25 percent of your take home pay

A big reason the Hills were able to pay off their mortgage quickly is because they purchased their $350,000 home at a price well under what they could afford.

Hill, a salesman for an event marketing company, says he and his wife didn’t want to spend more than 25 percent of their take-home pay on monthly mortgage payments.

“That allowed us to have some fun and pay for our transportation, and going out and having family fun, and going on vacation without feeling like the mortgage is taking over our lives,” says Hill.

If possible, get a 15-year mortgage

The Hills chose a 15-year mortgage over the traditional 30-year. While the monthly payments were higher, they paid more towards the principal and less in interest, Hill says, which he estimates saved them around $100,000 in the long term. What’s more, the larger payments motivated them to pay off the mortgage as quickly as possible, he adds.

“I kind of wanted to add that added pressure to allow us to pay back the mortgage faster,” says Hill.

The mortgage is paid, now what?

Now that the Hills have paid off their mortgage, they can focus on their next goal: saving up for their first rental property.

“We want to buy a rental property, rent it out in metro Detroit, and have some monthly recurring passive income that we can use to cover our daily expenses,” says Hill.

Hill says paying off his mortgage in four years took many sacrifices, but was worth it in the long run.

“It’s for a season, a period of time, maybe tightening things up a little bit, figuring out a way to increase the income, but once you reach that mark, you have the ability to make some choices that really can impact your life,” Hill says.

How to pay off your mortgage quickly

Take the “50/50 path”: Live off half your monthly take-home pay, and save the rest.

Live off half your monthly take-home pay, and save the rest. Adopt the “zero-based budget”: Make sure every dollar you make is allocated to either debt payment, savings, expenses, etc. This will force you to become more conscious of how you spend.

Figure out a timeline that works for you: Look at your income and your expenses. Then set a goal for when you can realistically pay off your mortgage, and commit to it.

Look at your income and your expenses. Then set a goal for when you can realistically pay off your mortgage, and commit to it. Get a mortgage that is no more than 25 percent of your take-home pay: This will ensure you have enough money to quickly pay down your debt and still have enough to have fun.

This will ensure you have enough money to quickly pay down your debt and still have enough to have fun. If possible, get a 15-year mortgage: Your monthly payment will be higher, but you’ll save big on interest in the long term.

155,2018-11-03 13:03:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-couple-paid-65-000-credit-card-debt-student-loans-ncna930401,"How this couple paid off $65,000 in credit card debt and student loans in five years","Five years ago, Tammy, 52, and Dennis Gray, 54, owed $65,000 in credit card debt and student loans. After their son and daughter went off to college, the empty nesters realized they wanted more from life than being in debt.

“We knew we needed to do something because it wasn’t going to get better,” Tammy tells NBC News BETTER.

The Pennsylvania couple say they tried different techniques, but nothing worked. “We could never stay disciplined,” says Dennis, a pastor at a church in Kingston, PA.

The couple eliminated their debt through what they call “visualization.”

They combined the envelope system, a method of using visualization to stow away extra cash, with the debt snowball method, where you pay more than your minimum payment on your credit cards.

The couple also made moves to reduce their spending. They began eating less expensive meals, and cut back on things they didn’t need, like cable. They say switching to an antenna, which provided 20 channels for free, saved them a big chunk of cash each month.

How the envelope system works

Figure out the categories where you tend to spend the most. For example: Mortgage, savings, car payment, bills, credit cards. Designate an envelope for each category.

Every time you have extra cash, you’ll put a percentage in each envelope. How much will depend on your unique needs.

For example,

Mortgage: 50 percent

Savings: 10 percent

Car payment: 10 percent

Bills: 10 percent;

Credit cards: 20 percent

Tammy, a missionary, says the envelope system allowed them to see what steps they needed to take to get out of debt.

“It just became very clear how to make the money work,” she says.

Tammy says using an electronic version of the system allowed her to automate money from her paychecks directly into each category.

“You don’t have to think about it, once you designate that’s how you want to break it down,” she says.

Combining the snowball method

After sitting down with a financial coach, the Grays say they were shocked to see how much money they were paying in interest on credit card debt.

“I remember crying,” says Tammy.

“What opened up our eyes was how much interest we paid on the credit card alone, not counting the principal,” adds Dennis. “That really motivated us to pay it off quickly.”

The Grays began to apply the “snowball method” to paying down their massive credit card debt.

The method requires you to pay more than what you owe on your minimum monthly credit card payments. How much you contribute will depend on your unique needs and circumstances. The key is to continue paying it off at the same amount or more, even as the amount you owe decreases.

Over time, the Grays’ credit card debt began to go down, which means they could increase the amount they contributed to paying off their debt.

After five years, they made their last credit card payment in September.

“That’s an amazing feeling,” says Tammy.

Now that their credit card debt is eliminated, the couple is focused on paying off their home loan. Since they no longer have to pay off credit cards, they can afford to double the monthly payments to their their mortgage.

The couple say their son and his wife, recently married, plan to use the same system to manage their own money.

“My heart is very emotional that they won’t go through what we did,” Tammy says.

156,2020-10-23 21:01:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/why-rapper-killer-mike-s-next-big-project-starting-bank-ncna1244279,Why rapper Killer Mike's next big project is starting a bank,"In the wake of the death of George Floyd — as the Black community in Atlanta reacted to another senseless killing at the hands of the police — Killer Mike, the rapper and activist, asked his neighbors to resist rioting and take a different kind of action. “If you sit in your homes tonight, instead of burning your home to the ground, you will have time to properly plot, plan, strategize and organize and mobilize in an effective way,” he said. For months he's been encouraging others to take their anger and turn it into productive action.

Now he is channeling his own advice and teaming up with former Atlanta mayor and civil rights icon, Andrew Young, to start a digital bank to serve Black and Latino communities who are underserved by the financial services industry.

When we say underserved, here’s what that looks like: About 17 percent of Black households don’t have bank accounts compared to just 3 percent of white households. And Black-owned small businesses are about half as likely to obtain bank loans as white-owned businesses.

Young and Killer Mike’s new plan, the Greenwood Bank Initiative, is hoping to change exactly that. Killer Mike joined me on MSNBC — and later on a panel at Operation HOPE’s annual meeting — to discuss how he plans to revolutionize banking in Black and Latino communities.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: Mike, when you told people to get active and be productive, I think most of us thought you were talking about social justice. Why start a bank?

KILLER MIKE: Well, they go hand in hand. You can't have social justice without social equality. And in a capitalistic society, if those who capitalism was built on bear the sins of people who have been enslaved here and the people who are being used as cheap labor now, if those people don't get an active role in capitalism or the opportunity to participate, then what are we left with but a permanent underclass?

I believe that part of social justice is making sure that economic justice happens.

RUHLE: I want to go with a false narrative. People who might say, well, these Black households maybe just don't have the money for a bank account. That is not true. They are not underbanked because they don't have enough money for a bank account. In the United States, we don't offer financial literacy as part of our education system. And there's not equal access.

KILLER MIKE: Absolutely.

RUHLE: Is that why you're doing this?

KILLER MIKE: Absolutely. I was fortunate to be raised by people that were born in 1922 and 1932. My grandparents raised me. My grandmother's family had been a sharecropping family that earned enough money to buy their own farm, buy their own land.

She came from a more financially secure background than my grandfather, whose dad left when he was in third grade and he was left there to essentially leave school and take care of his sisters.

I learned that financial literacy was important. We were marched into a bank as early as five, six and eight years old. Me and my sister started our first bank account. We were taught by my grandmother to balance our checkbooks. I was the worst at it. My sister, who was the best at it, is an accountant at a corporation now. I have to hire her and people like her.

But I learned very early to take care of your coin and your coin will take care of you. I was fortunate to be in a household where that happens — but that can be taught to kindergartners, third graders, sixth-seventh graders and all through high school.

And I think that that should be a part of not just home economics once you get to high school, it should be a part of our fundamental education from the time we're in kindergarten forward.

RUHLE: Me, too. I was rolling pennies on rainy days with my grandmother.

The Greenwood Initiative: Talk us through what happened in Greenwood because it is a tragic stain on American history that not enough people understand.

KILLER MIKE: There have been many tragic stains on American history in relation to the group of people called Blacks in America and this is one of them that I think is curable and fixable.

About 100 years ago, there was a community called Greenwood in Tulsa, and due to racism, bigotry, hatred and violence, it was destroyed. It was celebrated as a Black Wall Street because Blacks that had newly been freed were helping the country expand West.

They created this system in which they had their own schools, their own churches, their own doctors and dentists. They had everything any other community has to be successful. They turned a dollar 36 times in that community before that dollar left. So that dollar landed in my business to help enrich me and help me to employ people to enrich them."

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

At some point, most of us have had “drink more water” on our to-do list. But most of us also know that increasing your daily water intake is easier said than done. As we spend more time at home, keeping a pitcher full of water makes things more convenient and can encourage us to drink more throughout the day. But there are also other steps that we may take to help.

Our first plan of attack? Make it less boring. After all, you've never forgotten an iced latte or glass of lemonade at the start of work, right? By infusing water with fruit, veggies and herbs like mint and rosemary you’ll have a beverage your taste buds actually enjoy, making it more likely to sip more frequently.

The second step: Invest in some items that will make the whole thing a no-brainer, like drinking water reminder apps, smart water bottles and more. By taking advantage of a smart product designed to help you get your recommended water intake, you’ll keep your goal front of center and sip more throughout the day (instead of trying to guzzle all 64 ounces before you go to bed), without having to add yet another thing to your mental to-do list.

Here's a water bottle worth having in the cabinet. It comes with an infuser to hold sliced fruit, veggies and herbs for all-natural (and sugar-free) flavor. Suddenly the beverage known for being the most boring gets a little more interesting — and the bottle solves the issue of sucking up pulp and herbs while you sip. Plus, making your own flavored water at home is a money saver. A smarter choice for your health and your bank account.

Sometimes we’re sipping our water bottle on the go, other times we prefer a nice glass of ice water at home. Plus, don’t forget that other beverages like coffee and tea count towards your daily fluid intake. Enter Ulla. The tracker that you can place on any bottle, cup or to-go mug so that you get credit for every single sip. The tracker knows when you take a drink, and begins to blink after your cup of choice sits stagnant for 40 minutes, reminding you to take a sip. If you struggle to make drinking water throughout the day a habit, and are easily sucked into work, zoom meetings and errands, this tracker will help encourage you to hydrate regularly (without having to think about it).

Another way to keep water interesting? Make it fizzy. Unfortunately buying packs of seltzer can be pricey (not to mention a pain to lug up the stairs to your apartment). Luckily for you, SodaStream solves both of those problems by enabling you to whip up some carbonated water in your kitchen whenever the craving hits. And the fizzy beverage may indeed be effective at aiding hydration: a study conducted by the company found that that SodaStream users consume 43 percent more water than non-users. Plus, it’s lightweight and wireless — which means we’ll be bringing it out on our patio for refreshing sparkling water, or a bubbly cocktail mixer during virtual happy hour.

This isn’t your standard bottle of water. It glows to remind you to take a drink! A sensor inside the bottle measures how much water you're drinking and sends that data to a companion app that will suggest ways to improve your water drinking habits over time. The BPA-free and food safe bottle even syncs with your phone to help you find it if you've misplaced it.

Want to ditch the flavored sports drinks in plastic bottles for good? This 17-ounce smart water bottle sports an anodized aluminum shell for durability and is designed to deliver both flavor and nutrients, like electrolytes and vitamins, you need for different activities through the day. A dedicated app keeps track of your drinking habits, allowing you to set and customize hydration goals on the fly.

If you love UV sanitizing devices, this might be your next bottle. LARQ's bottlecap is equipped with UV-C LED lights that are designed to purify up to 99.99 percent of contaminates in your water. The bottle is set to self-clean every two hours and its double-walled vacuum insulation keeps drinks cold for 24 hours or hot for 12 hours.

This 32-ounce Hydro Flask features durable stainless steel and double wall vacuum insulation to keep your water cold. It's equipped with a wide mouth and features a flexible straw lid so you can easily sip throughout the day. It's also dishwasher-friendly and comes in a variety of colors, including Cobalt, Hibiscus and more.

The Life Bottle holds one gallon of water, making it fit for whole day's hydration. It comes with time measurements, from morning to evening, so you can easily asses your progress. Although it's quite bulky, you can fill it up once at the start of your day and likely don't need to worry about refilling it again.

Sometimes all it takes to implement a new habit is having it front and center — like that basket of fruit on the counter or setting your gym clothes out the night before. The same can be said for having a big jug of freshly-filtered water sitting on your counter or in your fridge, ready to pour into a glass. This “smart” pitcher is power-activated so it instantly filters a one-gallon (or 16-cup) carafe without the painful drip by drip process of your standard water pitchers. Added bonus: It removes 10 times more contaminants, including over 99 percent of lead, according to the brand. The one-gallon dispenser is perfect for the counter, while the half-gallon (8 cup) dispenser fits in the refrigerator door.

Many of us fail to have a bottle of water on hand when we need it most — when we’re outside being active on a hot day. But we get it: the last thing anyone wants to do when riding their bike, heading out on a weekend hike or spending the day at the beach is lug around a cumbersome bottle. That’s where the Vapur comes in handy. Dubbed the “anti-bottle,” it’s made of a flexible material that lays flat when it's empty. So once you drink the water, you can fold it up and store it in a pocket or bag without adding any bulk to your load. You can also opt for a detachable hose, perfect for hands-free hydrating during your run or hike.

We love turning our goals into games. We have weekly step challenges with our friends, use an app to wager money against our health goals and now we’re using our water intake to indulge our green thumb. Whenever you log a glass, the app uses it to water your virtual plant. If you can’t seem to make drinking water a habit for your own health, keeping your adorable windowsill plant alive may be just the motivation you need. Download it for free on iOS or Android.

As you and your family enjoy the last stretch of summer, sunscreen should remain top of mind. Whether you’re spending a day at the beach, having a picnic in the park or gearing up for a end-of-summer barbecue, finding which sunscreens are best for your kids can be difficult.

Of course, you want one that’s going to effectively protect them from sunburns (since research finds that five or more bad sunburns before age 20 can increase someone’s risk of melanoma by a whopping 80 percent). But you also want to make sure that what you’re putting on your child’s extra-delicate skin is completely safe.

SKIP AHEAD Best sunscreen for kids

How to find the best sunscreen for kids

Regardless of age, always choose a sunscreen that’s broad-spectrum, meaning it blocks both UVA and UVB rays, with an SPF 30 at minimum, said Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor of his site DermBoard. UVA rays prematurely age skin, while UVB rays cause sunburns; SPF refers to how much UVB light sunscreen can filter out.

Planning a fun day in the pool or a weekend trip to the beach? “If your child will be partaking in water activities, make sure to look for a formula that is water-resistant,” said Gretchen Frieling, MD, a dermatopathologist in Boston. Sunscreen can be labeled water-resistant for up to 40 or 80 minutes, so you’ll still have to reapply regularly.

As for the type of sunscreen you use on your child, dermatologists advise sticking to mineral (also known as physical) formulas, rather than chemical ones, for a variety of reasons. “I prefer zinc oxide-based products, as unlike chemicals, they block out the full UV spectrum,"" said Kenneth Mark, MD, a dermatologist and Mohs skin cancer surgeon in New York City. Plus, mineral sunscreens don’t absorb in the skin the way chemical ones do, are generally less irritating and are also better for the environment, noted Tonkovic-Capin.

While spray sunscreens are a popular choice among older kids and teens, Tonkovic-Capin prefers lotions and creams. “Sunscreens are designed to go onto your skin and not into your lungs or the lungs of other people around you when you try to spray it onto your skin,” he said. And as Sheel Desai Solomon, MD, a dermatologist in Raleigh/Durham, pointed out, “spray makes it difficult to regulate the amount you are putting on, meaning you can put on less than you need.”

How to apply sunscreen to your kids

“Kids need sunscreen and rely on adults to apply it when they are too young to apply on themselves,” said Tess Mauricio, MD, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills. Apply approximately half a teaspoon of sunscreen to your child’s face and one ounce to their entire body, and remember to reapply every two hours (or any time they get wet), added Susan Bard, MD, a dermatologist in New York City.

Raising a tween or teen? Teaching them about the importance of applying, and reapplying, sunscreen is key, said Solomon. That said, “some teens and young adults are concerned and embarrassed by the shiny residue some sunscreen products leave behind so they apply an insufficient amount of protection,” Solomon said. “If your child has these concerns, talk to them and instill in them the importance of protecting our skin.” Tonkovic-Capin suggested moving on to another brand until you find one you and your kids absolutely like to use.

Other sun safety tips for children

“The biggest misconception is that it is good enough just to use a sunscreen for adequate protection from the sun,” said Tonkovic-Capin. Other steps you should take to keep your kids sun-safe are avoiding taking them out during peak UV hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) and putting them in protective clothing, a broad-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses when they are outside, said Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. You should also always seek shade when the family is outside.

The best sunscreen for kids

To help you and your family practice a sun protection routine, we’ve gathered the best sunscreens for kids. Here are dermatologists top picks.

“This mineral blocker sunscreen contains only zinc oxide for broad-spectrum protection that can be used by anyone, even kids and those with sensitive skin,” said Joshua Zeichner, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. Neutrogena’s SheerZinc has a hypoallergenic formula and is free of fragrance and dyes, which helps to prevent irritation on your child’s sensitive skin. It’s also water-resistant up to 80 minutes.

For the child who just doesn’t want to wear sunscreen, this glitter-packed sunscreen is a game-changer. “This is a completely mineral based sunscreen and a great way to get kids excited about putting on their sunscreen,” said Bard. As a bonus, the formula is biodegradable.

This physical sunscreen is a favorite of King’s because you can throw it in your bag for easy re-application. “The powder format is so easy to apply so kids won't complain about goopy sunscreen, there's no smell and it's translucent,” she said. “And the brush is soft and brightly colored so it's fun to apply.”

Solomon cited Aveeno as one of her go-to brands when looking for a good kids’ sunscreen. This mineral sunscreen has a mild, hypoallergenic formula that won’t cause irritation or stinging, and it’s water resistant for 80 minutes.

Another brand Solomon likes is Babyganics. For the littlest of little ones, this mineral formula not only protects a baby’s delicate skin with SPF 50, but it also nourishes with a seed oil blend. It is meant to be non-allergenic and tear-free, so parents don’t have to worry about irritating their child’s sensitive skin when trying to protect them from the sun. Babyganics said this formula is also free of pesky ingredients such as PABA, phthalates, parabens, fragrances and nano-particles.

Mark likes this sunscreen for kids because it’s made with 21 percent zinc oxide and safe for babies six months and up. “It’s also free of fragrance, parabens, phthalates, dyes and irritating chemicals,” he said. This sunscreen was designed to be lightweight and specifically for the face, plus it is also water-resistant for up to 80 minutes. The liquid formula is hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic and oil-free, meaning it shouldn't cause pimples, and plays nicely under makeup — so feel free to borrow your child's sunscreen if you're wearing makeup.

Teens dealing with acne breakouts may not be too keen on applying sunscreen. Enter Proactiv's formula (which is a chemical, rather than a physical blocker), a favorite of Mauricio. “For older kids and teenagers who are starting to have issues with oily skin, clogged pores, whiteheads, blackheads and acne, this sunscreen can help add moisture, reduce shine and also protect the skin from UV damage,” she said.

Sometimes it seems like the world is conspiring against your ability to get some sleep. The birds, as lovely as they are, start chirping way too early and the landscapers and car-honkers always seem to follow suit. That construction zone down the street somehow sounds as if it were directly outside your window, that late night that went way too long, and to top it all off, news about the coronavirus can be unsettling.

While many external factors aren’t within your control, you can do a few things to help lull yourself to sleep faster and, once you're there, ensure that your sleep is the kind that will have you feeling energized the next morning. We tapped medical and sleep experts for advice on how to get more zzz’s — and the products that will help you doze off.

Guided meditation for sleep: Where to start?

You’ve heard this advice ad nauseam, but there’s a reason meditation has been prescribed to treat the human condition since roughly 1500 BCE. “The art of falling asleep is actually not trying so hard,” says Alex Dimitriu, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and sleep medicine expert. “Knowing how to clear your thoughts and focus on breathing will always help. The trick is to practice by day — not when it's mission-critical at 3 a.m.” Meditation can be as simple as sitting in a quiet space and taking meaningful, deliberate breaths or listening to your favorite music for five minutes.

For some guidance, try Headspace, an app that works on both Android and Apple devices, and walks you through mindful sessions. There's even a special category for Sleep Sounds and Meditations to try while attempting to get some shut eye. Headspace has nearly 678,000 reviews and a 4.9-star average rating on iTunes.

Techies might find solace in the highly-rated Muse 2, which is designed to sense brain activity, heart rate, breathing and movement to help guide you through meditation routines. The device pairs with your Bluetooth headphones and has a micro-USB port, offering up to five hours of power.

Eliminate allergens in the bedroom: How to pick the best air purifier

The accumulation of allergens in your bedroom can contribute to subpar sleep. “Reducing your exposure to allergens — such as dust mites, pollen and pet dander — while you sleep will reduce itchy watery eyes, eczema, nasal congestion, and coughing,” says Purvi Parikh, MD, an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network. “The bedroom is (the) most important place to keep allergen-free since we spend most time at once there.” To help, keep windows closed during peak-pollen seasons, keep pets off the bed, wash your bedding and dust and sweep once a week. Parikh adds any HEPA air purifier will help combat mold and animal dander.

When it comes to the best air purifiers, BETTER found that while this air purifier is a splurge, it can purify a room up to 700 square feet. Clifford Bassett, MD, a board-certified doctor in New York, said he likes this brand because it makes customizable filters that address odors, toxins or pet allergens. MinusA2 isn’t just quiet, the sleek design can also be mounted on a wall.

This is another option that’s been certified “asthma and allergy friendly” by the AAFA. It features a HEPA and carbon filter that traps particles as small as 0.3 microns. “The most harmful particulates are the smallest, or less than 2.5 microns in size,” says Denitza Blagev, MD, a pulmonologist at Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

And since pollen and dust mites are too small to be filtered, Parikh also recommends a dust mite cover that zips around your mattress and box spring. To help simplify your search for mattress protectors, we rounded up a few highly-rated options on Amazon.

Sporting a 4.3-star average rating from more than 3,000 reviewers on Amazon, this mattress protector prevents allergens, bed bugs, dust mites and even sweat from damaging your mattress. The machine-washable encasement comes with a 10-year warranty and has Micro-Zipper technology, which the brand says helps prevent bed bugs from sneaking through the zipper's teeth.

The American-made protector from Brooklyn Bedding offers up hypoallergenic protection against bed bugs, dust mites and bacteria along with zip-tight construction to help protect your mattress. It’s machine-washable and made from waterproof materials to help prevent liquid damage to your mattress.

Can blue light-blocking glasses help you avoid blue light?

We’re surrounded by blue light via smart phones and light bulbs, and it notably contributes to wakefulness. “Your body needs to know that it's nighttime so it can prepare for sleep. This is why, when you are camping, it's hard to stay awake,” says Amy Serin, a neuropsychologist and author of ""The Stress Switch."" “The brain uses sunlight to know when it's day or night, but unfortunately artificial light can trick your body into thinking it's daytime. It's not just your screens doing it — lamps and overhead lighting trick your brain as well.”

Camping every single night (or resisting the urge to scroll Instagram) isn’t an option for most of us, but blue-light filtering glasses can help.

In 2019, Oprah Winfrey included these $25 blue light glasses in her annual list of Oprah’s Favorite Things. PeeperSpecs says these affordable reading glasses offer 40-percent Blue Light protection along with 99% UVA and UVB light protection. These spectacles have seven layers of anti-reflective coating and a dual anti-scratch coating, which is particularly helpful if you tend to drop your glasses.

With more than a dozen color options and a 4.3-star average rating from more than 18,300 reviewers, these fashionable blue-light glasses on Amazon are worth hitting add to cart. Tijn says these light-weight spectacles offer 100-percent protection against UV rays thanks to the lenses' yellow tint. The square-shaped frames have curved edges, making the design particularly flattering to those with oval faces.

How to fall asleep faster by eliminating the drama around you

A spike in cortisol, also known as the stress hormone, can contribute to an inability to fall asleep. For that reason, it’s best to eliminate all sources of stress before going to bed. That includes highly dramatic TV shows and movies (save the ""American Horror Story"" for the afternoon), stressful text messages or conversations, and racing thoughts. “Because sleep is dependent on nervous system regulation, reducing stress and restoring someone to a state of calm can promote sleep onset, and can help someone go back to sleep if they wake up prematurely during the night,"" says Serin. ""Anything relaxing can help someone fall asleep like gentle music, aromatherapy and deep breathing, meditation, even journaling and winding down with herbal tea before bed can help.""

Dimitriu adds: ""If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get out of bed and do something boring and relaxing. A dim light and a book are ideal.”

Here are some products that fit the bill and might help you unwind before going to bed.

Nearly 49,000 reviewers have left an average 4.4-star rating for this essential oil diffuser available in four colors — White, Yellow, Brown, and White/Grey — and has seven mood light settings. Add a few drops of calming lavender essential oil to 100 ml of water to help you decompress while laying in bed. The quiet diffusers offer up to five hours of continuous use when unplugged from the included charging device.

If you want an essential oil diffuser that will disperse calming scents while you sleep, then try this option from Asakuki, which lasts up to 16 hours. You can also set a timer for 60, 120 or 180 minutes or if you prefer you can press a button to activate the built-in humidifier which helps to keep your skin moist in dry weather. The 1.5 lbs aromatherapy device has more than 11,100 reviews and has a 4.6-star average rating.

This Nightly Valerian Relaxation Tea is meant to promote a good night's sleep. It contains one box with 16 sealed tea bags and is non-GMO certified. The flavors of the tea have earthy and minty tones. Over 2,700 Amazon shoppers gave this product a 4.4-star average rating.

If you find listening to white noise is soothing or just open to trying a new remedy to help lull you to sleep, consider Marpac Dohm Connect's white noise machine. It is paired with app-enabled technology so you can power, control volume settings and set a sleep schedule all from your phone. There are two-speed options available for adjustable tone and volume so you can create a personalized sound environment.

How to stay cool in your bed while you sleep

“Your body naturally wants to cool down as you enter deep sleep, and anything you can do that increases this cooling helps with getting deeper, more restorative sleep,” says Dimitriu. This can be as simple as taking a warm shower about an hour before bed, which triggers your body to lower its internal temperature. Dimitriu is a self-proclaimed minimalist and encourages his patients ""to keep their sleep routines simple and straightforward,"" rather than relying on devices to improve sleep.

""Quite simply a comfortable bed (softer for side sleepers), and a good pillow to match can help,"" he says. ""While cooling pads and blankets are available, it might just be simplified to using a light enough blanket made of breathable fabric to facilitate good cooling and breathability."" Dimitriu also advises keeping your bedroom below 70 degrees to help your sleep.

If you are still interested in testing out cooling bedding, there is an entire range of products out there you can use to sleep more comfortably.

Over the past few years, Instant Pots have become a staple in small kitchen appliances. Busy parents use them to get dinner on the table in minutes, while batch cookers use them to simplify midweek meals. Some people prefer them for their ability to cook just about everything from pot roast to yogurt. Staying home has become the new norm to help prevent coronavirus from spreading, so you're probably using your time indoors to cook more and try out new recipes. Alongside summer cooking staples like grills, an Instant Pot is a relatively quick, easy and affordable way to whip up home-cooked meals while under quarantine. Here's everything you should know about an Instant pot, including how it works, best Instant Pots to buy and more.

“A few years ago the idea that people would be cooking in pressure cookers en masse was unthinkable,” says Elizabeth Barbone, a cookbook author and the creator of the pressure-cooker blog Cook Fast, Eat Well. “It’s been really fun to see folks not only embrace it, but to embrace it in different ways.”

Instant Pots typically range anywhere between $60 to over $100 depending on the model’s size, cooking capabilities and other design features. As you may know, tech and electronics are traditionally high-savings categories during major sale events like Black Friday and Cyber Week. Even a new sale like Amazon’s Big Summer Sale, which is currently active until Sept. 7, is slashing prices on small kitchen appliances, including Instant Pots.

WHAT ARE INSTANT POTS?

Instant Pots are a brand of electric pressure cookers or multicookers. Pressure cookers work by creating heat under a tight seal, so the temperature is much higher than the boiling point of water and the steam can’t escape. The steam cooks food much more quickly than traditional stovetop or oven cooking.

“It’s like a Crock Pot on steroids,” says Brittany Williams, founder and creator of Instant Loss and author of Instant Loss: Eat Real, Lose Weight. “You can put everything in there and walk away.”

DO THEY REALLY COOK THAT FAST?

According to Bruce Weinstein, coauthor of ""The Instant Pot Bible,"" the answer is yes. ""Under high heat and pressure, things cook much faster. You can cook a brisket or pulled pork in under an hour,"" he says. “The claims sound outlandish — it reduces cooking time by 70 percent — but that’s because of the steam and the pressure,” Barbone says.

There are a couple of caveats, though. You need to add in the time it takes the machine to come up to pressure, usually 15 or 20 minutes.

And for some dishes, you’ll want the pressure to dissipate gradually. That can take five to 40 minutes depending on the dish. “For meat-based dishes, I like to release the pressure naturally for at least 10 minutes. If you release it right away the meat can seize up and become tough,” Williams says.

ARE ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKERS SAFE?

Years ago, stovetop pressure cookers got a bad reputation for their lids being relatively easy to remove before the pressure released, which runs the risk of burns and messes. “You could end up with soup on your ceiling,” says Williams.

To avoid those issues, modern electric models are equipped with built-in safety features that prevent you from releasing the lid while the pressure is still high.

“Pressure cookers are safe, but we need to be following good practices,” Barbone says. Some of the things you might see on the Internet, like covering the steam release valve to protect cabinets or walls from steam, aren’t safe. Instead, position your pot accordingly if that’s a concern.

And don’t fill your Instant Pot more than about halfway. You need the pot empty enough to get to a safe pressure and remain safe throughout your cooking time.

WHAT FEATURES DO I NEED?

Multicookers include the pressure cooker plus other additional features. You’ll see names like 6-in-1 or 10-in-1, depending on how many of these other options they add:

High- and low-pressure

Slow cooker

Rice/porridge cooker

Cake maker

Yogurt maker

Sauté/sear feature

Steamer

Warmer

Sterilizer

Air fryer

Altitude adjuster

The sauté setting is popular. Instead of sautéing in one pan and transferring your food to another pot, you can use the Instant Pot the same way you use an electric skillet, Weinstein says.

If you want to make delicate vegetables or cream-based soups, you might want a pot with a low-pressure option. Likewise, if you’ll do canning, you want a pot with that capability. And if Bluetooth connectivity and high-end electronics are a must, you can choose more advanced models that sport those features.

The Instant Pot line includes a range of models — Lux, Duo, Viva, Ultra, Smart Wifi, and Max. With over 10 options to choose from, you’ll need to determine what features you want to know which model is the right fit for you.

Another consideration? If you plan to leave your Instant Pot out on your countertop, you might want to factor in the different colors and designs you can choose with different models.

WHAT IF I JUST WANT A PRESSURE COOKER?

“A lot of people are not interested in all those other things — they just want something that can cook their dinner,” Weinstein says.

If this sounds like you, you may want to check out this pressure cooker by Cuisinart rather than a multicooker. If you only foresee using your device for pressure cooking and aren’t interested in all the extra bells and whistles, you might even find a better price by going in that direction.

Just keep in mind when following an Instant Pot recipe, it may take a few extra minutes to cook if you're not using one of the Instant Pot multicookers, which tends to get hotter than most other pressure cookers.

WHAT SIZE DO I NEED?

The 6-quart option is well-liked because it is the size most recipes are designed for and can feed families of up to five. If you’re looking to create side dishes, or feed one to two people, the 3-quart mini may be right for you. On the other hand, if you’re cooking for large families or crowds, want to get ahead of meal prep for the week or are looking to cook large cuts of meat, you might want to consider the 8- or 10-quart options.

“With the 8-quart it’s hard to make things for one or two people, because you have to have a certain amount in there to work properly and create pressure,” Weinstein says.

The 3-quart is a good choice for smaller spaces or as a side pot for smaller dishes.

I’VE HEARD FOOD BURNS SOMETIMES. HOW CAN I AVOID THAT?

Williams says the burn sensor is more sensitive in newer, higher pressure models. The liquid ratio is key, so if you notice that there’s not enough liquid, or your sauce is too thick, you may run into burning.

“In testing recipes that has happened to me a few times,” Weinstein says. He adds, using canned tomatoes packed in juice vs. packed in puree can make a difference.

“The best way to avoid that is to follow tested recipes,” he says. “If it hasn’t been tested, you might end up with a burn.”

It’s also best to put your liquids and the foods that will release the most water on the bottom of the pot and wait until after your dish is cooked to stir everything together.

Make sure you are using a recipe designed for the size pot you have. You could run into burning if you’re using a recipe designed for a 6-quart pot in an 8-quart pot.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?

If you’re new to an Instant Pot, follow the user manual and heat water in your pot as an initial test run. Barbone recommends that you listen to the sound of a pressure cooker coming to pressure. “The steam will sort of violently come out of the valve. If you’ve never heard it before, it can be a little startling,” he says.

After that, try cooking something simple and inexpensive like rice, Williams says. Then move on to something like a broth-based soup. “Start with something simple. Don’t start with a rack of ribs for your first recipe. Do something affordable so if it doesn’t work out, you’re not ruining something that’s really pricey,” Barbone says.

HOW DO I CLEAN MY INSTANT POT?

Cleaning your instant pot is easy — You take out the liner and lid and wash with dish soap and warm water. You can also run it through the dishwasher for convenience. Some shoppers have found the sealing ring for the lid traps scents, and they like to have two on hand, one for sweet dishes and one for savory foods. To combat any lingering odors, store the lid upside down or run the pot using the steam function with a little vinegar and lemon juice.

If you scald the bottom of your pot, Williams recommends the powder version of Barkeepers Friend.

While you may have left your love for emo music behind in high school, acne isn’t always something you can say goodbye to so easily. Acne is becoming increasingly more common in adults, with up to 15 percent of women affected—and dry or oily skin can also have similar effects on your skin.

So what causes acne, exactly? “When skin pores get clogged, usually by dead skin cells, oil cannot discharge and accumulates in the pore and under the skin, creating a whitehead or blackhead,” explains Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor DermBoard.org. “This is a perfect environment for [the bacteria] Propionibacterium acnes, which then flourishes and causes inflammation, creating pimples.”

IN THIS ARTICLE Best ingredients | Best products

Alison Tam, a board-certified dermatologist in Las Vegas, says hormonal changes like perimenopause or menopause, or the use of hormones like testosterone, can cause adult acne. “Adult onset acne may also have no cause, which is extremely common, and progress from just a few pimples to full cystic acne over the course of months to years,” she says.

Best ingredients for acne-prone skin

Controlling acne can be difficult, depending on the severity of your condition, but it’s not impossible. Derms swear by a few ingredients, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and Adapalene. While they vary in their chemical compounds, each ingredient can help you achieve your acne-free skin care goals.

Salicylic acid

“Salicylic acid exfoliates the stratum corneum (outer layer of skin) and penetrates into pores to remove sebum,” says Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. This helps to prevent pores from being clogged and can help remove clogs that have already formed.""

Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid, meaning it's a chemical exfoliator.

According to King, salicylic acid is gentle enough for sensitive skin types to use.

""It dissolves the bonds that hold dull, dead skin cells on the surface of the skin so the skin will gently shed, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath,"" says King. Salicylic acid isn’t limited to your face — it’s a beneficial ingredient found in dry scalp and dandruff shampoos, too.

Benzoyl peroxide

""Benzoyl peroxide is helpful for treating acne not only because it kills bacteria that contribute to acne, but because it helps prevent and clear out clogged pores,"" explains King.

King advises looking out for micronized formulas because they cause less irritation and have a longer shelf life.

Benzoyl peroxide can bleach your clothes and towels, so it's best to use cleansers with this ingredient in the shower.

Adapalene

An OTC retinoid can help manage acne, as well, says King.

Retinoids regulate skin cell turnover to keep pores free of oil and inflammation at bay.

Adapalene is the first OTC retinoid, and it's available in 0.1-percent and 0.3-percent strength.

When shopping for skincare products for acne-prone skin, King advises that you buy non-comedogenic items because they won’t clog pores. Tam adds that you should cleanse with gentle face wash twice a day.“Harsh cleansers can strip too much oil and can have the opposite effect, over-stimulating your oil glands,” says Tam. “This may leave you feeling good right away but make you oilier over time.” Follow up cleansing with a non-comedogenic moisturizer and sunscreen (in the morning), suggests Tam.

When using an acne treatment like benzoyl peroxide or retinoid, you only need a small amount, about a pea size, for your entire face, says Nancy Samolitis, a board-certified dermatologist and co-founder and medical director of Facile Dermatology + Boutique. Because these treatments are powerful, you should limit application to once a day, Samolitis advises.

If over-the-counter products aren't working for you, consider seeing a dermatologist or your general practitioner who can help you explore other treatment options, including prescription medications. For adult women, birth control pills with low-dose estrogen and progesterone are often helpful, says Melanie Palm, MD, a dermatologist in San Diego.

Best products for acne-prone skin

Ready to take the first step in getting your acne under control? Below, top dermatologists share their favorite skin care products for acne-prone skin. Here’s to clearer skin days ahead!

“This (non-comedogenic) cleanser contains salicylic acid to clean out pores and calm acne,” says Palm. There's also glycolic acid, a popular type of Alpha Hydroxy Acid, which leads to more even-toned skin and Lipo Hydroxy Acid, which removes excess oil, leaving your skin shine-free. It's suitable for most skin types — acne-prone, oily, combination and sensitive — because it's free of oils, fragrances and parabens. Those with dry or normal skin might find this gel cleanser too dehydrating for regular use.

“This is an excellent benzoyl peroxide product,” says King. With 2.5% micronized benzoyl peroxide it’s effective yet gentle. The cleanser also contains glycerin, a hydrating ingredient. “This is a great cleanser choice if you have a combination of some clogged pore type of acne with whiteheads and blackheads and some inflammatory acne with bigger pink or red pimples,” she says.

Cleanse your face twice daily with Samolitis's pick. MicroClear technology combines 2-percent salicylic acid with oil-dissolving ingredients, unclogging pores and preventing acne-causing buildup. Neutrogena says those with mild to moderate acne will see results within 24 hours because the proprietary technology helps push the ingredients deep into pores.

This device will help you wash your face more effectively, says Palm. A timer tells you when to move on to the next area of your face. It’s also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower. Since Clarisonic is going out of business on September 30, PMD's Clean Smart Facial Cleansing Device is a similar option to consider. The brush is made of silicone, meaning it’s waterproof, antibacterial and odor-resistant. It also vibrates 7,000 times per minute to help remove oil and dirt in your skin, which helps to prevent future breakouts.

Charcoal and 2% salicylic acid pack a one-two punch against pimples, plus the gritty texture provides physical exfoliation to unclog pores. “This is an ideal cleanser choice if you have oily skin and clogged pores with whiteheads and blackheads, without many inflammatory pimples,” says King. It’s also a good alternative to benzoyl peroxide if that’s something your skin can’t tolerate well, she adds.

Emmy M. Graber, MD, a dermatologist and president of the Dermatology Institute of Boston, explains that most benzoyl peroxide products contain 10 percent of the ingredient, but higher strengths have never been proven to be better for acne. “Higher strengths only irritate the skin more, so you should look for a lower strength,” says Graber, who is a fan of this product. It contains 3.5 percent benzoyl peroxide and can be used as a daily cleanser or weekly mask to kill bacteria and prevent future breakouts.

Toning isn’t an essential skin care step, but it can help remove pore-clogging debris from your skin. Samolitis likes this toner because it’s alcohol-free, meaning it won’t strip skin of essential moisture. Lactic and citric acids remove dead skin cells, while aloe soothes.

Graber suggests this toner because witch hazel helps control oil production, relieves inflammation and shrinks the appearance of pores. The fragrance-free, all-natural formula is gentle enough for sensitive skin types, although those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin will find it beneficial as well. The brand says it doubles as a makeup remover, although you may want to avoid using it to wipe away eye makeup.

Don’t think you can skip out on moisturizer if you have acne. It’s all about finding one that’s right for your skin type. This one, a favorite of Samolitis, is formulated with niacinamide to hold moisture in and prevent excess oil production while cucumber soothes irritation. The moisturizer looks thick in the jar yet feels lightweight and soaks into skin with ease.

Sunscreen is an essential step, regardless of your skin type, the weather or you're working indoors. Palm recommends the non-comedogenic formula, which is free of heavy moisturizers that could clog pores. “Zinc oxide and niacinamide are anti-inflammatory and do not promote oil production,” she says. Elta MD's sunscreen offers broad-spectrum protection against the sun's UVA and UVB rays, which cause signs of aging and sun damage.

It might seem counterintuitive to apply oil to your face if you have acne, but this one, which Samolitis likes, is formulated specifically to treat blemishes. Blue tansy is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, minimizing redness associated with acne, while azulene soothes the skin and kukui nut oil balances sebum production. The deep blue oil is best suited for those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin over dry and normal skin types.

“This face mask contains sulfur, the oldest known ingredient to help with skin inflammation,” says Graber. The combo of sulfur and zinc oxide in this mask draw out impurities and gets rid of excess oil, while calamine and cucumber extract cool skin and ensure you don’t feel irritated afterward. Apply the mask either two or three times a week and let it dry on your face for about 15 to 20 minutes. You can also use it as a spot treatment on stubborn breakouts.

Palm says this no-rinse mask is gentle yet effective, with ingredients including lactic and glycolic acids (AHAs) that target pimples and heal post-inflammatory pigmentation and redness. Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital, previously told NBC News Shopping that this face mask also contains ""soy and kiwi complex to exfoliate and brighten the skin.""

Formulated with 0.1 percent retinaldehyde (a non-prescription retinoid) and soothing thermal spring water, Samolitis likes this treatment lotion that targets acne without irritating. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) Enzyme buffs away dirt and oil to help decongest pores and prevent breakouts. After you cleanse and tone your skin at night, then you can rub the lotion into your skin.

Samolitis and King recommend this OTC retinoid, which promotes skin cell turnover and curbs inflammation to deep clean pores and prevent new pimples from forming. After you cleanse, tone and moisturize, apply a thin layer of the gel treatment to the affected areas of the skin.

Last week, a half a bag of grapes, a container of homemade soup and a few rogue radishes I found buried at the bottom of the produce drawer all ended up in my garbage. It pains me to see produce tied up in a garbage bag for multiple reasons:

I’m well aware of how many people don’t have easy access to the fresh produce I conveniently pick up on my walk home from work.

I could have used those ingredients to create healthy meals.

I see dollar signs going right into the garbage can along with my wilting kale and mushy zucchini.

I’m not alone: In the United States, 31 percent of the available food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten. And those of us who eat a healthy eating diet are some of the biggest culprits: A study published in the journal Plos One found that the healthiest Americans are the most wasteful, because of their high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are frequently thrown out.

While there are many factors that affect food waste, one that we have direct control over is how much we are throwing away in our own households. And I, for one, know that the organization of my fridge (or, the lack thereof) is largely to blame for my own waste. I bring home my grocery store haul and shove everything into drawers and stack them on shelves, without much rhyme or reason. And without fail on a weekly basis there is a slimy bag of greens or a half-eaten jar of tomato sauce with questionable coloring that was shoved into the back and forgotten and has to be tossed.

Certainly taking the time to put a better system in place could make a huge difference, but if my closets are any indication, my home organization skills are wanting. So I called in reinforcements.

Gilat Tunit, founder of Project Neat, a professional home organization company, says that establishing an organization system in your refrigerator is as simple as investing in a few affordable products that will make your fridge more efficient by maximizing space.

The goal is to “contain items, categorize them and separate them,” says Tunit. “It’s really important in a fridge to be able to access things. What happens to most when [storing food is] you have to move one thing out of the way to get to the other things. How many times do you open your fridge and have to pull out the entire fridge just to reach the dressing all the way in the back? We are all guilty of that process, but it’s not our fault! The options that the fridge comes with is the issue in itself. It’s basically open shelving and no real direction as to what should go where.”

“[The fridge] is the last place one imagines a possibility for organization. We assume that our fridge will just always be messy because it’s used on such a consistent basis.” says Tunit. “[People] also don’t realize how inexpensive it can be to make it organized and much more functional. A lot of times the products we can use to keep a fridge organized are the same as what we would use in a different part of our home.”

Since you’re probably spending more time at home these days, dedicate a few hours to reorganizing your refrigerator with products like mason jars, storage bins and stackable containers. Follow these expert tips from Tunit, who also shares her affordable product picks that can help optimize your fridge space — and make it easier to stock up on healthy ingredients (without any of them ending up in the trash).

What to store in it: Butter, sour cream, cream cheese, syrup, cottage cheese

Tunit calls this product a must have in every home. ""The use of products such as a lazy Susan gives you the ability to actually see everything that you have,” she says. “I suggest this for everything and anything: whether it’s your fridge or your pantry or your makeup or kid’s crayons. In my fridge I use it for condiments. There’s no rummaging, no moving things out of the way, you spin it and grab whatever you need. People think if they have a lot of stuff, they can’t organize it, but that’s not true. As long as you contain it and have everything categorized, you can have as much stuff as you want and it will still be organized.”

What to store: Fruit (strawberries, grapes, blueberries, raspberries)

“I love mason jars for fruit such as strawberries, blueberries and grapes,"" says Tunit. ""First of all , they are tall and narrow which doesn’t take shelf space. They also seal tight for lasting freshness and they are glass, which is preferable to plastic.”

What to store: Produce like peppers, yellow squash, tomatoes, small cucumbers

“There are a couple of things I love about these bins: They’re clear so you can see through them; They’re wide, which is great because you can fit a lot of stuff in there; And you’re freeing up the [produce drawer],""says Tunit. ""They have handles so it's super easy to take them in and out.""

What to store: Greek Yogurt

“This is another way to take things off of your shelves,"" says Tunit. ""It’s super easy to install — it’s literally just two little sticky tabs, take them off, and place it wherever you want in your fridge. Then you take your Greek yogurt and slide it in and it hangs — which is genius — completely off your shelving space, which frees it up.”

What to store: Grab-and-go snack foods like string cheese, fruit cups, pudding, apples (slice and separate into Ziploc baggies)

“People mostly use these for dressers and random drawers in their home, but I love it for a fridge,” says Tunit, who recommends placing them inside your produce drawer. “What you’re doing is creating separation inside of an otherwise open drawer. When it's open and you start throwing things in, you’re going to have everything mixed together. I like when everything is separated and categorized; it makes your life much easier.” She suggests using this as a snack drawer, which is especially great for people with kids. “When a child goes in and wants to pack up a lunch bag in the morning, this is an awesome way to do it.”

What to store: Deli meats; cheese

“What the pullout bin does is give you extra drawer space that you wouldn’t otherwise have,” says Tunit. “They are easy to clip on and off and you can get however many you think will fit. What I love about them is that they don’t take up actual shelf space; they hang. So you’re creating extra space without taking away any space.”

What to store: To-go avocado packs, hummus, dressing packets, veggie dip

Tunit suggests using stackable bins because “they’re narrow, not bulky, which is a space saver. They also have lids, so you’re able to stack them. You can go three, four, however many levels up you want to go based on the size of your fridge."" While she loves to use them for snack-sized containers, they are also another great way to store deli meats and cheese.

Storage ideas using products around your house

These storage ideas don’t require buying special products. Instead re-purpose things you likely already have lying around your house:

Egg carton: “This costs zero dollars, other than the eggs that come with it,” says Tunit. Once you've eaten all your eggs, simply cut off the lid of the carton and place it in the door of your fridge. ""Take condiments that are more narrow on top and flip them upside down,"" says Tunit, who adds that this is also a great trick to prevent those last drops from getting stuck at the bottom of your ketchup or salad dressing bottle.

Ziploc baggies: ""I love using freezer bags in the actual fridge for lots of things,"" says Tunit. ""For one, it’s the easiest thing to store marinated meats in. People often use a bowl, but that’s less efficient and also forces you to use a lot more sauces. I also love transferring produce, fruits, cheeses, etc. to bags because I feel they stay fresher longer as well as keeping everything separated."" She recommends labeling each bag to make the storage trick even more efficient.

""I think using an pen/pencil holder is also awesome for things such as string cheese, yogurt sticks, etc.”

Try these crispy air fried herbed chickpeas,"In my opinion, “crispy chickpeas” never lived up to their promise, and were a constant disappointment when I made them whether they were deep-fried or roasted in the oven. They often came out too soggy and chewy, rather than truly crispy. So I set out to see if the air fryer did a better job. And I can confidently say, it does the best job I’ve ever witnessed of making actually crisp chickpeas. The high heat, circulating at a super-fast speed, dries out the chickpeas so they’re almost dehydrated. Be careful, or you’ll start eating these and wake up 5 minutes later to an empty bowl.

1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and dried with paper towels

1 tablespoon olive oil

½ teaspoon dried rosemary

½ teaspoon dried parsley

½ teaspoon dried chives

¼ teaspoon mustard powder

¼ teaspoon sweet paprika

¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the kosher salt and black pepper and toss until the chickpeas are evenly coated in the herbs and spices. Scrape the chickpeas and seasonings into the air fryer and cook at 350°F until browned and crisp, 6 to 12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. Transfer the crispy chickpeas to a bowl, sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper, and serve warm.

Note: During testing, I found that different brands of canned chickpeas “fry” up at wildly different rates. Some brands only took 6 minutes to get crisp, while other brands, where the chickpeas were comparatively larger in size and meatier, took almost double that. Hence, the range in cooking time for this recipe. Start out with your favorite go-to brand and cook them for 6 minutes. If they’re not crisp enough after that, continue cooking in 2-minute intervals until they are. Then you’ll know the correct amount of time for that specific brand.

170,2020-07-02 20:05:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/8-chefs-share-their-favorite-burger-recipes-summer-ncna1009186,8 chefs share their favorite burger recipes for summer,"With summer and warm weather comes an appetite for grilled food — especially burgers. Sure, you can eat burgers year-round, but there’s nothing quite like a juicy patty hot off the grill, especially if you can enjoy it in your own backyard. Plus, when you’re flipping burgers at home, you’re in control. You get to pick the best ingredients and create different combinations to suit your palate or just what you happen to be craving. And the options are just about limitless. In addition to the classic American beef and cheese on a bun combo, you can make burgers with different meat, poultry, or seafood, sandwich them between all kinds of bread and rolls, and go crazy with toppings.

To kick off a summer we hope is filled with burgers and backyard time, we’ve gathered recipes and advice from chefs and food experts, including Andrew Zimmern, Giada De Laurentiis, Adam Richman, Serena Wolf, Martha Stewart and Jamie Purviance. From beef to salmon to turkey and from classic to creative, these pros have you covered, so fire up those coals and get ready for some serious burger bliss.

Banh Mi Burger Evan Sung

As the star of ""Man vs. Food"" and ""Adam Richman’s The Best Sandwich in America"" on Discovery, Adam Richman knows a thing or two about sandwiches and travel-inspired eating. This pork burger, adapted from his cookbook, ""Straight Up Tasty; Meals, Memories and Mouthfuls from My Travels,"" blends two of Richman’s favorites, the classic American burger and the Vietnamese banh mi. The result showcases “their best attributes” and is “creamy, crunchy, sour and juicy,” says Richman. Pork pâté is easy to find in upscale supermarkets or online, but if you can’t find it — or just don’t like it — Richman insists this burger has so much big flavor, you can skip it.

Giadzy

“Nothing says summer like ripe tomatoes in a caprese salad or a burger right off the grill, so why not have the best of both worlds?” asks TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada DeLaurentiis. Adding pesto—homemade or store-bought—and Parmesan to ground sirloin beef makes for juicy, flavor-packed burgers that get an extra boost from a bright and couldn’t-be-easier-to-make pesto mayonnaise, plus fresh tomato slices and creamy mozzarella. Serving the patties on lightly grilled focaccia emphasizes the Italian theme, but regular hamburger buns also work. You really can’t go wrong. As DeLaurentiis says, “These burgers are always a crowd pleaser.”

Grilled Turkey Kofta Burgers With Harissa Yogurt Sauce Serena Wolf / Serena Wolf

“Turkey burgers get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless,” explains Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet: Clean(ish) Food for People Who Like to Eat Dirty"" and the upcoming “The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners. But, as a fan of turkey burgers, Wolf has several tricks up her sleeve. “I always recommend using 93% lean ground turkey,” says Wolf. “That little bit of extra fat goes a long way.” It’s also helps to flavor turkey burgers more generously than traditional beef versions, adds Wolf, who uses onion, garlic, fresh parsley and mint, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cayenne pepper to bump up these Middle Eastern-inspired patties. A little crumbled feta adds additional flavor AND a little fat to keep the burgers “extra juicy and tender.”

Shrimp and Cod Burgers Martha Stewart

“Sweet shrimp and fish ground together form a uniquely rich, juicy burger,” says cooking and entertaining expert Martha Stewart. “This recipe blends the perfect amount of scallion, parsley and lemon juice to hone and polish this burger’s seafood flavor.” Be sure to plan ahead so there’s time for the patties to chill in the fridge before you grill them—they can even be made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight. The Tarragon Tartar Sauce is optional but makes a great condiment and takes minutes to whip up.

Green Chile Turkey Burgers Bryan Gardner

Like turkey burgers, chicken burgers benefit from a little extra seasoning. Stewart’s solution is to add canned green chiles and fresh cilantro, which give these lean burgers “tons of flavor.” Tomato slices are a burger standard, but Stewart steps up the game by grilling them until charred. And in lieu of cheese, she opts for a different kind of dairy: “I love the sour cream that adds a little extra creaminess at the end.”

Mexican Pork Burgers with Tomatillo-Avocado Salsa Madeleine Hill

TV personality, chef and restaurateur Andrew Zimmern prefers to put a South of the Border spin on his pork burgers. “In this recipe, I infuse ground pork with bold Mexican flavors to create an irresistible burger,” he explains. “For the best results, it’s essential that you allow the pork to sit overnight with all of the seasonings to develop complex flavor.” Those seasonings include onion, garlic, and jalapenos, plus oregano, chile powder, cilantro, and chipotle chiles in adobo. Zimmern’s burger is topped with a quick tomatillo-avocado salsa that’s the perfect complement to the rich patty, plus a thin slice of tomato and melty cheddar cheese.

Salmon Burgers with Roasted Tomatoes and Avocado Madeleine Hill

Unlike his heavily seasoned pork burgers, when it comes to salmon burgers, Zimmern takes a less is more approach. “This simple recipe allows the flavor of the salmon to shine,” he explains. With fewer ingredients, quality is extra important. “I prefer to use fresh salmon, as opposed to canned salmon,” says Zimmern. “The extra effort and cost is worth it for a better tasting burger with a superior texture.” On top, Zimmern adds oven-roasted tomatoes, which he recommends keeping on hand, especially during the summer tomato season—plus avocado slices and greens dressed with a squeeze of lemon. “For a healthier alternative, you can skip the bun and serve the salmon patty on top of a salad.”

Classic American Cheeseburger Ray Kachatorian

If you ever doubted the deliciousness of a classic burger, think again. “These cheeseburgers are exceedingly rich and gratifying,” says grilling expert Jamie Purviance. “The tender meat produces beefy juices that run down your chin, and the flavor of the charred surfaces is enough to stun you into silence.” Purviance, who included this recipe in his latest cookbook, ""Weber’s Ultimate Grilling: A Step-by-Step Guide to Barbecue Genius,"" recommends seeking out ground meat that’s from a particular cut of beef, such as chuck or roast, and 20 percent fat. When it comes to shaping the patties, aim to create loose, round balls then gently flatten them until about 1-inch thick, says Purviance. If you press a little dimple into the center of each patty, that will keep the burgers from puffing up in the center, so you have a flatter surface for all your favorite toppings.

A long winter and spring stuck inside in the dry air may have made the skin on your feet, especially your heels, super dry — dry enough to crack like a fault line. And while COVID-related self-isolation may tempt you to keep your feet hidden, cracks in your heels can fracture into deep cuts, or fissures, that can be pretty painful and even get infected. We asked board certified dermatologists Sheel Desai Solomon, MD, founder of Preston Dermatology & Skin Surgery in North Carolina and Samer Jaber, MD, founder of Washington Square Dermatology in New York City, what causes dry, cracked heels and the best treatment for dry heels.

IN THIS ARTICLE What causes dry, cracked heels | How to care for dry, cracked heels | Treating dry or cracked heels | What if over-the-counter treatments don't work?

What causes dry, cracked heels

“Cracked heels occur when you have a disruption of your skin barrier,” explains Jaber. “It can be from a medical condition, like psoriasis or eczema, or can occur when your skin is very dry.”

Other variables that can dry skin on heels enough to crack are age (your skin gets thinner, less elastic and some common medications can contribute) and, of course, winter can be quite the culprit. “Heels are at their worst in winter,” says Solomon. “Indoors and outdoors there is less humidity in the air, and a lack of humidity causes the skin to become drier. Drier skin means more cracking and peeling.” This kind of cracking can cause wounds that can easily get infected if not treated, and if you happen to have a compromised immune system or diabetes, an infection can become a serious health risk, Solomon says.

How to care for dry, cracked heels

1. Keep your feet clean and moisturized

Solomon says diligence in keeping your feet clean and moisturized will keep you on the good foot. “Wash feet with non-foaming hydrating cleanser (typically in a cream or milk form) to keep foot skin from drying further and moisturize still-damp feet after every bath or shower,” she recommends. “That's when it’s time to apply products with petrolatum, glycerin, shea butter, vitamin E or jojoba. These ingredients are very effective at preventing moisture loss.” She also recommends a kitchen cabinet remedy to try — honey. “Honey is full of antimicrobial and antibacterial properties great for cleansing and healing wounds, particularly Manuka honey,” she says, saying you can create your own honey foot mask by combining it with a drop of almond oil and slathering it on your heels.

2. Slough off dead skin

To prevent cracks, exfoliation is key. Both experts extol the virtues of moisturizers with exfoliants like urea (not urine, but a similar compound that has been shown to help moisture seep into skin), and salicylic acid, to help prevent heel cracks with regular use. Solomon also recommends using a “safe foot file that doesn’t look like a cheese grater” to remove dead skin. “Using a foot file on your feet after a shower or bath can be a great way to avoid thick calluses or cracks,” she says. “However, if the file has sharp teeth, it is putting you at risk for cuts or scrapes. The goal is to remove the old, dead skin but leave the healthy layer intact to protect [against] infection.”

3. Seal up deep cracks

Cracked heels that have reached the point where they’ve started to bleed can be extremely painful, warns Solomon. Both experts say liquid bandages are an extremely effective way of sealing up cracks to ease the pain of walking on torn skin while keeping the wounds clean.

4. Wear socks made of natural materials

The damp, dark environment of wet socks in shoes and boots can bring on a fungal foot infection that resembles dry skin, warns Solomon. To prevent this from happening, she advises choosing winter socks made from natural materials, such as cotton or wool rather than synthetic blends, to keep your feet sweat and bacteria-free. “Materials like cotton and wool are naturally more absorbent and these moisture-wicking qualities are extremely important during the winter months. An added bonus is that your feet are less likely to smell, too,” she says. Jaber says his trick to beat cracks in severe dry and cold weather is to advise his patients to apply Vaseline onto the heels of their feet before bed and immediately put on white cotton socks to lock in the moisturizer while they sleep.

Treating dry or cracked heels

Jaber recommends applying this spot treatment to your heels because its formula contains a high percentage of urea and exfoliating alpha hydroxy acid, which are great at removing dead skin cells so the moisturizing components of the formula, like sunflower oil rich in vitamins A and E, can seep in to heal skin.

Dermatologists love this non-comedogenic, lanolin-free formula, because it doesn’t irritate the skin. As it’s almost half petrolatum (qualifying it as an ointment), is enriched with ceramides (to restore your skin’s barrier) and it also contains hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that helps skin retain moisture.

Jabar favors this multitasking moisturizer for its bounty of skin-loving ingredients. Lactic, salicylic and hyaluronic acids exfoliate and moisturize; niacinamide, a B vitamin, helps prevent moisture loss; and ceramides 1, 3, and 6-II help restore your skin’s protective barrier. The formula is free of fragrances and dyes and it releases over time to keep your skin super soft.

Solomon recommends these socks because they have a liner that uses aloe vera, vitamin E, and shea butter to intensely hydrate your skin, she says. Plus, they are infused with medical-grade mineral oil for an added boost of moisture.

What if over-the-counter treatments don't work?

Both dermatologists say that if the cracks keep up despite proper, frequent application of high-quality over-the-counter products like these, it might be time to have your dermatologist take a peek. “Lack of vitamins, minerals and zinc in your diet can adversely affect your heel health,” Solomon says. “Sometimes there can be a fungus. If it’s just dry skin, dermatologists can prescribe emollients, such as ammonium lactate or urea cream, to get your skin healthy, then switch to a lotion for maintaining that health.”

But the most important thing is to try and determine the cause of the cracking, says Jaber. “If it’s more related to dryness, try and avoid harsh soaps and detergents and maybe, if it’s really dry, get a humidifier. It’s always better to prevent something than to treat it.”

You wake up before your alarm goes off. Your morning jog feels like playtime. The coffee tastes better. And there is no traffic on your way into the office. And when you sit down to get to work, you feel like you could conquer the world.

Other days are not like that all.

And while you can’t prevent every unfortunate a.m. situation that might come your way, experts say there are a few things you can do to encourage your mornings in that direction so you can make the most out of the rest of your day, too.

“If you wake up [energized], you’re going to carry that energy through the rest of the day,” says productivity expert and coach Ellen Goodwin. Starting your morning with little “wins” (having an outfit picked out and ready to go, working out and leaving on time) primes your brain to work toward more “wins” and successes throughout the day, Goodwin explains.

But if you start the morning off on the wrong foot, you’re already behind, she says. And that means you’ll need to use the energy you do have to get to a better emotional state, she explains. (Think back to how you calmed yourself down the last time you got caught in a traffic nightmare or public transport breakdown.)

“Energy equals willpower — and you only have so much at a given time,” she says. So the more of it you use to recover from a train delay or an alarm-didn’t-go-off morning, the less you have later for concentrating on a big project at work, family drama or whatever your day throws your way.

There are also physiological reasons you’re doing your body (and the rest of your day) a favor when your morning right. The body’s natural body clock — your circadian rhythm — runs on a roughly 24-hour cycle with the help of cues from your environment (like lightness and darkness and exercise) to help regulate sleep, energy levels, metabolism and other bodily functions. And the choices you make to start your day, from logging that early-bird workout to sleeping in for too long, either help or hurt keep that clock running on time, Namni Goel, PhD, a research associate professor in psychiatry in University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine says.

“The morning is a critical time that can set the tone for the entire day” — and your short- and long-term health, says Goel — a biological psychologist and behavioral neuroscientist who specializes in sleep, circadian rhythms and their effect on human physiology.

Here’s what Goodwin and Goel say are some of the best things you can do to start your day right.

1. Plan ahead!

One of the most productive things you can do to start your day on the right foot should actually happen before you go to sleep the previous day, Goodwin says — make a plan. It doesn’t need to be a minute-by-minute itinerary, but it should map out the major tasks or things you want to accomplish the next day — and how you want to spend the first few hours of the day.

Lay out the clothes you’ll wear and make sure you have ingredients ready to make a healthy breakfast. It helps to plan the small things that might slow you down, she adds. The idea is to avoid “decision fatigue,” she says. “Habits that get you out the door in the morning without having to stress over decisions enables you to have more willpower to make [other] decisions during the day about important things.”

2. Resist the snooze

Giving yourself a few extra minutes of slumber may seem like listening to your body, but in the long run you’re probably doing more harm than good. That’s because those 10 extra minutes of shuteye tend to be low-quality, light sleep since it’s not long enough for your body to make it through another sleep cycle (which tends to take around 90 minutes).

Having trouble tuning worries out and turning your brain off? Try journaling or coloring. Both activities have the same effect as meditation.

And turning in at night and waking up in the morning at the same time everyday is one of the big ways you help keep your circadian rhythm running smoothly, Goel explains. Since our circadian rhythms play such a big role in regulating energy levels and metabolism, keeping your sleep schedule regulated is one of the most key things you can do to feel energized and ready to wake up morning after morning, she says.

3. Drink water

Add lemon, ice or cucumber — or just drink it straight up. We get dehydrated overnight (especially if nature calls and you’re using the bathroom in the pre-dawn hours), Goel says. A glass or two of H2O first thing helps replenish your body’s hydration stores. It also starts your metabolism on the right foot (since the body relies on water to keep all your digestive processes running smoothly).

4. Meditate

“Quieting the brain is a time-honored way to be more creative, more contemplative and more in touch with oneself,” Goodwin says. Some people might not necessarily feel an energy boost from meditating, but because it helps us to think more effectively and efficiently, it should make for a much more productive day.

RELATED: 7 Ways to Actually Get to Bed an Hour Earlier

Having trouble tuning worries out and turning your brain off? Try journaling or coloring, Goodwin suggests. Both activities have the same effect as meditation, she says — to calm you down, slow down and focus your thinking and let inspire you to think more creatively.

5. Exercise

Muster the energy to start sweating first thing and it will reward you. Exercise releases endorphins — chemicals produced in the brain that help minimize pain and discomfort and increase wellbeing (essentially the body’s own painkillers). Read: that early jog or spin class is giving your brain a natural high and an energy boost.

Plus, endorphins can reduce stress hormones, too — helping you start your day unfettered and in control.

6. Get outside in the sun

Want to make that early workout work even harder for you? Do it outside in the sun. Getting sunlight first thing in the morning tells your body clock it’s time to start the day, Goel explains.

There’s an entire field of research (chronobiology) that shows light is what triggers the body to stop producing melatonin, the hormone that tells the body to sleep, and be more alert. (And conversely, experts know that not being exposed to enough natural light throughout the day can trigger mood problems like depression and low energy.)

Studies show that using specifically timed bright light therapy (with an artificial bright light) can yield some of the same benefits for your body clock as the sun does, if getting natural light is not an option — particularly for people with mood disorders, circadian rhythm disorders or jet lag. Though it’s worth noting that not all artificial light has the same effect, so ask a doctor to find a safe and effective treatment before you try it.

7. Make coffee (at home)

If a cup of java — or tea — starts your morning on the right foot, have your caffeine in the morning, Goel says. There’s a lot of data to show it really does help most people feel more alert and less groggy, she says. And while a coffee habit can get a bad rap, there’s also a lot of research that shows drinking it (in moderation!) actually has some health benefits, too.

Plus if you brew it at home you’re saving yourself some green, too. Spending even just a couple of dollars five days a week on coffee can set you back more than $500 over the course of a year (or as much as $1,300 for a daily five-dollar latte).

8. Eat breakfast

Food is where your body gets energy — so it makes sense that starting your day with food is one of the most energizing things you can do. Our metabolism works better earlier in the day, Goel explains. That means that the body is better able to turn the calories you eat into energy that you can use in the morning, she says. (Recent research from her team backs this up, showing that eating bigger meals later in the day was linked to more weight gain and higher cholesterol — and actually harmed the way the body breaks down fat.)

And even though there’s some discrepancy in the data, most experts agree skipping your first meal can make you more likely to overeat later in the day, Goel adds.

She suggests eating within about two hours of waking up. “You want to be able to capitalize on those energy stores before you head out the door.” And include some protein, as well healthy carbohydrates (like fruit or whole grains) in you’re a.m.-meal, she adds — and skip the donuts and other sugar-packed foods. “A donut is not going to sustain you as well as eggs,” she says.

9. Spend time with your family and friends

Set up a run date with a friend. Take the time to eat breakfast with your family. Call someone who makes you smile while you’re getting ready or walking to the office. Being with people you like and love can serve up a big boost to our mood and energy levels, Goodwin says. (Just keep in mind that stressful interactions with family and friends do the opposite — and can curtail productivity and your mood quickly, Goodwin adds.)

Next, implement some mindfulness techniques to clear your mind. This can be in the form of meditation, prayer or affirmations of gratitude.

“I recommend that all my patients engage in some sort of meditation or prayer first thing in the morning,” says Dr. Nicole Bernard Washington, a board certified psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at Elocin Psychiatric Services. “The benefit is to clear your thoughts and allow you to start the day with a clear mind.”

“Gratitude affirmations are a great way to start the day as well,” Washington says. “By starting the day making gratitude statements you allow yourself to focus on the positive things in your life. In a world that tends to highlight the negative, starting your day off on a positive note can have positive effects on your mood.”

You can also incorporate breathing exercises to help achieve clarity.

“While laying in bed, breath in through your nose, hold it for five seconds and then release the air through your mouth,” instructs Dr. Erlanger ‘Earl’ Turner, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Houston-Downtown. “Repeat these steps several times. It should help to relax the mind and body.”

Spend five minutes journaling, which can also be done in bed

The urge to pick up your phone or laptop is probably powerful now, but hold off for just another five minutes and instead take to pen and paper (ideally you should keep a journal on your nightstand).

Christie Tcharkhoutian, M.A., MFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist finds “writing upon waking” to be beneficial.

Writing continues that creative flow from your dream life into your day as opposed to automatically waking up and looking at your phone, which can put a creative block and interfere with your ability to stay present.

“Some brain research suggests that this practice is helpful for brain integration because it helps to integrate parts of the brain that involve linguistic and creative capabilities, setting a tone of creativity and balance for the rest of the day,” she says. “Writing something positive — such as three things you are grateful for or a positive intention for the day — can help to improve mood throughout the day. Our dream life and subconscious work overtime in our sleep and channeling that stream of consciousness as soon as you wake up into writing helps to feel more connected and mindful throughout your day. Writing continues that creative flow from your dream life into your day as opposed to automatically waking up and looking at your phone, reading and consuming information which can put a creative block and interfere with your ability to stay present throughout the day.”

If journaling isn’t your thing, listen to positive messages you recorded

Journaling may be a practice you’re not into, or prefer to do at night. If either is the case, consider making a recording of yourself reading daily affirmations aloud and listen to them instead.

“To implement daily affirmations into your morning and set an intention by reading them aloud to yourself, or listening to a recording of yourself reading them every morning,” says Tcharkhoutian. “If positive statements about your identity are replaying like a broken record, they will combat the negative beliefs that can creep in and sabotage your day.”

Spend 5 minutes writing down the essential tasks for the day

Once you do the aforementioned practices, you can get down to the business of the day — but before your mind starts buzzing with to-dos, use these five minutes to itemize, prioritize and be super specific with what you want to achieve today in list form.

“Don’t just [write] ‘check emails.’ Write down, ‘check 20 emails in 30 minutes from x to x time,” says Stephanie Lincoln, a licensed mental health counselor, certified fitness trainer and the Founder/CEO of Fire Team Whiskey. “We all have hundreds of items on our to-do lists, and this helps us prioritize just five essentials for that day to not feel so overwhelmed.”"

In fact, recent reports project that by the year 2039, half of all adults in the United States will be obese.

And this is certainly the time of year when even those of us who normally work out regularly find it hard to squeeze in fitness (and keep the pounds off). Over the holidays people say they’re much more likely to behave in more sedentary ways like watching TV, sleeping, eating and drinking to manage their stress. And, according to a poll by the American Psychological Association, up to 69 percent of people are stressed by the feeling of having a “lack of time” to get everything done during the holiday season.

If you’re one of those people who feels their blood pressure rise just looking at your to-do list, you may have already decided to shelve any health goals until the new year. But it is possible to begin making positive health changes — and get a jump-start on those resolutions — without having to scrounge for extra time in your schedule.

With so much going on this month, now’s not the time to make sweeping changes to your health routine. But by making some small adjustments you can still feel healthier, which helps to encourage you to make other healthy choices along the way. Plus you’re be working to offset the holiday cheer that is to blame for seasonal weight gain. Whether the holidays leave you pressed for time, or you’re just looking for ways to kick your workout routine up a notch, we’ve got you covered with simple health hacks that only take a minute or less.

Change the grip on your weights to better tone arms

According to the American Council on Exercise, people should consider varying their exercise routines not only to prevent boredom, but also to avoid reaching a plateau in performance and results. If you’ve tried on a holiday dress and noticed your arms are less toned than you’d like, a simple change in grip on your dumbbells can tweak the major muscles involved in each move and expedite your results. For example, if you’re used to doing a bicep curl with your palms holding onto the weights, with the weights parallel to the floor, you can change it up with this quick hack: Turn the dumbbells so that the head of the dumbbell is facing up, so as you curl up, you’ll be practically hitting your shoulder with the head of the weight (and performing a hammer curl). In other words, by holding onto the dumbbells and turning your wrists towards each other (instead of facing up towards the ceiling) you’ll change the angle of the bicep curl and engage different muscles.

This can be done for side extensions, overhead presses, and more arm exercises. For side extensions, simply turn the palms face up instead of face down while holding the dumbbells, and you’ll get a completely different arm workout!

Reverse the order of your workout moves

The scenario is a common one: When you first started your workout routine you saw results that you were happy with. But now, after a few weeks or months, you’re not seeing results even though you’re performing the same moves. Reverse engineering to the rescue! This tactic is another way to avoid plateauing and keep your body guessing without having to develop a whole new training routine.

Simply do your same workout routine backwards. For example, let’s take a mini workout. If you’re used to doing squats, bicep curls, then push-ups, reverse the order! Start with push-ups, then bicep curls, and then end with squats. By making your body guess which moves are coming next, you’re incorporating more interval training and helping to build more muscle.

Squat it out while you’re waiting for your shower to warm up

Instead of standing around for 60 seconds waiting for the water to get warm before you step into the shower, do squats! Even though standing does burn more calories than sitting, strength training and exercise burns even more. And your opportunities to squeeze in one minute of exercise doesn’t stop at the shower —waiting for water to boil on the stove, folding laundry or peeling vegetables all provide the perfect opportunity to drop into a squat, do some leg lifts or even a one-minute plank. Over the course of the day those bursts of activity can add up to a solid workout.

Turn your post-workout stretch into a 60-second meditation

Stress is at an all-time high over the holidays, when busy schedules, end-of-year work deadlines, family dynamics and financial concerns take a toll on our mental health. And meditation is proven to help reduce those sky-high stress levels — and the health risks that come with them. Whether you’re a meditation skeptic or feel like you don’t have the time, turn your post-workout stretch routine into a meditation by simply focusing on your breathing while stretching. Close your eyes during your stretches. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, slowing down your heart rate and focusing on how your body feels in this calming state.

And an added bonus? Research has shown that people who practice mindfulness experienced significant weight loss. So if that’s one of your fitness goals, becoming more mindful through meditating during your post-workout stretches may help you attain it faster.

Skip gym breaks and add in cardio bursts

Studies show that doing cardio in short, 60-second bursts helps improve cardiovascular fitness and can help in burning fat.

Do you give your body a rest after a set, check your phone or walk over to the water fountain? Instead, add in a one-minute burst of cardio between each weightlifting exercise, whether it be jogging in place, high knees or jumping rope. Studies show that doing cardio in short, 60-second bursts helps improve cardiovascular fitness and can help in burning fat. Plus, you’re squeezing cardio into your existing routine, without having to schedule in extra time at the gym.

Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning

This may just be the easiest change you can make to your daily routine. Of course you should be hydrating before and after a workout, but add an extra glass to your morning routine as well. By simply grabbing a glass of water first thing in morning, you’ll be adding 8-12 ounces to your tally right off the bat and you’ll be starting your day on a healthy note, which can have a ripple effect, prompting a series of healthy choices to follow. Not to mention that research shows that staying hydrated helps with fat and weight loss, and overall health.

According to the Natural Hydration Council, ""dehydration can reduce our ability to concentrate, our cognitive and physical performance, and increase feelings of aggression or irritation"" (which is already at an all-time high thanks to traffic jams, mile-long lines at the mall and having to spend extra quality time with your in-laws). And even mild dehydration can affect our mood and energy levels. So if nothing else, staying hydrated can help keep you energized and calm as you power through your holiday to-do list.

176,2018-10-24 15:46:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/running-empty-try-daily-routine-boost-your-energy-ncna922816,Running on empty? Try this daily routine to boost your energy,"American work culture is guilty of driving us to work longer and harder, leaving our energy levels at a lull. In fact, according to a 2015 survey from YouGov, 54 percent of Americans sleep only 6 hours per night and still wake up tired on 4 or more days per week, and 27 percent of Americans manage to get a full 7 to 8 hours a night and still report feeling tired or fatigued four or more days a week.

Why are we so fatigued, even if we’re getting sleep? It’s likely because fatigue and sleepiness aren’t the same thing, says Dr. Matthew Ebben, Ph.D., associate professor of Psychology and Clinical Neurology and sleep expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, in New York City.

Ebben explains that a temporary lull in energy levels, or a little sleepiness around mid-late afternoon, isn’t really due to fatigue but a dip in your circadian rhythms, or internal body clock, which play a key role in regulating your sleep/wake cycles.

“Your underlying sleep drive changes throughout the day,” Ebben explains. “Most people have a little dip in circadian rhythms mid-afternoon, depending on when they sleep and wake up, usually between 1-4 pm. When you have this dip, you can feel sleepy for a half an hour to an hour.” This mid-afternoon lull is usually when we tend to reach for a cup of coffee, or something sweet, to give our energy levels a boost to get through the rest of the work day.

Is it just the midday slump or something more?

Ebben says the first step to figure out if sleep or fatigue is causing your lack of energy is, quite simply, to get more sleep and see. If you sleep a lot longer past your weekday alarm on weekends, your body might be trying to make up for lost time. “Let’s say your alarm wakes you up every day at 6 am, but you’re sleepy during the day. On the weekends, without an alarm, you sleep until 9. What that tells you is you’re chronically sleep deprived during the week,” he explains.

Fatigue, however, is another story — and the common culprit likely won’t surprise you. “Stress is a common cause of fatigue in that it results in the release of inflammatory molecules that enter the brain and cause the feeling of fatigue,” says Peg Baim, M.S., N.P., director of clinical training at Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

A better way to boost your energy levels

Regardless of root cause, how can we best pull through these energy lulls without reaching for coffee and sugary treats? We enlisted the help of a few experts to share energy hacks we busy people can employ when we’re at a low ebb.

1. Get a move on first thing

Studies show that exercise improves cognition and releases endorphins — also known as feel-good hormones—that boost your mood and energy levels, especially after high-intensity workouts. So, if you’re dragging yourself out of bed and need to wake up quick, a few burpees (5-10) will maximize blood flow to your brain and body and help you get alert, says Bo Babenko, DPT, a physical therapist at Halevy Life.

2. Eat breakfast

Though it’s tempting to subsist on coffee until lunchtime, studies show that eating breakfast can slightly boost your brain power. And, as we’ve reported before, having a protein-packed meal first thing can help silence signals in your brain that can lead to sugar cravings later on, trigger signals in your brain that make you feel full.

3. Get up out of your chair

To keep your energy flowing throughout the day, be sure to take movement breaks. “When it comes to fighting fatigue, exercise is key,” says Baim. “Aim for 30 minutes 5 days a week, at least 4 hours before sleep,” she recommends. If you start to feel droopy at your desk, Babenko says these chair press-ups (make sure the chair is sturdy) are his go-to recommendation for office workers who need a quick pick-me-up. Or, if you’re sagging through through a marathon meeting or long client dinner, he recommends sneaking into the restroom to do 10 squats for a quick pick-me-up.

4. Combine protein and carbs for meals and snacks

That 4 o’clock sugar craving may feel like it’s giving you a boost, but the blood sugar crash you’ll feel a few hours afterward will leave you ready for bed right after dinner. To keep your energy levels (and mood) even, snack on a combo of protein and carbs — like yogurt with fruit and nuts or a protein shake with fruits blended in — says Deena Adimoolam, assistant professor of Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

5. Mellow out in the evening

As Baim mentioned above, stress is a common cause of fatigue. So how can we best de-stress when we don’t have 90 minutes for a yoga class? “Positive thoughts buffer stress, so keep your brain out of trouble 2-3 hours pre-sleep,” she recommends. “All negative thoughts turn on the brain’s stress response and will make it harder to get high quality sleep, or to fall and stay asleep. Instead of worrying, focus on positive thoughts, such as positive expectations and appreciations.” She also recommends meditation as a way to counter stress and lead the brain into the same EEG pattern as the first stage of sleep, so you can ease yourself into bed time and catch the z’s you so desperately need. These apps and expert Zen hacks can help you get started.

6. Get to bed on time — consistently

“Our culture works against sleep so most don’t realize how essential sleep is to overall mood, energy, stress tolerance, metabolism and even appetite drives,” says Baim. Ebben also says getting enough sleep usually helps boost alertness the next day. But aside from what you might read, sleep solutions aren’t one-size-fits-all. “You’d never go into a shoe store and ask for the national average sized shoe,” says Ebben. “Like any biological system, you, as an individual, have to figure out how much sleep you need.”

To get more sleep during the week, Ebben recommends slowly dialing back your bed time by 15 minutes, every five days or so. If you find yourself staring at the ceiling instead of passing out, you might be in bed too early. Once you find your sweet spot, stick to it consistently to maintain your sleep quality — sleeping in on weekends can cause you to stay up past your bedtime, making it that much harder to adjust come Monday morning — and to do those burpees.

The Hollywood Reporter's chief critic called Bay Jones ""the show's secret weapon."" Last night, she won the Tony Award for best actress in a musical.

Born to two stage actors in Florida, Rachel dropped out of high school and spent years honing her craft in theaters all over the country — from Hawaii to North Carolina to the Great White Way. Speaking of her three-decade career, Bay Jones told The Hollywood Reporter, ""I really believe we're always getting ready. Everyone's go-time is different.""

NBC News BETTER caught up with Jones in her dressing room just moments before curtain call to find what keeps her fearless and inspired in her Broadway home away from home.

Every time I brush my teeth, I look to my good friend, Mr. Shark. And it kinda reminds me to just get in the water, face your fear and do it anyway.

What inspired you to become an actor?

Both of my parents were stage actors so my inspiration came from seeing their fearlessness on stage and their passion for theater.

What's your morning routine like?

Before I get up I think about any dreams I had — or anything that requires creativity or difficult thought. That middle place between sleeping and waking is the best for knowing what you really want.

Then, coffee! I try to make my bed. And I keep my phone on silent for a little while so I can get my bearings before the world calls me away from myself.

I'm really scared of sharks. I grew up in Florida and swam a lot in the ocean. And that was, and is, probably my biggest fear. So sometimes it's pretty scary going out on stage. And since my dressing room is my office, and also my bathroom, and my morning routine, every time I brush my teeth, I look to my good friend, Mr. Shark — Mr. Great White Terrifying Shark. And we brush our teeth together. And it kinda reminds me to just get in the water, face your fear and do it anyway.

When you did really feel like you ""made it?""

Ummm... (Editor's note: She won a Tony Award!)

That middle place between sleeping and waking is the best for knowing what you really want.

What's on your nightstand right now?

A long dead Kindle because I like paper best. I have a hardcover signed first edition of Moonglow by Michael Chabon — I love him and I love this book. A tiny antique bell. Three pairs of scuffed reading glasses. And layers of tangled necklaces hanging from a hundred and fifty year old clock. I have a big nightstand!

This starts with using a broad-spectrum sunscreen moisturizer with an SPF of 30 on exposed skin year-round.

“Preventing wrinkle formation can also be achieved by the reduction of inflammation through antioxidants which should be used in combination with sunscreens and retinoids to enhance their protective effect,” Shah adds. So look for a serum with antioxidant ingredients: vitamin C and green tea extract are two of Shah’s favorites. Says Marnie Nussbaum, MD, dermatologist in New York City, “Vitamin C is my go to as a potent antioxidant ingredient. It works very well in combination with vitamin E and ferulic acid to protect against free radical damage which can cause skin cancers and collagen breakdown leading to fine lines.”

Speaking of retinoids (a derivative of vitamin A), it’s pretty much the gold standard when it comes to anti-aging ingredients. “Retinoids or retinol has been studied for anti-aging and has been shown to help promote skin turnover, which brings new skin cells to the surface and promotes collagen production, preventing the formation of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Marisa Garshick, MD, dermatologist at MDCS: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery in New York City.

Another good ingredient to look for in anti-aging products: hyaluronic acid, “which is a natural sugar molecule that occurs in our body and helps to attract water, so it functions as a great moisturizer,” says Garshick. “It keeps the skin looking fresh and hydrated.” And don’t forget about glycolic acid: It exfoliates skin to help with skin texture and pore size, says Melanie Kingsley, MD, dermatologist at IU Health.

Also pay attention to your eyes. “The skin around your eyes is thin and vulnerable,” Shah says. “Choose an eye-specific product to ensure that you're using a formula designed to minimize any skin reactions in this area, whether you prefer peptides or retinol.” (According to Shah, peptides aid in wound healing and minimizing the look of wrinkles.)

Below, top dermatologists share their favorite anti-aging products for a more youthful look.

The best sunscreens and moisturizers to help promote healthy skin

Dermatologists swear by EltaMD for its cosmetically elegant sunscreen formulas (no white cast here!) that contain added anti-aging ingredients. This one earns particular raves. “It’s moisturizing and it protects my skin from dark spots, wrinkles and skin cancer,” says Shah. “It also contains niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and lactic acid — ingredients that promote the appearance of healthy-looking skin.”

Guanche is a fan of this anti-aging serum because it “provides immediate skin tightening, as well as long term anti-aging results, so you get immediate gratification as well as long term help.” She adds that this serum makes a nice primer under makeup, meaning you won’t have to worry about your foundation balling up.

This serum packs a one-two punch, thanks to the retinol and hyaluronic acid in its formula. “This retinoid serum visibly fills and reduces wrinkles, giving skin a smoother and more plumped appearance,” says Howard D. Sobel, MD, New York City dermatologist and founder of Sobel Skin.

Sometimes a skin care product is worth the splurge, and this is one that continually makes the list of most beloved anti-aging products by top dermatologists. “It has the power of two anti-aging serums packed into one pump,” says Libby Rhee, DO, dermatologist in New York City. One side contains a growth factor serum that restores plumpness and diminishes fine lines, while the other side features a serum chock full of antioxidants to even skin tone and smooth skin texture. “You get all that with one pump, which is helpful when you’re busy or you have a multi-step skin care routine,” says Rhee.

Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, dermatologist in Los Angeles, likes this multi-purpose serum because it contains a number of anti-aging ingredients to target different signs of aging. Hyaluronic acid draws hydration into the top layers of skin for a temporary plumping effect; ferulic acid helps undo UV and pollution-related free radical damage; alpha hydroxy acids gently exfoliate dull dead skin cells that can settle into fine lines; and retinol stimulates new collagen growth.

Nussbaum recommends a vitamin C serum in the morning, because it offers potent antioxidant protection against free radical molecules that damage skin. It also brightens. She likes this one, which combines vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid to rejuvenate skin and prevent new damage.

You don’t always have to shell out major dough to reap anti-aging benefits. Shainhouse sings the praises of this drugstore staple: “It has the efficacy promised by expensive, beauty-counter products,” she says. That’s thanks to the potent ingredients in its formula, including hyaluronic acid to plump skin, niacinamide to soothe redness, dimethicone to lock in hydration, and peptide fragments to prompt skin to produce new collagen over time.

Consider this another reason to hit up your local drugstore. “This budget-friendly night treatment contains both alpha hydroxy acids, which help to unstick and exfoliate dulling, dead skin cells immediately, as well as retinol, which stimulates cell turnover and new collagen production over time,” says Shainhouse. “Together, these help to reduce the appearance of fine lines with regular use over two to three months.”

“Uneven and dull skin tone can actually give a more aging impression that fine lines and wrinkles,” points out Shainhouse. Enter this dark spot corrector, which relies on lightening ingredients like turmeric, birch bark and rice bran extract to fade the appearance of hyperpigmentation.

The delicate skin around your eyes deserves special care. “This anti-aging eye cream with retinol visibly reduces the appearance of crow’s feet wrinkles and the look of dark circles,” Sobel says.

Talk about a triple threat: This 3-in-1 eye product is Adigun’s go-to eye treatment because it acts as an eye cream, concealer and sunscreen. “It’s infused with hyaluronic acid and peptides to help reduce the appearance of fine lines,” she says. “The peach tint covers dark circles beautifully, and there’s an SPF 30 to protect the delicate eye area from sun damage.

Across the country, business are slowly reopening after months of closures in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic. Whether you're venturing out more than before and spending time in the sun or keeping to your home and dealing with warming temperatures, your skin care hasn't lost its importance. If your skin looks as shiny as a disco ball come lunchtime, then congratulations: You have oily skin. Now, don’t get us wrong, some oil in your skin is good.

IN THIS ARTICLE A skincare routine that will control oil production | Best skincare products for oily skin

“When the oil on the skin is the right amount, it protects our skin from external toxic elements,” says Yoram Harth, MD, a dermatologist and medical director of MDacne. “That said, having too much of it makes our skin shiny, can clog our skin pores and causes acne breakouts.”

So what causes oily skin in the first place? Common culprits include genetics, a humid environment, hormonal changes, medications that affect your hormones and sugary and fatty foods, says Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor of DermBoard.org.

The good news is, it is possible to get oily skin under control, and it starts with finding the right skincare products. “In order to balance the oiliness of their skin, people with oily skin need to look for products that will remove excess oil from their skin without over-drying,” Harth says.

A skincare routine that will control oil production

Products should be non-comedogenic, meaning they don’t clog pores, and oil-free, says Melanie Palm, MD, a dermatologist in San Diego. Look for labels that have active ingredients that help your oil glands function more normally, like sulfur, retinol and salicylic acid, suggests Palm. “Lighter formulations are likely to be tolerated better,” she adds. “These include serums, gels or lotions rather than creams or ointments.”

When it comes to cleansing, being gentle is key. So is keeping exfoliating to a minimum (once or twice a week tops), says Lisa Pruett, MD, a dermatologist in Carrollton, Texas. That’s because over-cleansing and scrubbing too harshly can lead to increased oil production, Pruett explains. Using a clay mask twice a week will help control excess oil, adds Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. Moisturizing daily is important (no matter how counter-intuitive that sounds if you have oily skin), and so is wearing sunscreen, says Pruett.

Ready to upgrade your skin care routine? Below, dermatologists share their favorite skincare products to help those with oily skin keep their complexion clear and shine-free.

The best skincare products for oily skin

Kenneth Mark, MD, a dermatologist and Moh’s skin cancer surgeon in New York City, likes this facial cleanser, which contains 2 percent salicylic acid to unclog pores and prevent future blackheads. The oil-free formula deeply cleanses without over-stripping skin, so your face will never feel tight or dry.

This cleanser is a favorite of Joshua Zeichner, MD, a dermatologist in New York City, because it’s non-comedogenic and utilizes salicylic acid to treat existing breakouts and fight new ones. This cleanser also contains soy to help even out the look of your skin tone.

“This cleanser has a great combination of glycolic and salicylic acids that can help to remove excess oil,” says Palm. Jojoba oil ensures skin will feel soft and smooth post-cleansing.

This drugstore cleanser is a go-to of Shari Sperling, DO, a dermatologist in Florham Park, New Jersey. The non-comedogenic formula lightly foams to remove excess oil without over-stripping skin.

Plam suggests using this sonic cleansing brush once a day to make cleansing more effective. The brush is gentle enough that even sensitive skin types can use it, yet powerful enough that it removes makeup. It’s also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower.

Toning can help get rid of any excess oil that wasn’t removed from cleansing. “This toner includes witch hazel to remove excess sebum as well as glycolic acid to chemically exfoliate the surface of the skin and aloe vera to soothe and hydrate with its anti-inflammatory and humectant properties,” says King.

Palm likes this face mask because it draws out impurities and controls oil, thanks to the 6.4 percent sulfur in the formula. This oil-free mask also minimizes the appearance of pores.

Sperling likes this clay-based mask for oily skin. Formulated with salicylic acid in addition to clay, this mask works in five minutes to deeply clean and unclog pores without irritation.

“This can be used as either a face mask or a cleanser,” says King, “and either way, the kaolin clay absorbs oils and reduces shine.” It also features a mild amount of salicylic acid to gently exfoliate and remove excess oil and vitamin E for antioxidant protection.

This non-comedogenic and oil-free moisturizer is a great pick for oily skin, says Sperling. It has a matte finish, so you don’t have to worry about looking shiny, and it contains SPF 30 for that much-needed sun protection.

One of the most beloved sunscreens of dermatologists, Pruett notes that it can double as a moisturizer. Palm likes this one because it’s non-comedogenic and free of heavy ingredients. “The zinc oxide and niacinamide in the formula are anti-inflammatory and do not promote oil production,” says Palm.

If you have oily skin, chances are you’ve skipped sunscreen at some point because it can make your skin even shinier. Susan Bard, MD, a dermatologist in New York City, says this one is great for people with oily skin or those who get shiny when they use sunscreen. It’s formulated with tapioca starch to absorb excess oil.

“This is a product that photographers and makeup artists have used for years to combat oily skin on set,” Pruett notes. “The product absorbs facial oils, acting like a leave-on blotting paper throughout the day.”

Best gifts for cooks and home chefs

If hosting a barbecue means your husband or father spends the entire afternoon behind the grill, this handy tech tool could be their new best friend. The wireless meat thermometer takes all the guesswork out of cooking the perfect slab of meat — whether they’re roasting chicken, cooking steaks or grilling salmon. All they have to do is insert the thermometer into the meat, select the type of item on the grill, and the app will estimate the cook time. The convenient countdown clock shows how much time is remaining so he can crack open a cold one and enjoy the BBQ — instead of having to “man” the grill all afternoon.

Heat dispersion is even, cleanup is a breeze, and these pots and pans can handle the oven, the stove, and a regular beating without getting banged up.

183,2020-06-04 15:31:43+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/tax-day-coming-soon-what-you-need-july-15-ncna1224746,Tax Day is coming soon. What you need for July 15,"Call it the never-ending tax season.

It may be hard to believe, but taxpayers have approximately six weeks to file their 2019 income tax returns and pay taxes owed to the IRS.

July 15 is the new Tax Day, as the Treasury Department moved the deadline to help taxpayers contend with disruption related to the coronavirus pandemic.

For accountants, the new deadline is added stress. Many have been spending the last two months guiding small businesses through the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program -- and they’re swamped.

“What we’d normally be doing in March and April is what we’re getting into now,” said Brian Streig, CPA and tax director at Calhoun Thomson and Matza in Austin.

“Now you have all of these tax returns, and we’re getting them all done by July 15,” he said. “We’re in extension mode, like we would’ve been back in March.”

Tax filers who aren’t confident they’ll get their paperwork ready by next month can request an extension.

That would give them until Oct. 15 to submit returns, but they’ll still need to pay any taxes owed by July 15.

What needs to be in

The due date for 2019 individual income tax returns, along with that year’s tax payment, are just two of the items that were pushed into July.

People who pay quarterly estimated taxes – for instance, independent contractors – were also given until July 15 to cover amounts due for the first and second quarter of 2020.

Ordinarily, those deadlines would have been April 15 and June 15, respectively.

Further, Americans abroad, who would have normally had until June 15 to submit their 2019 tax return, now have until next month to file and pay taxes due.

The IRS compiled a list of spring deadlines that have been pushed into July here.

Just as filers have more time to turn in last year’s tax returns, they also have extra time to top off their savings accounts.

You have until July 15 to save up to $6,000 in your individual retirement account (plus $1,000 if you’re 50 and over), and have the contribution count for 2019.

Many savers can also claim a tax deduction for making that IRA contribution, based on their modified adjusted gross income for 2019, even if they had a retirement plan at work.

If you were in a high-deductible health plan, you can also stash more money into a health savings account.

You normally save in an HSA on a tax-deductible or pretax basis and have your money grow tax free over time. If you use the proceeds to cover qualified medical costs, you can do so tax free.

For 2019, the maximum contribution is $3,500 for self-only coverage ($7,000 for family plans). Accountholders turning 55 can throw in an extra $1,000.

Regroup and file

Don’t wait until the day before the deadline to pluck last-minute deductions and credits.

You might qualify for a couple of “tax extenders,” a package of tax breaks that must be renewed by legislators each year. Those write-offs include a $4,000 deduction for tuition and fees for your college student – and you don’t have to itemize on your taxes to scoop this one up.

You won’t know you qualify until you perform an inventory of your statements from last year, of course.

Taxpayers should also pay close attention to what’s going on at the state level. While most states have pushed their filing deadlines to July 15, not all of them have. Filers in Virginia, for instance, were supposed to pay individual and corporate income taxes by June 1.

The American Institute of CPAs keeps a list of states and their deadline updates here.

Finally, if you’re due a refund and you need the money, hustle your paperwork to the IRS. The taxman issued 89.8 million refunds as of May 22, giving filers an average check of $2,772.

“If you’re getting a refund, just file your return and get it,” said Thomas Neuhoff, CPA at Henry & Peters in Tyler, Texas.

How they weather the disruption may depend on the response they see from their parents, says California Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris.

“They really get their cues about what this means from their caregivers,” says Dr. Burke Harris, a pediatrician and expert on child stress. “And so there’s an incredible opportunity for caregivers to be a buffer to the stress of the current situation.”

Many parents interviewed by TODAY about how their children view the crisis expressed frustration about not being present enough for their children. They worried about not getting enough work done and fretted that they weren’t making this time as enriching as possible.

Experts in child development encourage parents to relax and focus on bonding and connection.

“This is not about perfection in any way. This is about being good enough,” says Dr. Tovah Klein, director of Barnard’s Center for Toddler Development. “Be reasonable. What you could do before, you cannot do now and that’s OK.”

Here are 9 ways to help your children through the coronavirus crisis.

1. Lower your standards. No, lower.

This one might be hard: Lower your expectations for your children, who might be struggling in ways you can’t yet understand, and lower expectations for yourself as a parent, partner and employee.

Working parents simply can't do what they used to do at work for now, or be as attentive to their children as they would have been on a day when they aren't working.

“We have to set different expectations for ourselves,” says Jennifer Miller, a family educational consultant and author of “Confident Parents, Confident Kids.”

Parents shouldn't feel guilty about doing what they have no choice but to do.

“When your child is asking you to play and you can’t, I think it’s time for a really good hug and a move on,” Miller says.

""I miss being with my friends and interacting with them in the hallways and lunch,"" said 17-year-old Hamiz Qadri. Nathan Congleton / TODAY

2. Talk about feelings

Discuss what’s going on in kid friendly terms. Don’t try to pretend everything is fine.

“We know from research and from common sense that children can’t learn if they are having big feelings like fear and worry, and we know that they are having those feelings,” says Jennifer Miller, a family and educational consultant and author of “Confident Parents, Confident Kids.”

Miller says just acknowledging feelings is powerful. Then, help guide them to simple and healthy coping strategies, like stopping to put a hand on their chest and feel their heartbeats, breathing deeply or going outside for fresh air.

“Giving them messages that we’re going to be OK is really important and really will help children bounce back,” says Klein, author of “How Toddlers Thrive.” “Children respond to the adults in their life.”"

Sure, your at-home workouts are keeping you in shape, but a daily walk can boost your mental health and has many social and emotional benefits.

“Walking allows you to see other people and say hello at a safe distance. That brief social interaction is enough to boost your mood and make you smile. It’s also a nice change of scenery,” says Michele Stanten, an ACE-certified trainer and author of “Walk Off Weight.” “I like taking socially distanced walks with a friend. We’re able to spread far apart while carrying on a conversation. It allows you to physically be with a friend and exercise,” she says.

Walking also offers the opportunity to connect with nature, relieve stress and bring more mindfulness to your day. “Although walking is a benefit at any time, going for a meditative walk during quarantine is of particular value,” says Alexis Santos, a meditation teacher featured on Ten Percent Happier, a mindfulness and meditation app. “Going for a walk helps to break the patterns of thought and anxiety that we may be getting swept up into. It’s a great way to push the reset button.”

If you’re spending most of your day sitting in front of your computer, walking is also an excellent way to reduce pain. “Your joints stiffen up throughout the day, especially if you’re sitting often, so walking helps loosen things up and improve blood circulation,” Stanten says.

Ready to mask up and go for a walk? Stanten and Santos share how to turn your socially distanced walks into a workout or a meditative experience.

How to burn more calories and build strength while walking

Stanten gives pointers on how to supercharge your daily walk:

Walk with good posture. “Stand up tall and bend your arms, keeping them close to the body —not flailing them up high,” Stanten says. Contrary to what most people think, she advises taking shorter steps. “Land your foot in front of your body to move more fluidly and faster. Taking larger steps makes it harder to pull your body forward,” she says.

Contrary to what most people think, she advises taking shorter steps. “Land your foot in front of your body to move more fluidly and faster. Taking larger steps makes it harder to pull your body forward,” she says. Change up the terrain. Walk on grass, sand, dirt paths, flat roads, up hills and down hills to challenge your body. “If you can find a hill to walk on, it will provide a great incline and get your heart rate going. The wind resistance also feels different on a hill and makes it more challenging to move against it,” Stanten says.

The wind resistance also feels different on a hill and makes it more challenging to move against it,” Stanten says. Pick up the pace. Incorporate intervals into your walk by alternating between bouts of intense effort with a slower-paced trot. “Aim to walk towards something, like a lamp post or stop sign. Walk fast for 30 seconds or one block and walk slower for 60 seconds or two blocks,” Stanten says. Listening to music? Speed up with the chorus of a song and slow down during the verses. Count the number of steps you take during an interval and try to beat that number in the same amount of time.

Stanten recommends mixing in some bodyweight exercises, like lunges with rotation, heel raises, push-ups and squats. “You can also bring a longer resistance band with you and loop it around a sturdy pole to do lat pull-downs and rows,” Stanten says. Use mini bands for lateral squat walks and glute kickbacks.

How to take a meditative walk to reduce stress

Santos shares tips to make your walk more mindful:

Be mindful of your surroundings. To make your walk more relaxing, Santos says choosing more peaceful walking paths can help. “If possible, find walks that have some nature elements like trees and water. These tend to be soothing for the mind,” he says.

Focus on your own thoughts. If you can’t find isolated walking paths, Santos says working with your own thoughts can be effective in easing the mind. “When you see people not wearing masks, Santos says you can turn your negative thoughts into a more positive wish, like ‘may they be safe and healthy.’ It’s important that our efforts to stay healthy don’t slide into fear and anxiety of each other,” Santos cautions.

Walk with intention. Avoid going on autopilot during your walk, Santos says. Turn your attention to what is going on around you and allow your body to move in a relaxed way. Notice how your feet are touching the ground, the way your legs and arms are swinging and your lungs filling up with air. This will change your perspective and draw awareness to the benefits, such as the warm sun and the alone time.

186,2020-05-29 14:52:42+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/5-exercises-tighten-tone-your-arms-summer-ncna1008266,5 exercises to tighten and tone your arms for summer,"We all have those trouble zones we're self-conscious about and want to tone up. Perhaps it’s your midsection or your glutes. For many, upper arms top the list, and this is the time of year this insecurity is brought to light.

The good news is that by adding the right exercises to your workout routine you can start strengthening the muscles in your arms rather quickly. One of my clients added a 5-minute arm routine to her typical workout routine and noticed a change after just three sessions. Within a week she already felt more confident in her sleeveless tops and dresses.

If tightening and toning the arms is on your list of summer goals, try adding these exercises to your fitness regimen three times a week. I recommend performing them with 3-5 pound dumbbells. Remember that some exercises may be easier than others, so it’s okay to alternate between weights based on what feels right for your body.

My favorite way to put these exercises together is to perform one set of 10 repetitions of each, and then repeat the whole circuit three times. In the end, you’ll complete 30 repetitions total of each exercise.

Bicep Curls

The bicep curl is the quintessential arm exercise. It tones and strengthens the front of the arms, which many people associate with the ability to “flex a muscle.”

To perform this exercise, grab your dumbbells and start with your arms by your sides. Hug your elbows in towards the side of your body, and then curl the weights up towards your shoulders. Be careful not to let your arms swing. (If you need to swing your arms and use momentum to get the weight up, you are likely using too heavy of a weight.) Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Tricep Kickbacks

The triceps are what people are referring to when they say that their arms are flabby. This is the part of the arm that jiggles when you wave. (During one of my workout segments for the “Today Show,” Kathie Lee called them bat wings!) In order to tighten this area and reduce ""jiggle"" it’s necessary to strengthen the backs of the arms. The most basic dumbbell exercise to accomplish this is a tricep kickback. Holding weights in both hands, lean forward with a flat back. Hug your elbows in towards your sides and pull them up towards the ceiling. Keeping your elbows still, kick the weight towards the back of the room by moving the lower half of your arm back and up towards the ceiling. Hold for a second, feeling the back of your arm tighten, and then release back to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Hug a Tree

This exercise works the biceps from a different angle, while also working the sides of the chest (and that pesky area by the armpits) and sculpting the shoulders. Hold the weights at shoulder height, parallel to the floor. Relax the shoulders down, and then hug the arms towards the front of your body as if you’re hugging a tree. Keep the elbows level with your shoulders — don’t let them dip down — and be conscious of the shoulders starting to raise up towards your ears, which means the weight is too heavy or you’re too fatigued. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Serve the Platter

This move is a three-in-one, working the biceps, shoulder and chest. Start with your arms at your side, bending your elbows at 90 degrees. Reach the arms forward, straightening them as if you’re serving a platter, then reach them out to the sides in a “T” position, back to center, and then pull them back in towards you. Keep the palms facing up the entire time. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

V exercises

The ultimate toner for the front of the shoulder is the V exercise. For this exercise, hold your dumbbells down at your hips. Then reach the weights forward and up on an angle, drawing a V, and then release them back down towards your hips. Keep the arms straight throughout the entire exercise. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

187,2019-05-12 14:03:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/4-batch-cocktail-recipes-your-warm-weather-parties-ncna1003496,4 make-ahead batch cocktail recipes for spring and summer parties,"In college I was a beer drinker, reaching for inexpensive Rolling Rocks. More recently, I’ve discovered the small-production wines from vineyards near my home in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley. But last October when I visited the Jameson Distillery in Dublin, I tried a Tamarind Sour, and fell in love with cocktails.

Since then, I’ve been squeezing fresh lemons for juice, making my own honey syrup, and tackling classics like the Whiskey Sour and the Old Fashioned. And I’ve discovered that it’s easy enough to craft a cocktail or two with my husband on a weekend. But add just a couple more people, and all that measuring, mixing and shaking can get to be a lot of work.

The solution? Batch cocktails. Maggie Hoffman’s book, ""Batch Cocktails: Make-Ahead Pitcher Drinks for Every Occasion"" features 65 eight-to-10 serving cocktail recipes — including seven nonalcoholic versions — that can be prepared mostly in advance.

“When you’re inviting people over and gathering together for a meal, barbecue or picnic, what you really want to do is spend time with friends and family,” Hoffman says. “If you’re muddling, putting drinks in a cocktail shaker, shaking and straining, you’re missing out on the hanging-out-with-people part.”

Ready to give it a go? Here are four of Hoffman’s top choices for warm-weather entertaining.

Grab a big thermos and take the celery-based Infinity Pool along on hot summer days, Hoffman says. “It’s almost like a celery margarita. The mezcal is so earthy and smoky, and the celery juice and lemon juice are so refreshing. It’s perfect for summer,” she says.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

Hoffman pairs America’s pastime with Riled and Wrangled, a spicy shandy that has little in common with the beer-and-lemonade variety. You can make this batch cocktail with kolsh or pilsner, which gives you the option to serve up a cooler full of bottles or cans on the side for your beer-purist guests.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

For a backyard brunch or engagement party, Hoffman recommends Birds Again. “It’s lovely — light in alcohol and super quick to make. The fresh basil gives it a bright spring flavor that is a real favorite. It’s definitely good for daytime,” Hoffman says. Up your entertaining game by adding the optional edible rosebuds or rose petals.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

Hoffman suggests serving at least one non-alcoholic cocktail when you entertain. “Everybody deserves something special,” Hoffman says. Her go-to choice? The grapefruit-and-honey-based Blaylock. “It sounds simple but it’s magically complex tasting. It’s somehow rich, really good, and so easy to make,” she says.

TIPS FOR A WINNING COCKTAIL ANYTIME

Hoffman’s recipes will step you through the prep and serving, and she also offers these tips if you’re new to batch cocktails:

Measure your container before you start batching. You don’t want to run out of room and discover you still need to add an ounce of lime juice and ice.

You don’t want to run out of room and discover you still need to add an ounce of lime juice and ice. The first time you use a punch bowl fill it with water to test for cracks, especially if you found it at a flea market or yard sale. “I’ve been at a party where there’s been a crack, and it’s all over the table,” Hoffman says.

especially if you found it at a flea market or yard sale. “I’ve been at a party where there’s been a crack, and it’s all over the table,” Hoffman says. Choose quality ingredients. Punches get a bad rap, but that partly comes from people making compromises when they make big batches. Hoffman points out that you can find fresh juice at juice bars and many grocery stores if you don’t have the time to make your own.

When you’re adding liquids, keep your measuring cup on the counter. If you hold it over the pitcher or punch bowl and overpour you could have an extra tablespoon or more in your drink.

If you hold it over the pitcher or punch bowl and overpour you could have an extra tablespoon or more in your drink. Taste test, and trust your taste buds. Ingredients aren’t always exactly the same. Your sparkling wine might be sweeter than the one Hoffman used when creating her recipe. Some grapefruits are more sour while others are sweeter. Spice levels might need adjusting.

Bonus tip: If you’re hooked on batch cocktails you can age these drinks in your fridge, like wine. “I’ve been opening some that are a year old and they’re so good,” Hoffman says. “They’re soft and smooth and rich and mellow. They’re ready to go and it feels luxurious.” She says if you’re aging cocktails more than two weeks, leave out the water and bitters and add them when you serve the drink.

You’ve probably had a pisco sour or a sidecar. But what happens when you skip the strong spirit and pour in tangy Sauvignon Blanc and herbal dry vermouth instead? Scented with basil and rose water, this low-proof easy drinker from Shaun Traxler of Vault in Fayetteville, Arkansas, is bright and refreshing but still more cocktail than sangria. Chill the wine and vermouth before you begin, and if you really want to ace the presentation, garnish the pitcher with food-grade rosebuds or rose petals. You’ll need one large or two small bottles of vermouth for this recipe.

Birds Again

Makes about 13 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

15 fresh basil leaves, torn in half

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons 1:1 simple syrup (recipe follows)

1 1/4 teaspoons rose water

2 1/4 cups chilled Sauvignon Blanc

2 1/4 cups chilled dry vermouth (such as Dolin)

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

TO SERVE

About 13 edible rosebuds or rose petals (optional)

13 fresh basil leaves

Freshly ground black pepper (optional)

Up to 2 hours before serving, make the batch. Place basil leaves, simple syrup, and rose water in a 2-quart pitcher. Tap basil gently with a muddler or long wooden spoon, just enough to coax the flavor out; don’t pulverize it. Pour in chilled Sauvignon Blanc, chilled vermouth, and lime juice and stir well to mix. If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

To serve, stir mixture well. Garnish pitcher with rosebuds or rose petals, if desired. Pour cocktail into ice-filled wineglasses or rocks glasses and garnish each glass with a basil leaf and freshly ground pepper, if desired.

1:1 SIMPLE SYRUP

Makes about 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons

3/4 cup sugar

3/4 cup very hot water

Combine sugar and hot water in a resealable container, such as a mason jar, and stir to dissolve slightly. As soon as it’s cool enough to handle, seal container and shake until sugar is completely dissolved. Let cool completely and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

It’s one of those perfect combinations, so it’s not shocking that the pairing works in a glass, too, as Milwaukee’s Adam James Sarkis demonstrates with this recipe. It couldn’t be simpler to combine honey, grapefruit, lemon, and seltzer, but the mixture is surprisingly complex in flavor, both tangy and rich. Make sure you have nine or ten grapefruits; yields will depend on whether you’re using an electric juicer or squeezing them by hand. Prep the honey syrup at least an hour — and up to a week — in advance, so it’s properly cooled when you start the batch.

The Blaylock

Makes about 16 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

4 1/2 cups fresh pink grapefruit juice

1 cup plus

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons chilled 2:1 honey syrup (recipe follows)

TO SERVE

16 star anise pods(optional)

2 (1 L) bottles chilled seltzer

Lemon wedges (optional)

Up to 2 hours before serving, make the batch. Prepare grapefruit and lemon juices and pour into a 2-quart pitcher. Add chilled honey syrup and stir well to mix. If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

To serve, toast star anise pods (if desired) over high heat in a dry skillet, watching carefully, just until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Fill tall glasses with ice, then carefully fill glasses about halfway with chilled seltzer. Top with pitcher mix, give each glass one gentle stir, then garnish with star anise pod and lemon wedge, if desired.

2:1 HONEY SYRUP

Makes about 1 1/3 cups

1 cup honey

1/2 cup water

Combine honey and water in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is uniformly blended. Do not let boil. Pour into a resealable container and let cool. Seal well and refrigerate for up to 1 month.

Serrano-spiked honey and herb-inflected green Chartreuse enhance the peppery notes of whiskey and crisp kölsch or pilsner. Individual peppers can pack a varying amount of heat; if you’re nervous, use just a single chile.

Riled and Wrangled

Makes about 16 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

2 cups rye (such as Rittenhouse)

1 cup green Chartreuse

1 1/2 cups chilled serrano honey syrup (recipe follows)

1 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice

TO SERVE

6 bottles or cans chilled kölsch or pilsner

16 celery ribbons (shaved using a sharp vegetable peeler)

Up to 3 days before serving, make the batch. Pour rye, green Chartreuse, and chilled serrano honey syrup into a 2-quart pitcher and stir to mix. If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

Up to 2 hours before serving, prepare lemon juice and stir into pitcher mix. Reseal and return to refrigerator if not serving immediately.

To serve, stir mixture well. Fill pitcher with ice and stir gently until outside of pitcher is cool. Fill rocks glasses with ice, then carefully pour in kölsch to fill glass about halfway (letting foam settle). Top with pitcher mix and give each glass a quick stir. Adjust with additional beer or pitcher mix to taste, if desired. Garnish each glass with a ribbon of celery.

SERRANO HONEY SYRUP

Makes about 1 1/2 cups

1 to 1 1/2 serrano chiles, depending on heat desired

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon honey

Slice chiles thinly, discarding stems and seeds. Place in small saucepan and gently crush with a muddler (you don’t need to make a puree). Add water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat. When you spot the first bubble, turn heat to low and keep warm for 6 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a resealable container. Stir in honey until fully incorporated, then let cool and refrigerate until chilled or for up to 1 week.

Throw some chopped stalks in a juicer (or, if you’re patient, puree about a dozen in a blender and strain) and you’ve got one of the most refreshing cocktail bases I can imagine. Los Angeles bartender Gabriella Mlynarczyk knows how to use it well, mellowing out the vegetal character of the stalks with citrusy Lillet blanc and lemon juice. The drink’s savory side is supported with mezcal, celery bitters, and a pinch of smoked salt. You’ll want to pour it into a big thermos and bring it to the beach. Starting with chilled mezcal and Lillet means less time waiting for the fridge to do its job.

Infinity Pool

Makes about 10 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

1 1/3 cups chilled mezcal

1 1/3 cups chilled Lillet blanc

2/3 cup chilled 1:1 simple syrup(recipe follows)

2 1/4 teaspoons celery bitters

3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water

1 1/3 cups fresh celery juice (from about 12 celery stalks)

1 cup fresh lemon juice

TO SERVE

Smoked sea salt

Thinly sliced lemon wheels (optional)

Up to 1 day before serving, make the batch. Pour chilled mezcal, chilled Lillet blanc, chilled simple syrup, celery bitters, and water into a 2-quart pitcher and stir to mix. Seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

To serve, stir mixture well. Place a large ice cube in each rocks glass, then pour in cocktail and garnish with a small pinch of smoked salt and a lemon wheel, if desired.

USE IT UP

On Chicago bartender Chris Muscardin’s advice, skip the vermouth in your next martini and try Lillet blanc instead. Half and half is a lovely ratio to start with; up the gin if you like things drier. Lemon twist and orange bitters, if you please.

But you don’t have to turn to takeout to enjoy your favorite dishes. These food pros step you through healthier, less-expensive versions of top Indian picks you can make at home.

CHICKEN BIRYANI

Roxana Begum, a registered dietitian who blogs at the Delicious Crescent, says her childhood home, Hyderabad, India, is famous for its biryani. This easy, no-fuss chicken biryani recipe she shares cuts through the traditional steps without compromising on the “spectacular” biryani taste.

“This recipe gives me that authentic, mouth-watering biryani with tender spiced chicken and fluffy rice, every single time,” she says. “And for the cost of one biryani plate at a restaurant, you will get to feed the whole family with this easy homemade recipe!”

For can’t-fail rice, she recommends a rice cooker. “Using a rice cooker is a game changer that allows even the most novice of Indian cooks to try their hand at a true culinary masterpiece,” she says.

LAMB MEATBALLS WITH ORANGE GLAZE

Pankaj Bhadouria, the first MasterChef from India, loves the international appeal of this dish. “Call them meatballs or koftas, we see them being cooked all across the globe,” she says. “This version is slightly sweet, tangy, and salty, with a little heat coming in from the paprika. It would go well with rice, noodles, and breads alike, so it is a sure winner for me.”

Bhadouria bakes these lamb meatballs with orange glaze, using oil only to grease the baking tray, so she says they are healthier than most deep-fried takeout meatballs.

CHICKEN SHAWARMA

Ranveer Brar grew up on the streets of Lucknow, India, and the kebab vendors there inspired his career as a chef. “Shawarma is an offshoot of the doner kebab,” he says. “My version of chicken shawarma is an attempt to interpret the flavors and culture behind the original recipe while adding a touch of Indian to it.”

He likes how this dish is easy to prepare and uses less cooking fat than most versions, but still brings subtle nuances in flavor. While the recipe calls for a nonstick pan, Brar says the chicken could be oven grilled if you prefer.

LAMB ROGAN JOSH

Savita Verma, the blogger behind Chef De Home, says she grew up on Indian food and likes to make over restaurant recipes so they are simpler and healthier. She shares her version of lamb rogan josh, which you can prepare ahead of time in your slow cooker or Instant Pot.

This dish comes together without much effort, but is still packed with complex flavor. “The lamb comes out bone tender, and the curry is bursting with the flavor of the spices,” she says.

She loves to make a batch over the weekend and portion and freeze it: “On weeknights, heat it and enjoy a restaurant-quality Indian dinner without ordering delivery.”"
193,2020-05-29 14:32:19+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-make-perfect-pesto-5-recipes-get-you-started-ncna1042726,How to make the perfect pesto — and 5 recipes to get you started,"“What most people associate with pesto is classic pesto Genovese, which is the perfect balance of nutty, sweet, salty, buttery and umami,” TV personality, cookbook author, and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis tells NBC News BETTER. But in her own kitchen, De Laurentiis prefers to think about what pesto actually means, “any sauce that has been pounded or crushed.” Pesto comes from pestare, Italian for “to pound” or “to crush.”

The traditional blend of basil, garlic, Parmesan and pine nuts is an Italian classic for a reason, but being more flexible with your ingredient list “opens the door for so much more,” explains Laurentiis, who likes to make pesto with everything from parsley to peas to broccoli. Here, she shares pointers for achieving pesto perfection at home, plus five favorite recipes and creative ideas for using each one.

One of pesto’s selling points is that it can be made by hand, with a mortar and pestle or in a food processor. It all depends on how much time you have and what you prefer. For De Laurentiis, the answer is easy.

“Let’s be honest, I’m a busy mom, so the food processor is much easier and quicker for me to whip up any kind of pesto rather than pulling out the old mortar and pestle.” Regardless of method, De Laurentiis recommends starting with ingredients that take the longest to chop, such as garlic and any nuts, and adding more delicate ones like herbs and baby greens towards the end. “You don’t want to bruise them up too much,” she warns.

If you opt for using the food processor, “always pulse in the Parmesan or other cheese at the end or stir it in by hand,” says De Laurentiis. That way, the heat of the machine won’t melt the cheese.

Mix it up

As you can see from the recipes included here, pesto is ripe for experimentation, so take a cue from De Laurentiis and play with different combinations to suit your palate and the meal you want to make.

“Always think about balancing flavors and textures,” advises De Laurentiis. “For so few ingredients, pesto is rather complex, and you don’t want one ingredient to stand out too much from the others.” To achieve a balanced sauce, De Laurentiis says “to start slow and taste along the way.”

Go beyond pasta

Pesto and pasta may be perfect partners, but with such a versatile sauce, it would be a shame to limit yourself to penne and pappardelle. “There are so many uses!” insists De Laurentiis.

Add a little acid — think lemon juice or vinegar — to make a dressing for salads or a sauce for steak or fish. Another easy option is to stir pesto into Greek yogurt for an easy, creamy dip for vegetables or to spread over chicken before baking.

Store like a pro

Pesto may be easy to make but that doesn’t mean you want any to go to waste. Whether you make a big batch or just have some leftovers, proper storage is key. De Laurentiis recommends keeping pesto in an airtight container in the refrigerator, but it’s also important to take an extra step to keep your sauce fresh and green. “I always pour a layer of olive oil over the top and then place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the oil,” she says.

Pesto 5 ways

Orecchiette Pasta with Almond Pesto. Elizabeth Newman

This almost classic pesto features almonds in place of pine nuts. De Laurentiis adds creamy mozzarella, sweet cherry tomatoes and warm pasta for a fuss-free supper, but the vibrant sauce is also a great match for blanched green beans. Think of it as a new twist on green beans almondine, says De Laurentiis.

Orzo with Artichoke Pesto and Grilled Corn Elizabeth Newman

Frozen artichokes, toasted walnuts, parsley, oregano and a heavy hit of Parmesan come together in this unexpected take on pesto. In addition to the corn and orzo combo here, De Laurentiis likes to spread this pesto on chicken sandwiches.

Grilled Chicken and Broccoli Pesto Panini Food Network

Broccoli is blended with walnuts, lemon, Parmesan and a touch of honey to create a slightly heartier pesto that De Laurentiis serves with grilled chicken, thick rounds of beefsteak tomato, and rustic bread. For a play on a classic pasta, she recommends tossing this pesto with orecchiette and spicy Italian sausage.

Parsley Lemon Pesto Ray Kachatorian

This parsley, pine nut and lemon combination is a great year-round pesto and if you add a bit more olive oil to the mix, De Laurentiis says it makes a great dressing for greens or a flavor-packed sauce for grilled chicken or salmon.

Pea Pesto Crostini Elizabeth Newman

To create this yummy spread, De Laurentiis pulses frozen peas with garlic, Parmesan, olive oil, salt and pepper. It also makes a dynamite filling for tortellini. In fact, that’s how De Laurentiis uses it at her restaurant in Las Vegas.

194,2020-05-27 17:57:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-simple-financial-tweaks-can-help-you-survive-even-thrive-ncna1215586,These simple financial tweaks can help you survive — and even thrive — during the pandemic,"We are all getting back to the basics.

While it might feel good to bake bread, the best way to get through the coronavirus pandemic could be to stock your emergency fund and learn to “do-it-yourself” with household chores so you can save on expenses.

One bright spot: You might have more time on your hands.

Think optimistically. You can learn to DIY, sock away cash and set a disaster budget for tough times.

If you’ve been putting off thinking about money, now’s the time to dedicate those extra hours in the week — no more commuting, no more rushed work mornings — to shoring up your finances.

Be a bean counter

Hold off on panicking by looking ahead, says Sasha Hutchison, 38, an accounting manager and personal finance blogger in Austin, Texas.

Take a look at your net worth: what you owe, what you can do to bring in cash now. “It helps you to feel more in control,” Hutchison said.

When Hutchison says to look at everything, she means everything. A health savings account or a flexible spending account through your job can help pay for health care. How much cash do you have on hand? What’s in your portfolio, even if it’s shrinking? It might be a difficult time to collect from anyone who owes you money — but still good to know that it’s out there.

Cash-back credit cards can be another source. Groceries and gas help accumulate points quickly. (Hutchison pays off the balance each month.)

Cash cushion

Liz Gendreau, 39, says you'll never regret stashing cash against an emergency - even if one never materializes. Source: Liz Gendreau

An emergency fund is more critical than ever. In one week in March, things changed almost daily, says Liz Gendreau, 39, who blogs about family finance on her website, Chief Mom Officer.

“You might get reduced hours, a pay cut,” said Gendreau, who lives in Hartford County, Connecticut. “Before that happens, ideally, is the time to take a really close look at your budget.”

You’ll never regret having emergency savings — only not saving while you had the chance.

When things go back to the way they were, you can use that pile of cash to pay off debt or for something you wanted to do.

A budget for slim times

Got a budget? That’s great. Now might be a very good time to create and use the emergency version.

According to Heather Albrecht, 37, a financial coach in Hartford, Vermont, it’s best to make this plan before you need it. It’s so much easier when you don’t look for things to cut under duress. Write it down, so you can pull it out and see the plan you’ve made.

What small luxuries do you want to keep? What you can live without? The more you cut, the longer you can make savings last.

“Be ruthless,” Albrecht said. “You can always add in things if you feel you can’t live without them.”

Hello, DIY

Many people outsource practically everything, from housecleaning to yard work to delivery services, says Tara Koup, 43, a writer for QVC who lives in Paoli, Pennsylvania.

Koup says these practical skills are a top way to save.

In the pre-Covid-19 world, people turned to pros because they were busy and pressured.

But more time at home means less of an excuse to avoid learning to cook, clean, conserve, reuse.

“I use what is around me for free instead of purchasing,” Koup said. “Living simply is a good way to save money in the long run.”

They're easy to munch while holding a cocktail and they leave no dirty plates or utensils to clean up afterwards. Even better, you can please vegetarians and meat lovers alike without having to make two separate entrees.

The secret to a juicy, flavor-packed kabob is all in the marinade, which is prepped a day before, meaning less to do the day of a gathering. If you still haven’t found one that does the trick, don’t worry. This recipe from Andrea Correale, celebrity caterer and Founder of Elegant Affairs, is perfect for feeding a crowd in your own backyard or bringing along to a Memorial Day party this year.

“If you are using wood skewers make sure you soak them overnight first before putting the meat and veggies on them. Also make sure they are 12” skewers,” says Correale. “In order to get a good flavor, soak the meat and veggies for 24 hours before skewering.""

She also suggests using chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat for the most tender kabobs, and recommends always cooking them at about 350 degrees or medium heat. (If using a thermometer, meat should be 165 degrees.)

While the kabobs themselves are packed with flavor, Correale likes to serve them up with a few different dipping sauces as well, which makes the spread even more fun by letting your guests customize their meal with an extra pop of flavor. Some of her favorite pairings include:

Chimichurri

Chipotle aioli

Basil aioli

Basil pesto

Sundried tomato pesto

Red pepper relish

Lemon thyme vinaigrette

Hoisin or an Asian style sauce

And what about the rest of the spread? Correale serves her kabobs with grilled corn, corn salad or street corn, a potato salad or a farro or quinoa salad — or all three if you’re putting out a spread for a backyard party this season!

Now for the recipe. Simply toss all the ingredients together and add cubed chicken and/or veggies the night before, and you’ll be ready to thread on skewers and fire up the grill to feed your Memorial Day crowd.

Chicken Kabob Marinade

Yields 12 servings

Ingredients

1 cup oil

1 cup aged balsamic or sherry vinegar

½ cup low-sodium soy sauce

½ cup Worcestershire sauce

¼ cup lemon juice

1 ¼ cup brown sugar

4 tablespoons fresh rosemary

4 tablespoons Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons ground black pepper

4 teaspoons garlic powder

16 pieces of de-boned chicken thighs

To serve

Combine all ingredients in a freezer bag or in Pyrex dishes. Cover the kabobs well and put in the fridge to marinate for 12-24 hours. The next day they will be ready to thread onto skewers and grill.

When you're stuck at home all day, the line between snacks and meals is getting blurrier so it’s more important than ever to choose filling and nutritious options. Your best chance of getting through the day without distracting hunger is to choose a protein- and fiber-rich snack. Snacks that contain whole food sources of protein and fiber (say, from some combo of nuts, veggies, fruits, beans, eggs, or yogurt) offer a winning formula that keeps you full for hours. Plus, if your snack is dominant in protein- and fiber-rich food sources, these healthful ingredients are likely crowding out less healthful ones, namely added sugar and refined grains. Here are some pointers for picking a healthy, high protein, high fiber snack, along with some tasty options that fit the parameters.

What to look for in a healthy snack

At least 3 grams of fiber (you need around 25-38 grams per day)

5 or more grams of protein (for reference, a boiled egg has about 6 grams)

No more than 6 grams of added sugar (about 1 ½ teaspoons, but lower is better)

Wholesome ingredients, like beans, nuts, seeds, fruits, veggies, eggs, yogurt, and cheese

No artificial sweeteners, like sucralose or aspartame (the stuff in the yellow and blue packets)

No artificial colors or preservatives (often clues that something is overly processed)

Be 'calorie aware'

It’s not necessary to tether yourself to a calorie counting app, but it’s a good idea to be calorie aware and to energize (another way of saying consume calories) in line with your activity and needs. There’s a wide range of calorie needs, and your requirements may vary depending on the day (maybe you had a light lunch or maybe you participated in a killer workout or you might have a long stretch before dinner). Be realistic about your needs and goals. A good snack range is between 100 to 300 calories. Here are some ideas to get you off and running.

Healthy snacks at grocery store

In a pinch, you can find plenty of snacks that offer hunger-taming amounts of protein and fiber for grab-and-go eating.

You’ll score 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein in this restaurant style tortilla chip. The first ingredient is whole great northern beans, which provide the protein and fiber punch. Dip a serving of chips into some jarred, no added sugar salsa to boost the nutrition content while sticking close to the 130-calorie count from the chips.

Or, stash a a mini guac from Wholly Guacamole in your office fridge to pair the chips with some plant-based fats.

This is like string cheese’s sophisticated cousin, with a nutty, full-bodied flavor that happens to deliver 7 grams of protein per snack-size package. Pair it with a cup of strawberries to hit your fiber targets, or serve it with some grain and seed crackers, like these Mary’s Gone Crackers.

A bar made from whole food ingredients can tide you over in a pinch. These bars get protein from eggs and fiber from nuts, so they’re about the next best thing to a DIY snack. Each RXBAR has 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, and they’re sweetened with dates instead of added sugar. For a lighter snack that’s just as tasty and portable, their kiddie version supplies 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber for fewer calories.

A snack pack of almonds might be just what you need to get through a hangry afternoon. The 250-calorie snack-size portion supplies 5 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protein. You can pair the bag — either all of it or just half of it — with a fruit or veggie of your choice for a more balanced, protein- and fiber-rich snack.

Healthy snacks you can make at home

Lemon Tofu Creme over Strawberries Courtesy of Lauren Harris-Pincus

Love it or hate it, you can’t argue with tofu’s versatility. Here, it channels lemon crème sauce, yet it’s vegan, dairy- and gluten-free. Serve it atop strawberries (as shown) and you’ll get 5 grams of protein and fiber. Top with nuts and you’ll get even more of both nutrients.

Pumpkin Pie Smoothie Courtesy of Lauren Harris-Pincus

Smoothie shop smoothies can be a great way to amp up your fruit and veggie intake, but their calorie counts are often closer to a meal than a snack. If you have a blender handy, you can make this luscious treat, which has 9 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber for just 100 calories. And don’t forget about canned pumpkin once the weather warms. Pumpkin puree is an all-star staple that bumps up the nutrition in smoothies and other dishes.

Here's how to cope,"It turns out that ditching the commute and working from home in your sweats is not all it’s cracked up to be.

Juggling your work and home life, Zoom calls instead of in-person meetings and possibly parenting and home schooling kids, it’s no wonder Americans are exhausted.

In fact, in a recent Monster survey, 51% of respondents admitted to experiencing burnout while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Their home, which is normally a sanctuary and place to rest and relax with family, has instantly morphed into their office,” said Vicki Salemi, a Monster career expert.

That’s despite taking breaks for self-care throughout the day: 71% of those surveyed said they were stepping away from work for things like walks or spending time with family.

The culprit: a lack of structure and routine to your work day, Salemi said.

On top of that, we are isolated from those outside our immediate family, facing uncertainty about our health and the status of the virus, and parents are parenting all the time, added licensed psychologist Melissa L. Whitson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of New Haven in Connecticut.

There is also financial anxiety. While those working remotely still have a job, as opposed to the more than 30 million Americans who have filed unemployment claims since March, there is the threat that they, too, could lose their paycheck or have their salary cut at some point if the recession continues, she said.

“There is still that, ‘I need to work while I’m making money now and also to show that I am a good employee so they keep me on,’” Whitson said. “There is that added pressure onto it.”

‘Constantly on the verge of a panic attack’

Alana Acosta-Lahullier, 41, understands that feeling of burnout. With two children and a full-time job, she is exhausted all the time.

She helps with her the schooling of her 7-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son while she works from home full-time for an electrical contractor. Her son has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is on the autism spectrum, so he needs some extra help. Her husband works out of the home as a police officer.

“I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack,” said Acosta-Lahullier, who lives in Parsippany, New Jersey.

While her employer is very understanding, she feels the need to get everything done correctly.

“I find myself working all the time, even when I should be getting ready for bed,” Acosta-Lahullier said. “I feel an obligation to get everything done, even if it’s to the detriment of my own mental health.”

On top of that she has “mother’s guilt.”

“I need to make sure that everybody I have to take care of has everything they need,” she said. “I put this constant pressure on myself.”

‘Depressing monotony’

For 45-year-old David Hoffman, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and leads operations for a business unit of a large multinational company, the stress sometimes causes him to get “really short and snap.”

As the primary caregiver during the day to his three children, who are in first, third and sixth grade, he spends the day giving guidance on their various school assignments. He’s also trying to get his work done.

“Eight weeks of constant abnormal working and this heavy support and kids stuck in the house is stressful,” said Hoffman, whose wife has a full-time job in health-care administration at a local hospital.

He finds himself starting work earlier than he did while in the office, working later and doing more work at night after the kids have gone to bed in order to catch up.

“It’s just this monotony, this depressing monotony,” he said.

“It seems like it never ends. You go to sleep and you are right back at it.”

How to cope

The first thing you should do is to be kind to yourself and know that the stress manifests itself differently in different people, Whitson said.

You may be more angry or irritable, or you may appear to be more depressed or withdrawn. Recognize and accept that you may be experiencing any of these symptoms.

To help alleviate the stress, try to implement a routine and structure in your day-to-day life.

“When you are always on, your system gets overwhelmed and exhausted,” Whitson said.

Monster’s Salemi recommends waking up each morning as you would if you were commuting to your job. Get dressed and have breakfast. Put it on your calendar and create a routine around it, she said.

At the end of your normal workday, stop working and put your laptop out of sight.

If you are juggling kids’ school work and parenting, build that into your routine, as well. If you are able, work in a different room to do your job so that you can focus better. Trade off parenting duties with your partner, if possible.

Building a sense of community can also help, Whitson said. Make a point to have virtual meetings to connect with colleagues and online social gatherings with friends.

Not only can it increase your well-being, it can have “profound effects” on productivity and satisfaction in the workplace, she said.

Lastly, don’t be afraid to reach out for help from counselors or other support networks if you need it.

“We are all in this together,” Whitson said. “It is helpful to know that other people are in the same boat.

“Just find out what works for you and, if it’s not working, try something new,” she added. “It is not a one-size-fits-all.”"

Things like:

Do I have a clean mask to wear when I go shopping?

Is it safe to take my cats to the vet for their checkup?

What can we have for dinner that we can cook without running to the store?

How can I help my kids get ready to go back to school in the fall? What if they don’t go back?

These questions spin through my head, breaking my concentration during the day and waking me up at night. And I bet you have your own list of questions — big and small — running through your mind. All these decisions we need to make while we’re living through this pandemic are wearing us down. It’s overwhelming.

“These days even the smallest of decisions can stop us in our tracks,” says Melanie Ross Mills, a family relationship expert in Dallas.

This cognitive overload can lead to feelings of anxiety, irritability, stress and fatigue, according to Beth Darnall, Ph.D., associate professor and psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. “It requires adaptation to a level we haven’t experienced,” she says. “The most overused word with COVID is ‘unprecedented,’ but we don’t have a template for this level of cognitive overload.”

We can’t just go back to our old ways of doing things. But we can find ways to decrease the number of decisions we have to make. Here’s what the experts say.

Set up routines

When we have systems in place, we can eliminate some of the burden of making decisions. We make the decisions once, and then they run on autopilot. Susan Bernstein, a licensed social worker in Connecticut and Massachusetts and an adjunct faculty member at Boston University, says it’s helpful for us to automate as many decisions as possible now, because as areas start reopening, we’ll be faced with new rounds of decisions.

We can make it routine to:

Wash our masks as soon as we get home, and leave clean masks by the door.

Choose a day to go to the stores and batch our errands to minimize our trips out of the house.

Keep a running grocery list.

Pick a date for grocery deliveries. For example, Bernstein discovered she can reserve a Costco Instacart delivery two weeks in advance, and then add items to her cart before the delivery date.

Set a day for house cleaning. “A clean house makes a lot of people feel better,” Bernstein says. “It resets the energy in the home.”

Run the dishwasher at night so the dishes are clean in the morning.

Schedule alone time for each family member, even if that means “signing out” a room for 30 minutes or an hour.

Make lists

When we sit down and organize our thoughts, everything starts to settle, and we can make fewer decisions.

“I’m a big fan of writing everything down,” Bernstein says. That’s because information that’s swamping our brains can cause unnecessary distress. When you write something down, you have one less thing to fret about. “We can save our energy for important things like safety and maintaining our balance and our family’s balance,” she says.

Plus, it’s satisfying to cross things off our lists. “It’s always so nice to take that pen or dry erase marker and put a line through something,” Bernstein says.

Build in margins

These days, a lot of us are rushing through every minute. We’re tackling work projects, helping children with schoolwork, keeping our households running smoothly and caring for at-risk relatives.

It might be a challenge but taking a few minutes to stave off the feeling of being overwhelmed is important. “Leave space within your physical day, as well as in your mental state, so that you have enough bandwidth and energy to clearly make effective, productive, healthy decisions for yourself and those around you,” Mills says.

Factor in rewards

“In the middle of all this decision distress, where do you get a reward?” Bernstein asks. She likes the idea of routine nights when you order takeout or delivery. “If Thursday is dinner delivery day, that’s one less thing you have to ponder over, and you’re supporting a local restaurant — that’s a win-win,” she says.

Decide not to decide

When things are out of our control, we’re not deciding, we’re just worrying. We don’t know when our workplaces, schools, and shops will open, and we don’t know what those places will look like when they do. It’s frustrating — as humans, we don’t like uncertainty — but as much as we can, we need to try not to let our worries drain our mental energy.

Let it go once you decide

You’ve made your choice. Now don’t rethink it. “A lot of people have buyer’s remorse,” Bernstein says. “If you’re buying $200 worth of board games so your family functions in a happier state, that’s a good thing.”"
199,2020-05-18 13:38:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/many-americans-are-unaware-coronavirus-related-financial-assistance-s-available-ncna1209181,Many Americans are unaware of the coronavirus-related financial assistance that's available to them,"Many unemployed people may not be aware of the coronavirus-related financial assistance that is available to them.

A whopping 80 percent of unemployed Americans say they haven’t reached out for relief measures, according to Credit Karma.

They think they don’t qualify. They’re overwhelmed by all the information. They don’t even know where to start.

These are the top reasons for not accessing assistance, according to the financial advice website, which surveyed 1,037 U.S. adults in April about their understanding of government relief measures related to COVID-19.

The stimulus checks are the top story, but you may be able to access other types of relief. Here’s what else you may qualify for.

You may qualify for paid leave

Qualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

Valid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut.

If you’re caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.

Help with utility bills

Many utility companies — including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others — have suspended service disconnections.

You may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development’s COVID-19 resources. Your state’s website may help. Some are stopping utility companies from shutting off services.

Sign up for insurance

If you lost your job and need health insurance, some states are holding special ACA open enrollments. AARP keeps an updated list of extensions on state health exchanges.

Uninsured people in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York and Vermont can enroll for health insurance through their state exchanges through June 15. California is allowing state residents to enroll through June 30.

Find out if you qualify for Medicaid by inputting your state, family size and income level on the Healthcare.gov calculator.

Rent relief

The CARES Act has aid for homeowners who are struggling with their federally backed mortgage payments but renters also have some help.

Many states and cities have put a stop order on evictions. New York, for instance, has a 90-day eviction ban. A Columbia Law School professor frequently updates this list of state actions.

Tax postponement

The federal government has pushed the filing and payment deadline for 2019 income taxes to at least July 15 — and it could be as late as September.

You have time not only to do the paperwork but to come up with the money if you owe taxes. Many states have also delayed filing and payment, but not all. Check with your state or the American Institute of CPAs, which keeps an updated list."
200,2020-05-15 21:39:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-not-be-coronavirus-jerk-during-pandemic-ncna1207926,How to not be a 'coronavirus jerk' during the pandemic,"Life as an immune-compromised person under quarantine in New York City has been stressful, to say the least. Families in crowded apartment buildings stacked on top of each other, all the stores have narrow aisles, and there are people everywhere — even though we’ve been asked to stay home to stop the spread. Many are willing to adapt to our new normal, but there are just as many refusing to stay home, wear masks or respect the 6-foot distance rule.

According to the Mayo Clinic, stress can bring on anxiety, sadness, a feeling of being overwhelmed, irritability and anger. These feelings can ooze out of us in different ways, says Sanam Hafeez, a clinical psychologist based in New York City. “The stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in a magnitude that we have not seen until now. While we do see courage and kindness, we also see people who act out in an aggressive, offensive or inappropriate manner, both in-person and online,” she says.

Andrea Bonior, a licensed clinical psychologist in Bethesda, Maryland, host of ""Baggage Check,"" a live chat and column with ""The Washington Post,"" says living under the “chronic, constant threat” of COVID-19 does a number on our peripheral nervous systems, causing some to act out. “It can make us more irritable, or more self-serving — ‘I'm not going to wear a mask. They're uncomfortable, and if I get sick, I get sick.’ This hijacks our decision-making process and makes us less thoughtful in our actions, which easily causes conflict with others,” she explains.

It’s no wonder corona-jerky behavior abounds. We asked Bonior and Hafeez to help define those behaviors and give their tips for how to avoid them.

At the grocery store

As nerve-wracking as grocery shopping is right now, both experts stress the importance of treating your fellow shoppers the way you’d like to be treated. “It's a crucial time for the classic question: ‘If everyone behaved like I am right now, would it be a good thing or a bad thing?’” says Bonior. “If someone isn't showing you space, give them kindness in terms of tone, but be firm in your own boundary.”

“Respect for personal space is being self-aware,” says Hafeez. “People are scared right now. If they are in a grocery store it’s out of necessity, so giving people space, wearing a mask and practicing general prevention etiquette can go a long way.” When it’s time to check out, remember the cashiers are putting themselves at risk so you can eat, so treat them with kindness. “Practice patience and never berate or humiliate anyone,” Hafeez says. And remember — a simple ‘thank you’ can go a long way.

Online

With so many working from home and craving water-cooler conversation, social media channels are rampant with COVID-fueled aggressive or passive-aggressive behavior. “It’s one thing to debate, but be kind and leave out personal attacks,” Bonior advises. “It's really a matter of tone. If you feel the need to correct someone, do it in an empathetic way with as much respect and as little condescension as you can muster. Sometimes, that means doing it privately.”

While jogging or taking a walk outside

Though exercise can alleviate stress, do it in a way that considers the health of others. “Social distance is of paramount importance — even outside in the fresh air,” says Hafeez. “If you’re jogging towards a walker, keep a healthy distance as you jog past. When we jog we breathe faster, sometimes through our mouths, and we could be sweating and huffing and puffing.”

“We simply don't have the right to put other people at significant risk for our own convenience,” says Bonior. “Give others the right of way. There's likely nowhere that you are actually rushing to when you are outside at this point. If you can't do it for others, think about your own exposure instead.”

In an apartment building

COVID-compliant etiquette is vital in shared spaces, like apartment buildings. “The responsible thing to do is to stay home and avoid having people visit,” says Hafeez. “Take precautions for your neighbors and yourself, like disposing of gloves correctly — not leaving them on the floor in an elevator — and make sure you wear a protective layer over your nose and mouth.”

“Having people visit” includes anyone who works for you in your home. “If your own income isn’t in jeopardy, I strongly believe it's the right thing to do to keep paying domestic workers who rely on that income — even if they can’t work,” says Bonior. “Making them work puts them at risk.”

At work

Whether you’re working from home or are an essential worker on the front lines, patience and consideration are key. “If you have to share a lunchroom, make cleanliness, organization and safety the center of your every decision,” says Hafeez. “Don't leave used utensils on a counter, wash your hands when using communal equipment and if you feel sick or have come into contact with someone who is sick, stay home.”

Bonior says those on continuous conference calls at home should be understanding of those with children, or who have dogs that bark. “It's easy to be accidentally disruptive,"" she says. ""If your coworker does something embarrassing, don't be the person who makes it go viral.” On the other hand, if it's your own child or dog that disrupts the call, Bonior suggest you ""take responsibility, make a simple but heartfelt apology, then try your best to move on.”

At home

When cooped-up in close quarters with others, tensions can build easily. Hafeez says you can avoid being a jerk by displaying some consideration. “Take care of a task without being asked, help prepare food and maintain precautions, such as coughing into your elbows, covering your mouth and washing your hands religiously and correctly,” she says.

Bonior adds that, as close as your family may be under normal circumstances, everyone needs emotional space once in a while. “Let them have their privacy — don't bring them into work calls or post constantly about them on social media if they aren't truly OK with it,” she says.

In your community

Calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” set off a rash of abominable behavior, including horrible acts of bigotry and racism against the Asian community. “Racism and bigotry are unacceptable,” says Hafeez. “Mocking or attacking a person of Asian descent will not cure this pandemic, and it won't make us feel any better.”

There are some options for responding to a racist incident. For example, if you feel it's safe to intervene, you can take a stand and offer your support to the victim. You can also report the incident to the police. “Fear can bring out the worst in some people. But it can motivate us to look out for each other and realize that we’re all in this world together. That can be a bright spot in all of this pain,” Bonior says.

Ultimately, to avoid being jerk, err on the side of empathy. “Understand that, just as scared as you are, there are millions of people out there who are struggling as well. We can all be mindful and respectful of others' views and space, and make a commitment to act more calmly and with empathy, [rather] than minimize the stress and struggles of others,” says Hafeez.

Finally, if you know someone suffering from COVID-19 — directly or indirectly — reach out. “Almost all of us are feeling more alone than normal, but those who have been touched by grief and loss, or the threat of a sick family member, are feeling alone-ness more acutely and need support more than ever,” Bonior says."
201,2020-05-15 21:24:00+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/grocery-prices-are-rise-here-are-6-ways-keep-your-ncna1207896,Grocery prices are on the rise — here are 6 ways to keep your food budget under control,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, shoppers have had to contend with higher prices on many common food items, including meat, milk and eggs. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that consumers paid 2.6% more for groceries in April than in March — the largest one month increase since February 1974.

The price of meat, poultry, fish and eggs rose 4.3%, cereals and bakery products jumped 2.9%, and fruits, vegetables and dairy goods all gained 1.5%. The price index for eggs alone climbed just over 16% — the biggest increase for any single food.

Shoppers shouldn’t expect prices to fall as states reopen. “I think this is the new normal for a while,” says Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru.

That’s because everyone — from farmers to producers to processing plants to grocery stores — is going to have to make huge investments in personnel and product safety. On the farm and food processing side of things, there will need to be worker social distancing protocols put in place. Meanwhile, supermarkets are already investing in increased sanitation procedures, plexiglass barriers to protect checkout employees and additional staff and security guards to limit customer capacity in stores.

“Prices are going to continue to go up for a while,” Lempert says. “It’s probably two to three years until we can have a more efficient supply chain and then they can be reduced.”

But that doesn’t mean that the prices on all groceries are going to skyrocket or that you won’t be able to find deals. You’ll just need to be careful and creative.

Here are six ways to keep your food budget low while on lockdown, according to experts.

1. Shop around

If you typically do most of your food shopping at the local grocery chain, it may be worth looking at other stores where you wouldn’t normally go, Lempert says. That includes budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl. Part of the secret to these stores’ low prices is that the vast majority of their products are private label, so you’re not paying for the marketing and advertising that many brands use to attract customers.

In fact, CNBC Make It previously found that Aldi offered cheaper prices on more essential products than even Walmart. Dollar stores and grocery outlet stores may also offer better prices, Lempert adds.

Restaurants may also be a good place to find groceries right now. Panera got into the grocery delivery game, allowing customers to order groceries such as milk, bread and fresh produce like tomatoes and grapes alongside their favorite salads, soups and sandwiches. “It’s worth looking at different places to acquire food,” Lempert says.

2. Shop local

With the weather in many parts of the country starting to warm up and many of the stay-at-home orders ending, expect farmer’s markets and community supported agriculture (CSA) programs to re-start. When they do, those may be great resources for shoppers looking for more variety at relatively stable prices, Lempert says.

“There may be a better selection as CSAs could be less impacted by some shortages,” says Veronica Lehman, part of the emerging brands team at food and beverage consulting group JPG Resources.

Additionally, shoppers should check out farms in their area. “We’re now seeing a lot of farmers selling direct to consumers,” Lempert says. Smaller meat processors who have not been affected by coronavirus are also selling direct, he adds.

“Farmers have really been hit hard with this,”Lempert says. Many are innovating to find ways to get their produce and products to consumers by partnering with local grocery stores or setting up online shopping and delivery options.

3. Buy private labels

If you’re looking to cut costs, shop the store’s own brand, Lempert suggests. It’s almost always cheaper than national name brand products by 20% to 30% on average, he says.

You won’t lose out on quality. In the 2019 Private Label Manufacturers Association (PLMA) annual report, two-thirds of consumers agreed with the statement: “In general, store brand products I have bought are just as good, if not better than the national version of the same products.”

4. Pick up frozen first

While the price of meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 4.3% in April, the cost of frozen varieties of those same products has remained more stable, Lempert says. “You’re going to see less price increases there, especially on the meat, beef, chicken type of products,” he adds.

Shoppers don’t need to stress about finding these products as much now as at the beginning of the pandemic when many Americans were stocking up on supplies. “I know a lot of frozen food cases were decimated for the past couple of weeks, but for the most part, they’ve now been restocked into almost full,” Lempert says.

5. Pay attention to ingredients

The prices on some pantry staples may be stable now, but the ability to keep those prices consistent in the coming months will depend on their ingredients, Lempert says. Take boxed macaroni and cheese. It has milk as a major ingredient, so it’s more likely to have a price increase than a wild rice mix because the price of dairy products are already up 1.5%.

That said, price increases on shelf-stable items are going to happen slower because they’ve been stored more in warehouses and the increased costs of raw materials haven’t hit the products on the shelves just yet.

“We have not seen price increases across the board,” Lehman says. “It’s mainly just in items that may be vulnerable to inventory shortages.” That’s the case for meat, which is a far more concentrated industry compared to other sectors. There’s only a handful of brands and suppliers in the meat department of your local retailer, but there are a ton of snack food companies, so you likely won’t see price spikes on those items yet.

While it’s a good idea to continue to purchase self-stable products right now, start to pay more attention to prices on products that contain ingredients that may have had more challenges during the pandemic.

6. Avoid prepared foods

If you’re looking to trim your food budget, it’s worth considering making everything from scratch and skipping prepared foods or meals that come from a box, Lehman says. Not only are these generally more expensive, but the company making the meal may soon start passing on the higher raw ingredient costs.

“Buying fewer prepared foods and more ingredients to cook meals from scratch is cost effective,” Lehman says. Think about purchasing pasta, ground beef, tomato and spices separately instead of picking up a boxed pasta meal.

At the end of the day, economic forces around supply and demand are driving most of the price increases we are seeing, Lehman says. “Some retail demand, while related to fear, is the result of living with these unfamiliar patterns,” she says.

Plus, many consumers are still adjusting to cooking more meals at home. As a result, consumers are not sure how much food to keep on hand for daily meals and how long things last. “They’re just beginning to getting a real sense of what’s needed and how far they can be stretched,” Lehman says. As we all adjust, that will also help prices and supplies stabilize."
202,2020-05-15 21:15:38+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/cauliflower-tater-tots-4-other-recipes-use-head-cauliflower-ncna1138576,"Healthy cauliflower recipes: tater tots, cauliflower steaks and more","There is no question that cauliflower has been having a long, popular moment. I was already a cauliflower fan, actually a cauliflower lover, mostly in the form of sliced and broken chunks of cauliflower tossed with a generous amount of olive oil, sprinkled with a liberal amount of salt, and roasted to a deep caramelized brown in a fairly high oven. My family can eat a baking sheet of that before dinner even hits the table.

And geez, once people started realized you could “rice” it — eg, chop it into tiny rice-sized pieces — it blossomed into a true “thing”. It can be used in stir fries, pizza crusts, meatloaves — anywhere regular rice can make an appearance, you might find cauliflower edging its way in. And then the whole mashed cauliflower thing — another game changer. And there are entire frozen food lines based on cauliflower flooding the market, in particular things topping or encased in cauliflower crusts. Kale who, right?

But you don’t have to just eat cauliflower in the form of rice-shaped bits or in packaged goods. You can bring home a head or two and make many delicious dishes featuring this versatile vegetable, without a whole lot of fuss. And believe me, I’ll be making these recipes this month, and long into the future, whether cauliflower is still “hot”, or not.

And here are 5 cauliflower recipes to add to your meal rotation:

Cheyenne Cohen

Cauliflower steaks may be trendy and they may be a little silly to order in a restaurant (12 bucks for a slab of cauliflower? Not unless you really, really want one), but they are NOT silly to make at home. Not at all. They are satisfying and hearty, and the way the edges caramelize is pure deliciousness. If you love chicken wings, but can't justify them as part of the regular rotation OR if you're a vegetarian missing buffalo wings, this is for you.

Cheyenne Cohen

Chimichurri is basically the national sauce of Argentina, and so easy to make at home. It’s vibrant with loads of fresh parsley and has a nice level of garlickiness and a bit of tanginess from a splash of vinegar, or sometimes lemon juice. This turns roasted cauliflower into something special.

Cheyenne Cohen

Ok, this is a trendy one, sure, but it’s just so much fun. And if you are a parent who needs to find clever ways to get your kids to engage with vegetables, you probably can’t beat this presentation. Caulitots look and even taste amazingly like classic potato-based tater tots, but they are made of cooked, chopped cauliflower mixed with some cheese (because of course), egg and breadcrumbs and then shaped into appealing little cylinders and baked. Your kids may become card carrying members of the Cauliflower Fan Club, thanks to these nuggets. Also, they are kind of cool to make, so enlist their help!

Cheyenne Cohen

This vegan salad will make you feel happy making it, happy serving it, and even happier eating it. Nuggets of roasted cauliflower add depth of flavor and toastiness to a crunchy romaine salad studded with chickpeas. The lemon tahini dressing easily partners with the chickpeas — collectively they are basically the ingredients in traditional hummus. The dressing is quite thick, almost mayonnaise-like in texture. At first you’ll basically dollop it on, but then when you toss the vegetables and lettuce with the dressing it will coat everything with creaminess. A shower of thinly sliced red onion is the kicker, plus some herby brightness from cilantro or parsley.

Katie Workman

This beautiful and hearty soup lays no claims to culinary authenticity but incorporates some of the spices that most often appear in Moroccan cuisine (cumin, ground ginger, cayenne and coriander). If you want it even spicier, you might swirl in a spoonful or two of harissa, which is a North African chili paste, at the very end. If you want the soup to be vegan, use vegetable broth, and skip the small amount of sour cream for serving.

While most of us may not be able to pick up a little place in Paris (or even go to Paris at this point), here’s one dream of a place we can take inspiration from.

I spent a few nights at a vacation rental in Paris’ 12th arrondissement last fall, and had to tear myself away each day because my husband and I wanted to stay and soak up the elegance and grandeur of the apartment. While, incredibly, the space was only 430 square feet, it was perfectly proportioned and designed for not only life on vacation, but at home.

Whether through serendipity or algorithms, I found a blog post after the trip about the apartment’s gut renovation and remarkable transformation to the space we’d enjoyed. And happily, the owner was willing to share her best tips for creating the ultimate little Paris apartment — tips any of us can use wherever we live.

U.S. expat Kathryn Brown is the director of operations and client services for Paris Property Group, a firm that helps international clients buy or sell real estate in Paris. The apartment is her permanent residence, but local law allows a home to be rented short term for up to 120 days per year. She makes it available through Paris Perfect, which is where we rented it.

From breaking design rules to engineering for your life, here are Brown’s tips for designing a glamorous — and livable — small space.

Rethink everything

Just because a hallway is long doesn’t mean it has to stay that way. Bathroom on the left and kitchen on the right? Who says they can’t swap? Unused space in the bedroom and the living room is cramped? Move that wall! Window in the way of a shower? Cover it!

While the apartment was perfectly charming, at least in looking at the ‘before’ photos, it wasn’t functional or elegant. Brown didn’t assume anything had to stay the way it was, and so, aside from keeping structurally necessary walls, she rethought everything.

Design for your life

You don’t have to be an interior designer to create a beautiful space. Just think about how you’ll use it.

“I don’t have any design background,” said Brown. “I’m a sales and marketing type person. The decisions that I made about the apartment were based on how I wanted to live in it.”

So while she considered removing the wall between the bedroom and the living room to make the apartment a studio, she said, when friends and family visit, “then you’re listening to each other snore. It would be weird, we’d be in the same room and that’s not very grown up.”

The layout, which equally divided the bedroom and living room with a windowed wall dressed in heavy curtains meant the couch had to sit on the opposite wall. It was oppressive, Brown said.

So she calculated how much storage she needed (and vastly pared down her wardrobe) and sized the bedroom around a new wall of built-in closets, moving the old dividing wall in to allow just enough room to walk around the bed (which hides storage beneath!).

In the sliver of a half bath, she had storage and shelving built precisely to fit things like her ladder and AC unit, which are stowed out of sight without a centimeter of wasted space.

You can go glam in a small space

The space Brown carved out of the bedroom made the living room spacious enough for a “majestic” fireplace focal point. Then she turned to the ceilings, a 1930s rounded, cove style decorated with a bit of trim. Working with a craftsman, “we flanked it on both sides with a little bit more impressive trim and it makes the whole thing look like crown molding,” she said.

Conventional wisdom might say you need small furniture in a small space, but Brown bucked that with a big, comfy (though stylish) couch, a large, ornate armoire that holds the TV and serves as storage, plus a weighty cocktail table and a half-round side table that serves as a desk. A large, luxe, gilt-framed mirror on the mantle and glittering chandelier complete the scene.

Brown didn't think a small space deserved small furnishings. This large, luxe, gilt-framed mirror on the mantle makes the room feel bigger.

Flex the space

There’s no dining room in the diminutive apartment, so Brown makes clever use of the living room. When she hosts a cocktail party for 30(!) or even Thanksgiving dinner, she sets the cocktail table on its side in the hall (or even relocates it to the elevator vestibule outside the apartment) and expands the half-round table with a leaf secreted behind the armoire and moves it under the chandelier. Et voila, a dining table for eight in less than five minutes. Some diners take chairs, others the couch, because who says you need eight dining room chairs for the occasional party?

Let there be light — but sacrifice it when you have to

Brown added a pocket door to the new wall between the bedroom and living room, and mirrored each side of the door. While it wasn’t intentional, it turned out to be “dumb luck,” she said, that the door reflected the floor to nearly ceiling windows that lined each room. With light everywhere, and the age-old trick of adding reflections, both spaces feel larger, brighter, and airier.

Meanwhile in the new bathroom, a trading-spaces floor plan swap with the former kitchen, she was left with the dilemma of a window in the shower. Giving up a window is a tough call, but there was still another one in the room, so she opted to cover it to allow for a more streamlined shower wall.

Consider your palette

Brown mixed patterns, colors, and textures throughout the apartment’s flooring — a no-no by most rulebooks when you’re trying to make a small space seem bigger. Each piece is harmonious with the others, and creates a personality and sense of discovery in each room. It succeeds thanks to a carefully selected palette throughout.

“Basically it’s black, white, gray, and cream,” she said. “It’s a neutral palette and the idea is I can layer on whatever accessory I want.” Like the chartreuse, silk-look curtains that have accompanied her to every apartment she’s had in 20 years in Paris.

Of course we know there are infinite shades of white. For the white walls Brown chose a shade that hewed warm and yellow, Farrow & Ball Pointing, to combat the blue/gray tones so prevalent in the light and skies over Paris.

“The place just feels good to me,” she said. “It feels warm.” It’s also versatile. “I wanted enough of a neutral palette that if I wanted blue and purple or red and pink accents it could go either way.”

Streamline where it makes sense — and adapt when you have to

While she played with patterns and textures throughout the flooring, in the narrow galley kitchen Brown kept to a soothing gray wall of cabinetry with even most of the appliances hidden behind panels. The expanse of gray makes the decadent Lacanche stove pop even more. The kitchen, now housed where the bathroom previously was, snagged additional space from the too-long entry hall, allowing room for a dishwasher and a clothes washing machine.

A clothes dryer found its home in the bathroom just a few steps away. It’s unconventional to split them, yes, but a dryer is a luxury in a Paris apartment wherever it lives, so breaking the pair up was worth it.

Choose good bones

Of course all of this was made possible by the good bones of the apartment. Brown bought it foremost because it was what she could afford. But the apartment boasted windows on three sides, and outside space on the balcony that would allow her to have window boxes and greenery. She also loved the location, and the dreamy rooftop views.

While it’s a ways out from the more touristed, central zones of Paris, the apartment sits in a lovely location with a metro line nearby, a popular market around the corner, and an elevated walkway, the Promenade Plantée, just down the street.

The affordable (by Paris standards) price for the cute but less-than-functional, and dated apartment allowed Brown to really invest in upgrades. And she went out on a limb with the purchase and remodel, funding it herself after her financing fell through at the last minute. Seeing the potential of the place though, “sometimes you just have to take a leap,” she said, “and have faith that it will work out.”
