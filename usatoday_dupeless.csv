The numbers on this page are based on the latest statistics available, which are likely far lower than the actual number of cases due to limited testing across the country. More than nine million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and over 200,000 have died in the U.S. Here's the situation as it stands:

The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 each day plateaued after reaching a peak in late April, but in recent weeks, there has been a new surge of cases across the country.

New deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19 by day

While New York has seen the largest number of cumulative cases of any state, more recently the spread of the disease has slowed there and accelerated in other states, such as California, Texas, Arizona and Florida. Toggle the map below between cumulative totals and data from the last seven days to get a complete picture of where the virus is spreading.

Some states that are experiencing rapid growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases are not among those that experienced large outbreaks earlier in the year. Here are the states where case numbers grew the fastest during the past seven days compared to the preceding week:

Each state has declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency, and many have implemented restrictions on travel, business and public gatherings. All states have begun easing or lifting those restrictions, despite the fact that case trends are on the rise in many places.

The spread of the disease in the U.S. exhibited exponential growth during the early weeks of the pandemic, the nation became the epicenter of the global pandemic, and case totals eclipsed those of other countries experiencing similar outbreaks.

A note on data:

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them. Finally, local governments and other organizations count and update case data differently, meaning different sources of information may show different numbers of cases.

Sometimes, data sources or formats change unexpectedly, leading to temporary inaccuracies in county-level data. We fix these as soon as possible. However, if you see a problem let us know at coronavirusdata@usatoday.com.

Don't have Netflix?The 50 best TV shows to watch on Hulu right now

1. “Alias Grace”

Starring Sarah Gadon and Anna Paquin, this dizzyingly beautiful adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s novel about a historical murderess is haunting in its storytelling. The miniseries far outpaces, in both style and substance, the more famous Atwood adaptation on Hulu.

2. “American Crime Story”

Between “The People v. O.J. Simpson” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” Ryan Murphy’s true-crime anthology has delivered narratives that lack the seedy exploitation so often associated with the genre. Instead, each season is a historical reckoning with huge cultural moments, portrayed with impeccable acting and writing.

3. “American Vandal”

A hilarious mockumentary poking at true-crime documentaries like Netflix’s own “Making a Murderer,” this series treats teen problems with the gravitas of a murder investigation. And considering most emotions and dramas feel like life or death in adolescence, “Vandal” is deeply moving in how it brings high school to life.

4. “Avatar: The Last Airbender” and ""The Legend of Korra""

A Nickelodeon animated series with a devoted adult following, “Airbender” is a fantasy epic in kid's clothing with drama to rival “Game of Thrones.” The gorgeously drawn series takes place in a world torn apart by war and genocide, where a pint-size chosen one might be able to save lives, if he can train hard enough and face his greatest fears. A follow up series set a generation in the future and aimed at an older audience, ""Korra,"" surpasses its source material in maturity and storytelling complexity, becoming a modern classic.

5. “Better Call Saul”

A rare spin-off to outpace its source material in quality and complexity, Bob Odenkirk’s “Breaking Bad” prequel continues to reach new heights in every season, and has long since stepped out of its parent show’s shadow.

The full list:Everything coming to Netflix in November 2020, and what's leaving

6. “Blown Away”

Netflix’s little reality series about competitive glass blowing is mesmerizing to watch, as its highly talented contestants stretch molten materials into stunning works of art. Breezy, funny and surprising, it’s a supremely satisfying series to binge-watch.

7. “BoJack Horseman”

A misanthropic Hollywood horse (Will Arnett) leads this animated satire series that is deeper, more clever and more thought-provoking than most live-action series even aspire to be.

8. “Call the Midwife”

This British period drama, set among nurse midwives serving poor families in 1950s London, is like an epidural injecting joy, tears and adorable babies into your life. Although it gets a little repetitive in later seasons, its raw emotion and British sensibility make it a must-watch for the “Downton Abbey” crowd.

9. “Cheers”

Sometimes you just want to go where everybody knows your name, even if you’re staying at home. The classic Boston bar-set sitcom still holds up after all these years.

10. ""Cobra Kai""

The fantastic revival of ""The Karate Kid"" franchise, featuring, Ralph Macchio and William Zabka in their original roles, is one of the smartest ways to bring a kids' story into adulthood. It picks up three decades after the All Valley Karate Tournament, as Zabka's Johnny Lawrence a gentler hero and Macchio's Daniel LaRusso playing the villain.

11. “Community”

Wacky, weird and often wonderful, NBC’s comedy about a diverse group of friends at a community college defies genre and label in its first few excellent seasons to create engrossing television. The later seasons are fine, but never as good as the first three.

12. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend""

A magnificent melange of musical might, the four-season CW series ambitiously put original song and dance on network TV week after week. Anchored by creator/star Rachel Bloom as struggling heroine Rebecca Bunch, “Crazy Ex” mixed earworms with one of the best depictions of a mental health journey ever on TV.

13. “The Crown”

For devoted anglophiles and royal rejecters alike, Netflix’s dramatization of the reign of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II makes a juicy soap out of the royal family, in a prestigious, Emmy-winning package. Season 4 (streaming Nov. 15) introduces Princess Diana (Emma Corrin), Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and a lot more drama to the Windsors.

14. ""Dawson's Creek""

James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson have very different careers now, but from 1998-2003 they made the youth of America swoon and sigh. This seminal WB teen drama, about a close-knit group of high school friends in a fictional Massachusetts town, was expert at turning crushes, chemistry and heartbreak into must-watch drama.

15. ""Deaf U""

This smart, addictive new reality series follows college kids at Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition to illuminating the deaf and hard of hearing community, the show is incredible at creating relationship drama and comedy out of the lives of the students it follows, and has the rare reality ensemble that pops off the screen with charm.

16. “Dear White People”

Stronger and more self-assured than the movie on which it’s based, this series, about Black students at an elite university full of microaggressions and outright racism, “Dear” is whip-smart and often hilarious.

17. “Derry Girls”

You may have to watch with subtitles to parse the strong Irish accents, but this series about Catholic teen girls in Northern Ireland during the 1990s portion of the “Troubles,” the violent religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, is one of the funniest shows on TV, even for Americans unfamiliar with the history.

18. ""Evil""

""The Good Wife"" and ""The Good Fight"" creators Robert and Michelle King bring their cutting dialogue and timely stories to this superb CBS series, which arrives on Netflix Oct. 1. ""Evil"" follows a psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a tech specialist (Aasif Mandvi) as they investigate alleged demon possessions, miracles and other phenomenon. How much evil is really out there?

19. ""Girlfriends""

Tracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White and Jill Marie Jones anchored this hilarious and affecting 2000-2008 UPN sitcom about the love lives and friendships of four Black women in Los Angeles.

20. “The Good Place”

NBC's recently ended afterlife sitcom feels like a dose of palliative care with its bright colors, puns and visual gags. Underneath its appealing aesthetics, ""Place"" has great performances, great writing and some sincere thoughts about ethics and philosophy. (Season 4 available Sept. 26.)

21. “Grace and Frankie”

Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are a magnetic duo in this sitcom from the “Friends” creators. The actresses play the eponymous retirees who learn their husbands are leaving them (for each other). The sometimes raunchy series proves it’s never too late to start over.

22. “The Great British Baking Show”

Warm, friendly, full of soggy bottoms, underproved loaves and decent people doing their best, this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made. Don’t miss one of the early seasons (which aired in 2012 in the U.K.), which is billed separately from the rest on Netflix under the title “The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings.”

23. “Grey’s Anatomy”

Shonda Rhimes' seminal hospital drama is still on the air after 16 seasons for a reason. Sure, the series crossed over from soapy to full-on soap opera early in its tenure, but amid its constant barrage of tragedy and medical grotesquery are compelling relationship dramas that are emotionally honest.

24. “Halt and Catch Fire”

This short but impactful drama started as a “Mad Men” knockoff about the 1980s computer industry, but greatly improved on a so-so first season. “Halt” evolved into a complex story about communication, connection and women's struggles to achieve power at home and work.

25. “Jane the Virgin”

The telenovela-style story of a virgin who's artificially inseminated by accident started strong and rode high for five excellent seasons. Although the moving series isn't a laugh-out-loud sitcom, its moments of joy and levity are plentiful.

26. Ken Burns documentaries

This one is a cheat, because there are just so many great documentaries from the legendary filmmaker. But if you want to be educated, entertained and potentially shocked all at once, try some of the great ones available on Netflix: “Prohibition,” “The Civil War,” “The West” and “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History.”

27. “Lovesick”

If you like a sweet (but not too saccharine) romantic comedy, this short British series is a good choice. The story starts with a man diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease reaching out to his former flames, and morphs into a touching and surprising will they/won’t they love story.

28. “The Magicians”

Like an R-rated mashup of “Game of Thrones,” ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" the superb fantasy series follows a group of adult magicians who discover a fictional world from popular children's books is real – and deathly dangerous.

29. “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”

There are comedy classics, and then there are the genre’s very foundations. If you are a fan of “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” but have never seen the hysterical, groundbreaking sketch TV show from comedians Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin that came first, now is the time to correct that error.

30. “Never Have I Ever”

Mindy Kaling's teen sitcom is a breath of honest, awkward fresh air. Loosely based on Kaling's experiences, the series follows Devi (sparkling new talent Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), an Indian American teen fumbling her way through an angry, frustrating adolescence.

31. “Nurse Jackie”

After years of excellent supporting work on “The Sopranos,” Edie Falco got her own star vehicle in Showtime’s “Jackie,” which follows a New York City nurse dedicated to helping patients no matter the cost. She also happens to be addicted to painkillers and cheating on her husband. It’s complicated.

32. “The Office”

There is just no getting sick of the ultimate workplace sitcom, no matter how many times you watch Michael Scott (Steve Carell) burn his foot on a George Foreman grill. Enjoy it on Netflix before it jumps to NBCUniversal’s new Peacock streaming service in 2021.

33. “Orange Is the New Black”

Netflix’s groundbreaking series had ups and downs over its run, but especially its first three seasons are exquisite character portraits in a space we’ve rarely seen: The inside of a women’s prison.

34. “One Day at a Time”

Like Norman Lear's original, which premiered in 1975, this family sitcom reboot, about a Cuban American family in Los Angeles, is expert at combining frank discussion of social issues with hilarity. The most recent season of the series jumped from Netflix to cable channel PopTV, but the first three wonderful years are still streaming on their original home.

35. “Person of Interest”

“POI” follows a billionaire and an ex-CIA operative who use the government’s surveillance system to protect ordinary people from crimes that haven’t yet happened. Eventually it turns to straight-up science fiction about artificial intelligence. It’s the kind of mindless-but-really-thoughtful crime procedural you sometimes crave.

36. “Pose”

The LGBTQ drama, set in 1980s ballroom culture, is ambitious, tragic and complex. It’s gorgeously filmed with especially strong performances from Emmy winner Billy Porter as Pray Tell, Mj Rodriguez as Blanca and Indya Moore as Angel.

37. ""The Queen's Gambit""

The story of a fictional 1960s chess prodigy (Anya Taylor-Joy, at her absolute best) battling addiction as she rises through the ranks of the chess elite is far more engrossing than it sounds. The miniseries, from the writer of ""Logan,"" manages to make its chess matches as epic as any football game and features a superb cast.

38. “Queer Eye”

Inspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles; all those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can in a week.

39. “Schitt’s Creek”

Full of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains a little perspective is always a mood booster. The final season of the Emmy-sweeping series arrives on Oct. 7.

40. “Star Trek”

The iconic TV show that started it all still holds up after all these years. The other installment in the franchise have plenty to offer, but the original series is so wonderful and smart it’s worth watching at least once through during your life.

41. “Stranger Things”

The nostalgic and paranormal series became one of Netflix’s first real sensations, and it almost lives up to all that hype. With fantastic kid actors, terrifying horror homages and all the 1980s pop culture references you can handle, the three seasons of “Stranger” are compelling and alluring.

42. “Supernatural”

Sometimes you just want a series that feels like it will never end. CW’s drama about two brothers (Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki) fighting supernatural forces of evil has enough episodes, with enough magic, mystery and tragedy, to satisfy you for weeks, months or years of watching.

43. “The Twilight Zone”

Sometimes it feels like we’re living in the twilight zone, so it can be comforting to revisit the iconic mid-century anthology series. Its science fiction stories are still so sharp and clever, with twists that surprise, delight and horrify.

44. “Twin Peaks”

David Lynch’s mystical 1990s crime drama was a ratings bonanza for a reason. (Although it flickered out in a semi-disappointing Season 2.) It’s unlike anything that had been on television before, and still stands out among similar series that popped up in its wake.

45. “Unbelievable”

Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning ProPublica article, ""Unbelievable"" is both infuriating and triumphant, highlighting the deep flaws in our criminal justice system while also celebrating justice eventually done. With a stellar cast, “Unbelievable” tells the story of a rape victim (Kaitlyn Dever) who isn’t believed by police, and the two detectives (Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) who bring her attacker to justice years later – after he raped several more women.

46. “Unorthodox”

This slightly under-the-radar miniseries is based on the true story of a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York and runs away to Germany. Often using Yiddish dialogue and authentic costuming, the series is an immersive, addictive journey.

47. “The West Wing”

The simplicity of politics in Aaron Sorkin's White House drama feels almost quaint in 2020, but the rousing speeches of President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) still inspire and captivate.

48. “When They See Us”

Ava DuVernay’s striking miniseries gives voice to the so-called Central Park Five, a group of five Black and Latino boys wrongly convicted of assault in the 1980s. With a talented group of rising stars as the falsely accused adolescents – Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Emmy-winner Jharrel Jerome and Marquis Rodriguez – “Us” brings history to the screen as a brutal, unrelenting tragedy.

49. “The Witcher”

There are TV series that are so bad they’re good, and then there’s “The Witcher,” a bacchanalia of B-movie tropes, nonsensical plots, unnecessary nudity and terrible dialogue that finds the sweet spot of being silly and sensational at once. The writers and actors, including star Henry Cavill, take this fantasy thriller both too seriously and not seriously at all, making it one of the most surprisingly delightful series on Netflix.

50. “You”

The soapy stalker thriller starring Penn Badgley was a pleasant surprise in its original home on Lifetime, and became a sensation once it moved to Netflix. Of all the current series that traffic in bad men doing bad things, “You” remains one of the few that asks interesting questions about its bad guy."
2,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/legal-experts-say-trumps-election-lawsuit-pennsylvania-baseless/6228914002/,We asked nine legal experts about Trump's latest lawsuit challenging election results in Pennsylvania. Their verdict: Dead on arrival.,"President Donald Trump's campaign launched its broadest challenge yet to the results of the election that appears destined to push him from office, accusing Pennsylvania officials of running a ""two-tiered” voting system — in-person and mail — that violates the U.S. Constitution.

Legal experts said the case has little chance of succeeding, for a variety of reasons: Courts are wary of invalidating legally cast ballots. The issues raised, even if true, don't represent a constitutional question. And mail voting, used in many states, is both common and constitutional.

The suit has ""lots of complaints about different things, and it’s not easy to see how they all fit together,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who focuses on constitutional law.

""This has a very 'throw it all at the wall and see what sticks' feel,"" he said.

At the Justice Department:Barr OKs investigations of voting irregularities despite lack of evidence of massive fraud

Why Donald Trump isn't Al Gore:How 2020 legal challenges to the election differ from 2000

The lawsuit alleges the state's mail voting system, used in a general election for the first time last week, was fatally flawed by mismanagement and improper changes or interpretations of election laws, which enabled votes to be cast and counted with virtually no oversight.

It claims Trump campaign observers were blocked from the access needed to detect and challenge inadequate verification of voters' identities and other alleged improprieties.

But as with other lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and its allies, the federal complaint offered little evidence to back its claims.

Most mail ballots supported Biden

Most mail ballots in Pennsylvania favored Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger who has been projected the winner. The lawsuit argues that in-person voting, which favored Trump, had stricter safeguards, including adequate verification of voters’ identities and monitoring by observers.

In-person voting was marked by ""transparency and verifiability,"" the lawsuit claims. Mail balloting, on the other hand, ""was cloaked in darkness and complied with none of those transparency and verifiability requirements.""

David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the Trump campaign ""continues to spread lies about transparency of this process and the access to observers. Trump campaign observers and Republican party observers were present at every moment that every ballot was considered in Pennsylvania.""

He said the Trump campaign admitted as much during a hearing before a federal judge last week, when a lawyer said there were ""a non-zero number"" of observers from the campaign present during ballot counting in Philadelphia.

Fact check:We fact-checked President Trump's speech about the election. Here's what we found.

Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, noted that Pennsylvania's system for identifying voters is the same — verification of their signature — whether they cast ballots in person or by mail.

The lawsuit also criticizes the three-day extension of the deadline for receiving absentee and mail votes, from Election Day until Nov. 6. The change, recommended by the Secretary of State's office and upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, is now the subject of a state GOP request for an emergency injunction by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Legal experts say lawsuit has no merit

Trump's campaign lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction preventing the state from certifying election results.

Laura Humphrey, a spokeswoman for Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, said the office could not comment on pending litigation. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro called the suit ""meritless"" and said the election was ""overseen by bipartisan election officials and was lawful, fair and secure.""

Shapiro said the lawsuit will end up like others filed in Pennsylvania, ""found to have no merit by courts at all levels.""

Legal experts agreed.

Trump's new campaign:Flurry of election lawsuits in search of strategy

Battleground election lawsuits:Most Republican lawsuits challenging election results in battleground states haven't gone far

Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, said in an email he could not imagine federal courts citing insufficient oversight of ballot counting ""as the basis for disallowing votes.""

""What is crucial is that courts are very reluctant to disqualify ballots that were lawfully cast,"" Chemerinsky said.

Rick Hasen, an election law expert from the University of California in Irvine, said the lawsuit is “extremely unlikely” to change the outcome in Pennsylvania or the national outcome favoring Biden.

“Its key claim, that there’s some inequality in the treatment of mail-in ballot and in-person ballots, could have been brought months ago,” Hasen said. “It does not seem calculated to get any relief other than delay.”

Barry Richard, who represented President George W. Bush in the legal fight over the 2000 presidential race, said the alleged violations raised in the complaint — including unequal treatment of in-person and mail-in voters, the unauthorized extension of time to resolve signature issues, unsolicited mail-in ballots sent to voters, and positioning poll watchers far from ballot processing — do not rise to the level of federal violations that could go before the U.S. Supreme Court.

If upheld, allegations would cast shadow over mail voting elsewhere

The Trump campaign invokes the Equal Protection Clause, alleging mail-in voters were not subjected to the same verification and level of transparency as in-person voters. That's not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Richard said, because voters can choose whether to vote in person or by mail, and the issue at hand is that ballots — not voters — are treated differently.

Danielle Lang, co-director of voting rights and redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center, an organization that supports unrestricted access to voting, said the lawsuit ""is essentially an attempt to disallow mail-in voting after the fact."" By extension, that would cast a shadow over the accuracy and reliability of mail voting in other states, including those that Trump won, she said.

The Secretary of State's guidance, Becker said, was known well before the election and litigated. Now that they know the score, the Trump campaign wants to change the rules,"" he said.

And Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard Law School, said the lawsuit ""fails to allege facts sufficient to support a conclusion that the relief sought would alter the election's result — a key difference between this complaint and the submission leading the Supreme Court to intervene in the state recount in Bush v. Gore.""

As of Monday, Biden led in Pennsylvania by more than 45,000 votes — greater than Trump’s lead when he won Pennsylvania in 2016.

“Neither Trump nor (Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton) raised questions then,” Becker said. “We literally have done mail-in voting all over the country for almost 200 years. This is not a new thing.”

“Are they complaining about mail-in voting in Utah where President Trump won and which has always done mail-in voting?” Becker asked. “Are they complaining in other states, such as Ohio and Florida, which saw massive amounts of mail-in voting?”

The FDA issued an emergency use authorization to drug-maker Lilly for bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody that mimics the immune system’s response to infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

""The data is very solid,"" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, head of Infectious Disease at ProHEALTH, an independent, physician-led healthcare organization

The drug is similar to a pair of antibodies made by Regeneron that President Donald Trump has said “cured” him of COVID-19.

Regeneron has also applied for FDA authorization for its drug, REGN-COV2.

FDA’s emergency authorization was based on data from a study of the drug in 465 people who had COVID-19 but weren’t hospitalized. Some patients got the drug, some got a placebo.

Most patients in both groups had cleared the virus from their system within 11 days.

However, in people who were at high risk of severe COVID disease, only 3% of those who got the drug went to the emergency room or were hospitalized. Among people who got the placebo, 10% ended up hospitalized or visiting the ER.

A clinical trial of the same drug in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized was stopped because the drug didn't help those patients recover from a more advanced stage of their disease.

“If you’re a hospital administration, you look at the number of hospital bed and ventilators and you think that 3% hospitalization versus 10% hospitalization could make a difference,” said John Scott, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

As case numbers rise around the country, “Everything is going to help at the right point in time,” he said. “But it’s not going to help nearly as much as people wearing masks and socially distancing.”

COVID-19 NEWS:US surpasses 10 million cases; President-elect Joe Biden announces task force

EARLY FINDINGS:Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate found to be 90% effective

The federal government has already agreed to spend $375 million to provide 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab for high-risk patients, who will not have to pay out-of-pocket costs for the medication.

According to FDA’s authorization, bamlanivimab is allowed to be used to treat recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients.

Delivered via a single dose infusion, the medication should be given as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 10 days of symptom onset, according to the company.

FDA did not license the drug but instead granted it an Emergency Use Authorization. This is a fast-tracked approval process that differs from a regular drug license application in several ways, though the company still must prove to FDA the drug is safe and effective."

We're all going to miss you.""

Several years earlier, after the two had worked together behind the scenes to broker a major tax deal, the Kentucky senator invited Biden to an event at the University of Louisville as a gesture of goodwill.

“You want to see whether a Republican and Democrat really like each other,’’ Biden said as McConnell looked on. “Well, I’m here to tell you we do.’’

That friendship will be tested now that Biden has been declared the nation's 46th president and McConnell is expected to return as the majority leader of a Senate that will be asked to pass the incoming president's legislative priorities, approve his cabinet members and confirm his judicial appointments.

None of that bodes well for Biden's liberal backers who expected voters would elect a Democrat-controlled Senate ready to pass a progressive agenda: undoing the Trump administration tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting elements of the Green New Deal, and expanding government-sponsored health care.

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who will chair the Budget Committee if Republicans keep control, called such liberal priorities ""dead on arrival"" in the Senate.

Like McConnell, Graham counts himself as a long-time friend of the new president. He believes he can reach common ground with the incoming president on cabinet appointments and on legislation such as an infrastructure bill, targeted immigration reform and regulating social media companies.

But Graham said his personal affection for Biden won't make him give in on issues.

""I will try to help where I can and oppose him where I must,"" Graham told reporters Friday.

More:Mitch McConnell once called Joe Biden 'a real friend.' Now he's silent amid attacks

The prospect of continued GOP control of the upper chamber is already forcing Biden and his advisers to rethink who they might appoint to the cabinet, opting for more centrist choices that could win quick approval over liberal nominees whose confirmations could drag on for weeks and still fall short, according to news reports.

Biden brings to the White House four decades of experience and friendships in the Senate – including with McConnell. But without the ability to control the Senate, Democrats will have to take a more modest approach to the changes they want to make on taxes, climate change and other issues through negotiated compromises, said Scott Segal, a prominent Washington lobbyist.

“An institutionalist like Joe Biden knows that's all he can get,” Segal said. “And I would stress here that Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell may have been gladiators against one another, both in the Senate, and in this election season, but they know each other very well.”

Biden optimistic he can work with Republicans

Republicans have yet to secure their Senate majority in the next Congress though most analysts expect they will come January.

GOP incumbents are winning in two states (Alaska and North Carolina) that have yet to be called. That would mean Republicans would have to win just one of the two Georgia runoff elections scheduled for Jan. 5 to maintain their power.

Biden last week expressed confidence that he could work with Republicans on issues like health care.

“Why? Because I think they're seeing the reaction of the American people,” he told reporters soon after casting his own ballot last month. “Overwhelmingly, the American people think drug prices are too high.”

Throughout the campaign, Biden dismissed criticism from the left that he has too rosy a picture of Republicans’ willingness to find common ground and that the political dynamics have drastically changed since the days when we worked closely with GOP Senate colleagues like McConnell.

Biden promised that one of his first actions would be calling Republicans to say: “We've got to figure out how we're going to move forward here. Because there are so many things we really do agree on.”

Without the threat of President Donald Trump going after errant Republicans, Biden argued, at least some GOP senators would be willing to forge bipartisan deals.

But partisan feelings remain raw – especially toward McConnell – for Republicans' role in confirming Trump's pick, Amy Coney Barrett, to the Supreme Court only days before the presidential election.

And critics note that for all the on-the-surface camaraderie, McConnell did little to stop an investigation this year by GOP senators into allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, involving Ukraine. The probe, which backers had touted would discredit the vice president, found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by either Biden.

Still, the cloud it generated provided the former vice president's critics ammunition to use against his candidacy.

Despite friendship, deals will be difficult to reach

Former Senate aides say while McConnell and Biden have a better relationship than the Kentucky Republican had with President Barack Obama, Biden is unlikely to achieve the agenda he and other Democrats promoted on the campaign trail.

""I expect (McConnell) – and most of his caucus – will do everything in their power to block a Biden legislative agenda,"" said Jim Manley, who worked as a top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who often sparred with McConnell.

Manley said there was a measurable difference between the treatment the Kentucky senator gave Obama and other top Democrats compared with Biden. He cited Biden's lengthy negotiations with McConnell during the 2013 fiscal cliff crisis, which primarily featured the two leaders trading phone calls as the rest of Washington eagerly awaited a deal to prevent automatic tax hikes and spending cuts.

Biden's discussions with McConnell went around Reid, who was the top Democrat at the time, Manley recalled, adding at one point an upset Reid threw a draft of the deal in the fireplace to destroy it.

It was far from the first time Biden and McConnell went against the mandates of their own parties to work together on massive deals. The two leaders also came together for a bipartisan compromise during the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011 that prevented the country from going into default.

But just as progressives will push Biden not to cave, McConnell faces similar pressure from his right flank.

""McConnell may try to isolate Biden to cut deals, but I don't believe the caucus will agree with it,"" Manley said. ""The Republican party has changed.""

Manley noted the partisan tensions that have divided Washington and the country would not simply go away under a Biden presidency.

""There's a chance that McConnell touts his ability to cut deals with Biden as he's done in the past, but I'm not really convinced that's going to happen.""

Biden could use executive orders to fulfill agenda

Elaine Kamarck, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked for Vice President Al Gore, expects tensions will lessen after Trump leaves office, even though the election revealed that the country is still deeply divided.

“I think that we will see a lessening of this polarization for one simple fact: the president of the United States will not be fanning the flames,"" she said.

More:With Biden winning the popular vote, here's how America could end the Electoral College

Molly Reynolds, an expert on Congress at the Brookings Institution, said Republican senators' reactions to Biden’s cabinet nominees will be an early indication of their relationship.

“Do they confirm them? Do they simply not bring some of them to the floor?” Reynolds asked. “That’s something I’ll be watching closely.”

Biden could also take a page from Trump who issued a flurry of executive orders when he couldn't get legislative proposals through Congress, a strategy that groups such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and the Progressive Change Institute want him to take.

But the incoming president indicated he doesn’t want to be limited to such steps that could be reversed by his successor or by courts.

“I’ve got to get the votes,” Biden said. “We’re a democracy. We need consensus.”"

Some GOP donors aren't keen to help Trump with election lawsuits,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s campaign is aggressively seeking donations to pay for lawsuits and recounts in a handful of states where Democrat Joe Biden won, but some GOP donors are already moving on to other fights, such as a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that may decide control of the U.S. Senate.

An abandonment of institutional Republican donors for Trump’s legal cause would leave the campaign in a tough spot as it vows to launch a series of legal battles in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and elsewhere – a multifront effort that would almost certainly require the party to shell out tens of millions of dollars in legal fees.

Three GOP donors speaking to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations echoed an argument that has been raised by legal experts in recent days: Trump's effort to retain power through the courts may result in a few battles won but it won't win the war for his reelection absent some bombshell revelation.

More:Flurry of election lawsuits in search of strategy, as Biden claims victory

Rather than invest money in the president's legal crusade, several donors said they were instead shifting focus to Georgia, where Republicans Kelly Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue will both face runoff elections on Jan. 5, contests that will likely decide whether Republicans retain the Senate and can serve as a check on the Biden administration.

""Republican donors are about to seek extreme social distance from Donald J. Trump,” one donor told USA TODAY. ""President Trump should...call off the legal dogs.”

So far, there is little indication that they will. The campaign has solicited legal donations from mega donors and also blasted out fundraising solicitations for small-dollar contributions for days, using baseless claims of ""fraud,"" ""corruption"" and ""illegal votes"" that have echoed the president's own language from the White House.

Neither Trump nor his aides have presented evidence of any of election fraud. Instead, their lawsuits have focused on the fact that Republican election observers were required to keep a distance of six feet from the vote counting and a non-decisive number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania that arrived within three days after the Nov. 3 election.

Though the results of last week's election are not yet certified, Biden has substantial leads in Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. He has narrower leads in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia – though his margins there are far larger than the unofficial 1,784 lead President George W. Bush had in Florida on the morning after the 2000 election.

Several Trump aides did not respond to a request for comment. Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters in Washington on Monday that the party and the campaign had no intention of giving up the fight.

""Is it gonna be enough? We don't know. Is it going to take time? Yes, it's going to take time,"" McDaniel said. ""But what we are seeing is deeply alarming.""

One Republican donor speaking to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity said there has been no clear evidence of fraud in any of the states in question in a way that could significantly change the results. The donor was therefore opposed to going on a “blind date” by contributing additional money to the Trump campaign's legal efforts.

Over the past several days, the Trump campaign as well as the RNC have sent a flurry of text messages and emails urging supporters to contribute to the court challenges.

""President Trump is FIGHTING BACK to defend the integrity of this Election, but he can't do it alone,"" one such email read.

But when would-be donors click through that solicitation they are greeted by a website with a small-print disclaimer that states 50% of any donation will go toward the campaign's general election ""debt retirement"" effort and the other half toward the campaign's recount account. A separate fundraising effort by the ""Trump Make America Great Again Committee"" states that 60% of contributions will go toward campaign debt.

More:Trump fundraiser emails for legal challenges would also pay down debt

The extent of the Trump campaign debt, if any, will not be clear until the next round of reporting to the Federal Election Commission later this month. Those reports showed the Trump campaign had about $63 million in the bank heading into the November election, far less than the Biden campaign had available in its final weeks.

Several donors expressed frustration the Trump campaign was raising cash – potentially to retire that debt – when control of the Senate may be at stake in Georgia. Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will face each other in one of two runoffs. Perdue will run against Democrat Jon Ossoff in the other. The candidates must take part in the runoffs because none received at least 50% of the vote.

Normally, Georgia would be a lock for the Republicans but the 2020 election has made that less of a sure bet. Unofficial results showed Biden with a slim lead of 11,595 in the state in the presidential race."

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz plans to announce new COVID-19 restrictions Tuesday amid a surge in statewide infections, possibly including stricter rules for bars and restaurants. The governor will also convene a special legislative session Thursday to extend his COVID-19 peacetime emergency powers by another 30 days to help fight the spread of the coronavirus.

In Illinois, stricter coronavirus restrictions will go into effect Wednesday for some suburban counties. ""The virus is winning right now,"" Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Twitter. The governor also hinted at a possible stay-at-home order as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches.

And, in North Dakota, hospitals are at full capacity and health care workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms are being allowed to continue to work. Gov. Doug Burgum announced the special dispensation Monday, saying hospital administrators had requested it to alleviate a staffing crunch.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis extends statewide mask mandate by 30 days

To help flatten the curve of COVID-19 in Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis announced he has extended the state's mask mandate for another 30 days. He urged Coloradans to buckle down in the coming few weeks by avoiding social interactions outside of their households, washing their hands and wearing a mask.

""Let's stop this bloodshed,"" Polis added. ""All that's being asked of you is cancelling your social plans outside of your home for the next few weeks.""

Despite the fact that Colorado is experiencing its highest rates of infection and hospitalization due to the virus, Polis said the state is likely in the final sprint of its COVID-19 marathon after promising vaccine news was released Monday.

FDA gives emergency OK to drug that can keep COVID patients out of hospital

In more good news for the fight against COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration late Monday authorized use of a drug that appears to protect infected people at high risk from getting very sick. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization to drug-maker Lilly for bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody that mimics the immune system’s response to infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

""The data is very solid,"" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, head of Infectious Disease at ProHEALTH, an independent, physician-led healthcare organization

The drug is similar to a pair of antibodies made by Regeneron that President Donald Trump has said “cured” him of COVID-19. Regeneron has also applied for FDA authorization for its drug, REGN-COV2.

FDA’s emergency authorization was based on data from a study of the drug in 465 people who had COVID-19 but weren’t hospitalized. Some patients got the drug, some got a placebo. Most patients in both groups had cleared the virus from their system within 11 days.

Israel plans to begin coronavirus testing at primary international airport

Israel will soon offer coronavirus testing at its main international airport, something authorities hope will speed the revival of air travel.

Passengers at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv will be able to pay around $13 for a test and get results within 14 hours, with faster testing methods on offer in the coming weeks. Authorities say labs at the airport will be able to process 20,000 tests per day. Passengers can register starting Thursday and the testing booths open Sunday.

Israel is gradually emerging from its second nationwide lockdown since the pandemic began. The country has reported nearly 320,000 cases, including 2,674 deaths.

An earlier lockdown last spring largely succeeded in containing the outbreak, but cases surged over the summer after authorities reopened too quickly. At one point, Israel, with a population of just 9 million, had one of the world’s worst outbreaks on a per capita basis.

Dow surges 800 points on Pfizer vaccine trial results, Joe Biden win

U.S. stocks catapulted to levels just shy of records Monday after Pfizer reported the first successful late-stage clinical trial for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, a potentially huge boost to world health after the pandemic battered the global economy in the spring and led to more than one million deaths.

Global financial markets also got a boost following Democrat Joe Biden’s defeat of incumbent Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election over the weekend. Wall Street followed, seeming relieved that the limbo created by the long, market-bruising battle for the White House was finally ending.

The Dow Jones industrial average vaulted up as much as 1,610 points to a new intraday high of 29,933.83, topping its previous record on Feb. 12 before the pandemic rattled financial markets around the world. The blue-chip average, however, lost steam near the close and ended the day up 834.57 points, or 3%, to 29,157.97, its biggest percentage gain since June.

The S&P 500 index, the heart of many 401(k) accounts, jumped 1.2% to 3550.50, finishing just below its Sept. 2 record.

Another Las Vegas resort is closing midweek due to visitor slump

As visitation remains down in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shutdown, another Las Vegas Strip resort is closing during the midweek. Starting Monday, Park MGM will close from noon Mondays through noon Thursdays. The NoMad hotel at Park MGM will remain open seven days a week.

""This year has proven to be especially challenging due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the major meetings, conventions and events that typically fill Las Vegas’ calendars during the fall and winter months,"" wrote Anton Nikodemus, president and chief operating officer of the company's Las Vegas properties, in a letter to employees. ""With occupancy remaining low during weekdays, we have decided to temporarily adjust hotel operations to account for the current state of business.""

MGM Resorts does not expect to keep the closure past December, Nikodemus wrote, but will ""continue evaluating business levels.""

7,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/barr-oks-justice-dept-election-probes-despite-lack-fraud-evidence/6229191002/,Barr OKs investigations of voting irregularities despite lack of evidence of massive fraud,"WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr has authorized U.S. attorneys to pursue ""substantial allegations"" of voting irregularities during the 2020 elections, contradicting longstanding Justice Department practice of not taking steps that could impact the results of an election.

""Such inquiries and reviews may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State,"" Barr said in a memo to federal prosecutors Monday.

Though President Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly claimed there has been fraud, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. In fact, election officials from both political parties have publicly stated the election went well, though they're having been minor issues that are typical in elections, including voting machines breaking and ballots that were miscast and lost.

TRUMP ISN'T GORE:Why 2020's legal challenges are so different from 2000, experts say

Barr noted in his memo that the Justice Department has not concluded that ""voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election.""

The memo would allow prosecutors to pursue investigations into election-related matters before results are certified. The action could raise criticisms that Trump, who has yet to concede after losing to President-elect Joe Biden, will use the Justice Department to try to tip the results in his favor.

The memo also prompted Richard Pilger, who oversees election crime investigations within the Justice Department, to step down from his post, according to the New York Times and Reuters. The department did not respond to questions from USA TODAY regarding Pilger.

Vanita Gupta, who oversaw the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama, said Barr’s memo had “no factual basis,” and states, not the federal government, is in charge of elections.

“Scaremongering about opening investigations doesn’t change (the) result,” Gupta tweeted.

TRUMP'S LAWSUITS:Here's where they stand in battleground states

In an email to colleagues Monday, Pilger said he's resigning from his position after familiarizing himself with the Justice Department's new policy ""and its ramifications."" Gupta shared the email on Twitter.

""I have enjoyed very much working with you for over a decade to aggressively and diligently enforce federal crime election law, policy, and practice without partisan fear or favor,"" Pilger wrote.

The Trump campaign has filed several lawsuits in battleground states that Biden won by thousands of votes; some of which have been tossed by the courts for lack of evidence.

Biden holds substantial leads in five battleground states, and experts say it's unlikely that any legal action the Trump campaign pursues would affect the outcome. The closest state, Georgia, which will hold a recount, has Biden ahead by more than 10,000 votes as of Monday.

In the memo to U.S. attorneys, which was first reported by the Associated Press, Barr wrote ""it will likely be prudent"" to begin preliminary investigations into election-related matters.

""While it is imperative that credible allegations be addressed in a timely and effective manner, it is equally imperative that Department personnel exercise appropriate caution and maintain the Department's absolute commitment to fairness, neutrality and non-partisanship,"" Barr wrote.

ELECTION INTEGRITY:How Republicans and Democrats in every state together protect against voter fraud

States have until Dec. 8 to resolve election disputes, including recounts and court contests over the results. Members of the Electoral College meet Dec. 14 to finalize the outcome.

The Justice Department also recently issued new guidance allowing prosecutors more authority to take action on voter fraud allegations even as voting is underway. Spokesman Matt Lloyd said last month that the guidance was part of communication that is ""routinely"" sent via email to federal prosecutors during election season.

Earlier on Monday, Barr met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Capitol Hill. The Justice Department declined to comment on the meeting.

McConnell backed Trump's legal efforts, saying the president is ""100% within his rights"" to challenge the election results, although he did not echo baseless claims about voter fraud and a Democratic conspiracy to steal the election.

Here's what we might expect from Biden over the next four years:

Taxes

Biden has repeatedly said that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a cent more in taxes. But those earning above that threshold will lose their tax cuts and likely pay a bit more.

Biden has recommended raising the marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for the nation's highest pool of earners, according to The Tax Foundation and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Americans with more than $1 million in total income would see income brought in from dividends, as well as capital gains, taxed like their wages, and pare the itemized deductions taxpayers could declare, Moody's says.

Meanwhile, Biden campaign spokesman Michael Gwin has told Reuters that Biden will effectively lower taxes for the middle class by giving them refundable credits that reduce what they pay for health care coverage and help them to purchase their first home and pay for child care.

Most immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many Americans struggling to pay their bills, Biden says he will expand the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17, and $3,600 for the youngest children. That would mean according to his website that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle schooler would receive $6,600.

Health care

The Affordable Care Act, which provides health care for millions of Americans, hangs in the balance with the U.S. Supreme Court set to weigh in on Nov. 10 on a lawsuit brought by several Republican-led states and the Trump administration to abolish the ACA.

But Biden has a plan for not only salvaging the law but making it stronger.

""What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option,'' Biden said in the final presidential debate against President Donald Trump. ""It becomes Bidencare.""

He says Americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting Americans who couldn't access Medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the ACA.

Biden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through ACA marketplaces. He says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.

And Americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a Biden administration says it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.

However, ""most of Biden’s health care plan would require legislation, so passing any of it would require Democrats to control the Senate as well as the House,'' Oxford Economics says. ""In the absence of legislation, we expect Biden to reverse Trump’s executive actions that have curtailed the ACA.""

Housing

A sizable chunk of a family's budget goes toward covering the cost of housing.

Nearly half of Americans who rent pay more than 30% of their income on those monthly payments, according to the Center for American Progress, limiting how much they have left to spend on other necessities like groceries or education.

Biden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help Americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low wage earners.

Biden has talked about making sure Americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive Section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the Section 8 program for those who qualify.

Biden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly African Americans, to buy or hold onto property – from onerous interest rates that leave them vulnerable to falling behind on payments, ending up in foreclosure, to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by Black people.

Bias in lending, as well as predatory financing that focused on Black Americans in the years before the 2008 recession, have been key reasons for the wide wealth gap between Blacks and whites, experts say, leaving African Americans at a disadvantage when it comes to passing down resources to future generations or funding the launch of a business.

Biden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. He will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.

Child care, free early education

Biden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families.

He will offer tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care. Parents earning less than $125,000 annually can get back up to half what they spend on child care for kids under age 13. The cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. And families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.

For children under the age of 5, Biden supports the Child Care for Working Families Act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.

Additionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. That amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to Biden's campaign site.

Biden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.

College costs

Biden wants to make community college and comparable training programs free. And students from households earning less than $125,000 a year will not have to pay tuition if they attend four-year public colleges and universities.

He also wants to raise the value of Pell Grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.

College debt

Biden says that he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. After deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.

If they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years, the balance of their loans will be forgiven.

Borrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.

Individuals making $25,000 or less a year will not owe any payments on their undergraduate federal student loans and also won’t accrue any interest on those loans.

He would also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.

White House Press Secretary McEnany, the federal employee speaking in a ""personal capacity"" as Trump campaign advisor and spokesperson, was explaining President Donald Trump's refusal to concede the Nov. 3 election to Democrat Joe Biden.

Shortly following McEneny's claim that the Democratic party was ""welcoming fraud"" and ""welcoming illegal voting,"" Cavuto appeared at his desk on Fox's split screen and stopped the network's live coverage.

""Whoa, whoa, whoa, I just think we have to be very clear,"" Cavuto said, referring to McEnany's statements. ""She's charging the other side is welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal voting. Unless she has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue showing you this.""

Cavuto added: ""I want to make sure that maybe they do have something to back that up. But that is an explosive charge to make, that the other side is effectively rigging and cheating. If she does bring proof of that, of course we will take you back.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Fox News for elaboration or comment on the decision.

President Trump has made repeated and baseless claims that the Democratic party has tried to steal the election. On Saturday, following the announcement of Biden's projected win, Trump put out a statement that falsely accused Biden's campaign of urging the counting of ""fraudulent"" or ""manufactured"" ballots and those cast by dead people.

Here's how it works: Each coach pairs up two singers on their team to duet a song of the coach's choice. The singers then battle it out and only one is dubbed a winner. Each coach has a save and a steal. (We will get to that later.)

Things have been shaken up this season. Instead of one boxing ring-inspired stage, there are two separate stages so contestants can adhere to social distancing guidelines amid the new normal of the COVID-19 era.

""The show looks a little different, but the music and the talent’s still there,"" said Blake Shelton.

Last week on 'The Voice': Gwen Stefani enlists Trace Adkins to beat ‘burnt out’ Blake Shelton

The battle between Team Gwen Stefani's Lauren Frihauf, 16, and Payge Turner, 27, came with a knockout punch. Stefani assigned the pair ""If the World Was Ending"" by JP Saxe and Julia Michaels, who served as the musical advisor for Team Stefani.

""I have this disaster that I have to choose one. I’m screwed again,"" Stefani said. Even Kelly Clarkson wouldn't want to be in her shoes: ""I do not envy you.""

Stefani went with Turner. Frihauf's time on the show, however, was not over, because John Legend used his steal! (Each coach has one opportunity to steal a contestant during the Battle Round.)

""I remember turning for you (in the Blind Auditions) and I feel like you deserve a chance to keep going,"" Legend said. But, not so fast.

Leave it to Shelton to grab Legend’s thunder. He hit his steal button, cutting Legend off and finishing his sentence: ""… on a team that can win.""

Legend rebuked, ""Stay out of my way, Blake Shelton."" He added: ""I just recall in the Blind Auditions, Blake heard you and decided not to turn around.""

Ouch. Frihauf ultimately went with Legend, but Shelton is looking on the bright side.

""I mean it sucks for me to lose to John,"" Shelton said. ""But at least it wasn’t me losing to Kelly. That really sucks.""

That was not the only steal of the night.

Bailey Rae, 18, and Sid Kingsley, 37, entered the ring for the last head-to-head of the night. And let’s just say, it was one to remember. Legend selected Chris Stapleton's ""Tennessee Whiskey"" for the pair, a perfect blend of country and soul to allow each singer to showcase their distinctive style.

The duet received a standing ovation from the coaches.

""Both of you gave a fantastic performance,"" Legend said before naming Rae the winner. ""That was an impossible decision for me.""

But Clarkson had the final say, stealing Kingsley.

""I was shocked (Legend) didn’t pick him,"" Clarkson said. ""We are going to rub it in John’s face.""

""The Voice"" continues Tuesday at 8 EST/PST on NBC."

Vice President Mike Pence exhorts Trump campaign to continue challenging election result,"WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence tweeted Monday that he is firmly behind efforts to keep counting “legal” votes as the Trump campaign tries to find a way to undo Joe Biden’s victory, which has been declared by media networks and recognized by a growing number of prominent Republicans.

“Told @VP Team Today: ‘it ain’t over til it’s over .. and this AIN’T over!’ President @realDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” the vice president wrote in a tweet.

It's the first public statement Pence has made since Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election Saturday.

President Donald Trump and his legal team continue to make the unsubstantiated claim that several states – notably Pennsylvania – have counted ballots they shouldn’t have and prematurely awarded Biden the victory he needed to win the White House.

Trump campaign lawyers and their GOP allies are challenging the vote of several key states, including Georgia, Nevada and Michigan, that narrowly went for Biden.

More:If Trump still won't concede to Biden, he'll break more than a century of tradition

In Pennsylvania: On Monday evening, the Trump campaign filed a federal suit in Pennsylvania alleging voters were treated differently depending on whether they voted by mail or in person, creating an unconstitutional, “two tiered” system. The Trump campaign, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and others have also filed a flurry of lawsuits and legal briefs about the controversial three-day extension for voters to return mail ballots, the rights of people to observe ballot counting, and the process for “curing” ballots when mistakes are made.

In Arizona: The Trump campaign has sued in Maricopa County, alleging Arizona voters were given Sharpie pens to mark selections, and when vote tabulation machines flagged some ballots as defective, poll workers improperly overrode the machines. State election officials have denied that ballots were tabulated improperly.

More:Most Republican lawsuits challenging election results in battleground states haven't gone far

In Georgia: The campaign continues to highlight voting irregularities and the president's claims of fraud. Both the campaign and the president have not provided any proof to back their unsubstantiated claims. And Brad Raffensperger, the state's Republican secretary of State, has rejected claims of widespread fraud in the state’s elections.

In Michigan: A state judge threw out a Trump campaign lawsuit last week seeking an order that the Secretary of State provide “meaningful access” for observers to watch ballot counting and allow it to view videotaped surveillance of ballot drop boxes. The Trump campaign is appealing.

In Nevada: Republicans have brought cases in state and federal court alleging problems with software used to match signatures on mail ballots, but judges declined to stop vote counting.

""President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor Monday. ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light. And if the Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny.”

While McConnell backed Trump's legal efforts, he did not echo the president's baseless claims about voter fraud and Democrats breaking the law to steal the election from him.

Even as Trump continues to allege voter fraud without providing evidence, prominent Republicans – including former President George W. Bush – have begun congratulating Biden on his victory.

""I just talked to the President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden,"" Bush, a Republican, said in a statement Sunday. ""I extended my warm congratulations and thanked him for the patriotic message he delivered last night."""

USA TODAY

You’re reading Our View, one of two perspectives in Today’s Debate. For the Opposing View, read “Invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act.”

Many Republicans see the Supreme Court as a vehicle for delivering the social and economic policies that they might not be able to get through Congress. That's one reason they were so eager to ram Judge Amy Coney Barrett through the confirmation process in the days before an election.

But the court has not always played along. While it has shown a peculiar loyalty to Republicans on election law, it has sometimes angered them with expansive rulings on gay rights and same-sex couples.

Nothing, however, has tested the justices' independence as much as their handling of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. That is because Republicans keep demanding that judges strike down the law — running their cases up to the nation's highest court, failing and then starting the process anew — even as GOP efforts to kill the law the legitimate way, by enacting a law repealing it, keep coming up short.

Third Obamacare challenge

Tuesday, the Supreme Court hears a third Republican-initiated challenge to the 2010 law. This time it will be during a pandemic that is surging throughout the United States, has already claimed the lives of 238,000 Americans and has caused millions of people to lose their medical insurance along with their jobs.

About 20 million people rely on the ACA for health coverage. Millions more benefit from it in other ways, including knowing that it will be there if they lose their job and knowing that they can't be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition, as was the case before Obamacare was enacted.

Coverage for preexisting conditions is crucial at a time when more than 10 million Americans have tested positive for COVID-19 and could develop long-term conditions that, without the ACA, could result in denial of coverage.

The ACA has become so critical to our nation's medical care system, the case before the court has attracted a deluge of legal briefs from health organizations saying that striking the law down would cause utter chaos. The briefs come not just from doctor and nurse groups but also from hospitals, insurers and other big corporate interests.

Co-opting the Supreme Court

What makes the latest attempt to co-opt the Supreme Court particularly pernicious is that this effort is essentially a tag-team match between politicians and judges.

In 2012, the high court upheld the ACA's constitutionality after Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that the law’s mandate that individuals have coverage or pay a financial penalty could be construed as a tax. Therefore, he reasoned, the act passed constitutional muster based on Congress’ power to levy taxes.

The drama, however, was not over. After one more failed attempt to repeal the law in 2017 (this time despite the GOP having control of the White House and both chambers of Congress) Republicans decided to repeal the penalty and demand that courts do away with the rest.

Officially, the case before the high court is about “severability” — whether the nearly 1,000 pages of Obamacare can stand if a few critical lines are cut out. Contrary to Democratic rhetoric leading up to the election, many legal scholars doubt that the court, in a decision expected next spring, would throw out the whole law.

Even so, at a time when Americans are hunkered down and masked up in the midst of a deadly pandemic, the last thing they should have to worry about is losing their medical safety net because Republicans are hellbent on shredding it."

Opinion contributor

You’re reading the Opposing View, one of two perspectives in Today’s Debate. For Our View, read “Affordable Care Act is critical, especially in the war against COVID-19.”

The fate of former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act is, once again, before the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the justices will hear arguments in California v. Texas on how to handle the statute now that Congress has eliminated a crucial provision.

In 2012, the Supreme Court held the “most natural interpretation” of the ACA’s individual mandate was as an unconstitutional command for Americans to buy insurance but that, due to the accompanying penalty for noncompliance, it was “fairly possible” to read the penalty as a tax. It possessed “the essential feature of any tax: It produces at least some revenue for the government,” the court explained.

But since then, Congress eliminated the penalty. So it no longer provides revenue for the government and can only be read as the “most natural interpretation” — an unconstitutional command to buy insurance.

Congress did not include an explicit clause in the law concerning what to do if the individual mandate is unconstitutional. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s obligation now is to follow what Congress would have wanted if the individual mandate were struck down.

Congress specified that the individual mandate was “essential” to the ACA, and that its “absence ... would undercut federal regulation of the health insurance market.”

Despite the fact this language was relegated to the legislative findings section of the statute, it is nonetheless the most suggestive evidence of Congress’ intent we have.

Regardless of whether the ACA was a just or effective plan for helping people gain access to health care, the Supreme Court’s job is not to decide matters of policy. That is for the elected branches of our government.

Democracy can only function if courts abide by the will of the people as expressed, however imperfectly, through our congressional representatives. Setting aside controversies over legal standing, the Supreme Court should respect Congress’ finding that the individual mandate is “essential” to the ACA and hold the law invalid in its entirety.

""I could say I'm the most bullied person in the world,"" she lamented to ABC in her one mainstream media interview, during her tour of Africa in 2018, for which she was dressed like a colonial big-game hunter with a pith helmet on a nearby table.

In short, after all the Sturm und Drang of the most idiosyncratic FLOTUS term in the modern history of American first ladies, it would be understandable if Trump viewed leaving it all behind with a sense of good riddance.

""I think Melania will probably be secretly relieved,"" says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of books about the White House, including ""First Women,"" about modern first ladies. ""This is not what she signed up for.""

First lady blasts Biden, Dems at solo event in Pa. AP

Americans might have suspected ambivalence based on her decision to not move into the White House on Jan. 21. She and her husband said she waited five months so that Barron could finish the school year in New York.

From that surprising beginning, Trump was often under siege in the East Wing, but with few connections to living former first ladies to call and commiserate.

""She feels like she can’t do anything right, and though every first lady feels that way at some point, she has the disadvantage of being married to someone who has burned every bridge to the past,"" Andersen Brower says.

Having been born and raised in the central Europe country of Slovenia (formerly part of Yugoslavia), Trump, 50, has been a U.S. citizen only 14 years. But the role she was expected to embrace can be hard to discern even for politically and socially savvy women born and raised in the USA.

""The job is so unclear anyway, so expecting her to (immediately) understand the weight of it and know what to do, and meanwhile none of the others want to talk to her except maybe Laura Bush, who came to tea a few times, because they all dislike her husband so much.""

Myra Gutin, a professor of communication and first-lady historian at Rider University in New Jersey, thinks Trump will be judged ""an average first lady,"" one who fulfilled ceremonial responsibilities and launched a first-lady project. But ""she was not an activist and rarely a presidential surrogate,"" Gutin says.

There is little doubt Trump was an historic first lady, more for what she is rather than what she did: The first foreign-born FLOTUS in 195 years. The first former fashion model who also posed nude. The first to be the president's third wife. The first for whom English was not her first language.

After many delays, she launched her first-lady initiative, Be Best, which was aimed at ""helping children"" by fighting online bullying and opioid abuse.

""Many Americans never developed any definite perception of her,"" says Gutin. ""Her White House initiative, though well-intentioned, never particularly resonated.""

Betty Boyd Caroli, author of multiple White House-related books, including ""First Ladies,"" says Trump ""hasn’t done anything significant"" during her term.

""Her take on the job seems to be to do as little as possible, and of course some Americans, but not a majority I think, like that,"" Caroli says. ""I expect her Be Best project to get buried, to the extent it ever existed as far as staff and funding go, quicker than Nancy Reagan’s Foster Grandparent plan.""

She doesn't see Trump taking on a new cause or, say, getting involved in her husband's post-presidency foundation or library, if there is one, largely because she wasn't much of an activist before.

""As far as I can tell, Melania was not one for projects even before the White House,"" Caroli says.

It's possible that Trump will continue to snub the media, even as her husband is expected to continue haranguing them. He might even join the media, possibly through a post-presidency Trump-branded television network – Trump TV, as it were – that's been floated.

Caroli thinks the outgoing first lady might make occasional attempts to send snarky messages to the media through her clothes.

During her 2018 ABC interview in Africa, she claimed her infamous ""I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?"" jacket was really a message to the media. Yet, when she answered questions during a gaggle with reporters (Egypt's Great Sphinx in the background) on the same trip, she derided the media for paying too much attention to her clothes, saying she wished people would “focus on what I do, not what I wear."""

Barber will hold the highest leadership position within the brigade for the spring semester, the 16th woman to hold the position since women were allowed to attend the Naval Academy beginning in 1976. The first female brigade commander was then-Midshipman 1st Class Juliane Gallina in 1992.

“Earning the title of brigade commander speaks volumes, but the title itself is not nearly as significant as the opportunity it brings to lead a team in doing something I believe will be truly special,” Barber said in a statement. “I am humbled to play a small role in this momentous season of American history.”

Barber, of Lake Forest, Illinois, is studying mechanical engineering and hopes to become a Marine Corps ground officer, officials said. She created a STEM mentorship program for young girls of color and organized a networking breakfast to connect current Black midshipmen with alumni.

In a video, Barber said women like Janie Mines, the first Black woman to graduate from the Naval Academy, motivate her to ""follow her footsteps and be her wildest dream.""

Mines congratulated Barber on social media, saying: ""You are my wildest dream.""

“This bought me to tears,"" Mines said on LinkedIn. ""40 years later. Thank you Sydney! Love you!""

The bridge commander is selected by senior leadership and the commandant's staff. Midshipman 1st Class Ryan Chapman currently holds the semester-long position.

“She is a catalyst for action, a visionary, a listener, a doer and a person driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of passion and heart full of love,” Chapman said in a statement. “Sydney is the perfect person to lead the brigade.”

Barber has also interned with the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She was named a 2020 Truman Scholar national finalist for her research on developing legislative strategies to address education disparities in communities of color.

“Sydney stands out amongst her peers, for not only her exemplary record, but for her clear vision of how she intends to make the world a better place and her accompanying bias for action,"" Lt. Cmdr. Darby Yeager said in a statement.

Barber is not the only Black woman to make history this year in military promotions. Lt. j.g. Madeline Swegle in July became the U.S. Navy's first Black female tactical fighter pilot.

The news of Swegle's achievement came the same day a female soldier graduated from the Army's elite Special Forces course, becoming the first woman to join a Green Beret team. The Army does not release the identities of its service members ""due to unique missions assigned upon graduation.""

Eta is the 12th named storm to hit U.S. shores this year, an all-time record for landfalls.

Eta could approach the Florida Gulf Coast later this week as a tropical storm.

It is finally Florida's turn to feel the wrath of the 2020 hurricane season.

Tropical Storm Eta made landfall in the Florida Keys at Lower Matecumbe Key on Sunday night with winds estimated at 65 mph. The storm landed in Florida just days after hitting Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, leaving scores of people dead and hundreds missing in Mexico and Central America.

Rain from the storm flooded much of South Florida over the weekend.

“Never seen this, never, not this deep,” said Anthony Lyas, who has lived in his now-waterlogged Fort Lauderdale neighborhood since 1996. He described hearing water and debris slamming against his shuttered home overnight.

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it a 100-year rain event.

Eta is the 12th named storm to hit U.S. shores this year, an all-time record for landfalls, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. It's also the first landfalling tropical storm in Florida in November since Mitch in 1998, he said.

There was more history late Monday: The National Hurricane Center reported a record-breaking 29th named storm this season.

Subtropical Storm Theta has emerged in the open northeast Atlantic Ocean but poses no immediate threat to land, forecasters said. Theta, which was moving east at 15 mph, had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of 10 p.m. EST.

The center said Theta broke a previous record of 28 named storms set in 2005.

Although the center of Eta was offshore, bands of heavy rain and gusty winds will continue to feed into the Florida Keys and the Florida Peninsula, the Weather Channel said.

But after the storm spent several days in the Gulf this week, the Hurricane Center said it could still be a threat. ""Eta could approach the Florida Gulf Coast later this week as a tropical storm, and possibly bring impacts from rain, wind and storm surge.""

Eta had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph on Monday night and was centered about 90 miles north-northwest of the western tip of Cuba, the Hurricane Center said. It was moving southwest at 9 mph.

Florida officials had closed beaches, ports and COVID-19 testing sites, shut down public transportation and urged residents to stay off the street as the storm approached. Several shelters also opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low-lying areas.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had declared a state of emergency Saturday for eight counties at the end of the state as Eta approached, urging residents to stock up on supplies.

On Sunday, the storm swelled rivers and flooded coastal zones in Cuba, where 25,000 had been evacuated. But there were no reports of deaths.

Authorities in Central America were still surveying the damage Monday after days of torrential rain. Official death tolls totaled at least 68 people, but hundreds more were missing.

Searchers in Guatemala were still digging for people believed buried by a massive, rain-fueled landslide. Authorities on Sunday raised the known death toll there to 27 from 15 and said more than 100 were missing in Guatemala, many of them in a landslide in San Cristobal Verapaz.

At least 20 people also were reported dead in southern Mexico and local officials in Honduras reported 21, though the national disaster agency had confirmed only eight.

22,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/09/president-donald-trump-fires-defense-secretary-mark-esper/5539760002/,President Trump fires Defense Secretary Mark Esper after contentious tenure,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump terminated Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday, days after his election loss to Joe Biden and following a series of clashes between Esper and Trump over the withdrawal of U.S. forces from key bases abroad, using active-duty troops to quell domestic protests and banning Confederate emblems from military installations.

Trump made the announcement on Twitter.

""Mark Esper has been terminated,"" Trump tweeted. ""I would like to thank him for his service.""

He named Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center as acting defense secretary.

The tweet was a sign that Trump plans to be active for the next two-and-a-half months, even as he contests the election.Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, warned Esper prior to Trump's tweet.

That includes personnel moves. Trump is considering dismissing FBI Director Christopher Wray, aides said; they also expect CIA Director Gina Haspel to depart.

The Pentagon late Monday released a letter from Esper to troops and Defense Department employees that praised them for their honor and integrity. The one-page message did not mention or thank Trump.

""I want to thank you all for living up to that standard, for remaining apolitical, and for honoring your oath to the Constitution,"" Esper wrote.

Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, blasted Trump's ouster of Esper as reckless.

“Firing the secretary of Defense in the waning weeks of the Administration undermines national security at a critical moment,"" Reed said. ""The president’s choice to fire secretary Esper is a play for attention and is yet another example of President Trump putting his ego over the needs and security of our nation.""

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, thanked Esper for his work on the National Defense Strategy that emphasizes threats from Russia and China. Inhofe added that he had spoken with Miller and would work with Trump to maintain stability at the Pentagon.

Esper, 56, had been serving as Army secretary when Trump chose him in July 2019 to replace Patrick Shanahan who had resigned as acting Defense chief after USA TODAY reported about his tumultous personal life. Esper's tenure at the Pentagon was packed with controversy and danger: Trump's decision to intervene in the military justice system to avert penalties for troops accused of war crimes; the Navy's firing of Capt. Brett Crozier after he sought aid for his COVID-19-stricken aircraft carrier; and the targeted killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani that prompted a counterattack that wounded more 100 troops.

The relationship between Trump and Esper began unraveling quickly this summer. Trump went so far as mock his name in a briefing with reporters, saying, ""Some people call him 'Yesper,'"" a dig at Esper for what had been seen as his willingness to accommodate Trump.

Esper, in an interview Nov. 4 with the Military Times, disputed that he was overly deferential to Trump.

“My frustration is I sit here and say, ‘Hmm, 18 cabinet members. Who’s pushed back more than anybody?’"" Esper said. ""Name another cabinet secretary that’s pushed back. Have you seen me on a stage saying, ‘Under the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?’""

Trump has been pushing for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and from bases located in Germany and South Korea, longtime allies. On July 29, Esper announced that 11,000 U.S. troops would be leaving Germany, relocating to U.S. and Italian bases.

Esper had portrayed the move as a strategic move that afforded the Pentagon greater flexibility in confronting adversaries such as Russia and China. Trump demolished that explanation within an hour, telling reporters that Germany was ""delinquent"" in its payments to NATO.

Esper also differed with Trump over the display of Confederate emblems and names at military installations. Trump slapped him down after Esper had expressed openness to renaming 10 military bases named after Confederate generals.

And Esper circumvented Trump on display of the Confederate battle flag at U.S. military installations. Trump has called shows of the flag a matter of free speech and not racism. Esper established a rule that relegated displays of flags to those approved by the Pentagon. The Confederate flag did not make the list.

After protesters marched in cities across the country, including Washington, following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Trump urged a crackdown.

Esper referred to American streets as battle space that governors needed to dominate, a phrase he later said he regretted. But he resisted invoking the Insurrection Act that would have allowed active-duty troops, some poised in June on the outskirts of Washington, to quell disturbances.

Trump's June 1 address promising to be a ""law and order"" president came as officers used projectiles, gas canisters and shields to force hundreds of protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House, drawing criticism that excessive force was used on peaceful demonstrators. The president then walked through the square to St. John's Church, where he posed for photos with a Bible.

Esper initially said he was unaware he would be going with Trump to the church, but revised his comment later to say he was aware of the visit but not what Trump planned to do there.

Asked June 3 if Trump had lost confidence in Esper over that issue, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany offered a tepid endorsement.

""As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper,"" she said.

""I did know that we were going to church, I was not aware that a photo-op was happening,"" Esper said.

It was not the first time Trump and Esper have differed sharply and publicly.

Esper split from Trump in January 2020 over whether the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani was due to evidence of an ""imminent threat"" to embassies. Trump claimed there was evidence of a threat to four U.S. embassies, but Esper said he hadn't seen specific evidence of threats to embassies but agreed they were potential targets.

Last year, Esper said he urged Trump not to intervene in the cases of three military members who were accused or convicted of war crimes. Pentagon officials were reportedly caught off guard by a Fox News report that Trump would offer pardons in those cases.

Esper who began his official role as defense secretary in July 2019, was previously Army secretary and acting defense secretary. Esper was Trump's second choice to step into the seven-month period of uncertainty left when former defense secretary Jim Mattis resigned in late 2018 amid bitter disagreements over foreign policy.

Esper came into the job saying his priorities were to modernize the Pentagon and balance the ""growing threats"" posed by China and Russia, and regional threats by Iran and North Korea. He said he would ""maintain pressure"" on terrorist groups, and work to upgrade weapons systems.

He served in the Army for more than 20 years, including 10 on active duty, before becoming a lobbyist. Esper was defense contractor Raytheon's vice president of government relations.

Another point of friction involved the promotion of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. An expert on Ukraine assigned to the National Security Council at the White House, Vindman testified at Trump's impeachment inquiry that his July 2019 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky was improper. Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival.

After his acquittal, Trump branded Vindman ""insubordinate"" and had him fired. Vindman's promotion to colonel appeared to languish until early July when Esper approved the list with Vindman's name on it and forwarded it to the White House. Vindman announced his intention to retire days later.

Miller is a former Pentagon official who has led the counterterrorism center since August. Prior to that he had been a senior official at the Defense Department for special operations and combating terrorism.

Miller is a combat veteran in Army Special Forces. He took part in the initial attacks in Afghanistan that overthrew the Taliban in 2001 after the 9/11 terror attacks. He lives in Virginia with his wife and has three grown children."

Facing off against a winless New York Jets team that was without their starting quarterback, the Patriots struggled inside MetLife Stadium. Even with Cam Newton playing better and Jakobi Meyers having a career game, the Patriots defense embarrassingly struggled against Joe Flacco.

Without starters Stephon Gilmore, Lawrence Guy and Ja’Whaun Bentley, it looked like the Patriots were about to be upset by the winless Jets to somehow make this 2020 season even more embarrassing. Of course, that would’ve required the Jets to play mistake-free football in the fourth quarter.

This wasn’t rock bottom on Monday night, but it was close. The Patriots needed last-minutes heroics and a fourth-quarter comeback to dispatch the woeful Jets in this 30-27 win. The Pats improved to 3-5 after Nick Folk hit a 51-yard game-winning field goal with time expiring. The Jets, meanwhile, fell to 0-9 for the first time in franchise history.

Newton finished 27-for-35 with 274 yards to go with two rushing touchdowns. Meyers had a career-best 12 receptions to go with 169 receiving yards, including a 20-yard catch to set up the game winner.

For the Patriots, a loss looked likely until J.C. Jackson stepped up to make up for a rough night. After allowing two touchdowns, the cornerback intercepted Flacco with six minutes remaining.

Newton took the field and threw three straight incomplete passes. However, the Jets were flagged for defensive holding on third down to give the Patriots life. Following a 21-yard run by Damien Harris, the Patriots running back suffered a chest injury on the next play with five minutes remaining. To add insult to injury, Meyers was flagged for holding. That put the Pats in a 20-yard hole.

With 4:43 remaining, Newton hit for a 19-yard gain on third down. That set up a fourth-and-1 and Newton kept the ball for a quarterback keeper to get the first. On the next play, with 3:28 left, Newton hit Damiere Byrd, who ran for a gain of 31 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 3-yard line.

The next two plays felt like they lasted for an eternity as Newton’s keepers went for two total yards to bring the Pats to a third-and-1 at the goal line with two minutes remaining. On the next play, Newton scored and the game was tied, 27-27, with 1:57 left.

The Jets couldn’t put together a sixth scoring drive. Deatrich Wise picked a good time to notch the Patriots’ first sack of the game, dragging down Flacco at 1:29 of the fourth quarter. That set up a third down and the Jets went three-and-out following an incomplete pass.

Newton got the ball back with 47 seconds left at the 22-yard line. He hit James White for an 11-yard gain with 41 seconds remaining. Following a White 4-yard run and 5-yard reception, the Pats were faced with a third-and-1 with 22 seconds left. Newton, again, kept the ball to pick up five yards at the 47-yard line. He spiked the ball with eight seconds left.

That’s when Meyers stepped up, again. This time, the receiver hauled in a 20-yard reception to set up Folk’s 51-yard boot.

The kick snapped a four-game losing streak and helped the Patriots avoid complete embarrassment.

The Patriots defense started an inexperienced group that included Tashawn Bower, Terez Hall and Nick Thurman in the starting lineup. The Jets took advantage of that in the opening drive to take an early 3-0 lead.

The Patriots came into this contest having failed to score a first quarter touchdown. That unfortunate trend ended on Monday, thanks to Newton. The Patriots took a 7-3 at 3:34 of the first quarter. Newton’s 33-yard pass to Jakobi Meyers set up a first-and-goal. Newton kept the ball on the play for the 5-yard touchdown run.

The Jets, however, weren’t going to go away without a fight. With the makeshift defense the Patriots had on the field, New York had a fighting chance. At 9:59 of the second quarter, Flacco hit Breshad Perriman for a 50-yard touchdown to give the Jets a 10-7 lead.

On offense, the Patriots sputtered after their fast start. In their third series, on fourth down, White ran up the middle, but fumbled. The ball was forced and recovered by Jets nose tackle Folorunso Fatukasi at 6:19 of the second quarter.

The turnover cost the Patriots three points as the Jets extended their lead to 13-7 after a 50-yard Castillo field goal at 4:33 of the second quarter.

Newton started this contest 11-for-11 passing with Meyers as his favorite target. The receiver caught all seven of his targets for a career-high 93 yards in the first half. Meyers hauled in three passes, including a third-down conversion, in the Pats’ fourth drive. That set up a 45-yard Nick Folk field goal with 1:03 left in the half to bring the Jets lead down to 13-10.

The Patriots defense meanwhile continued to look bad. The Jets needed just 38 seconds to travel 77 yards and extend their lead to 20-10 before the half. Flacco hit Mims for 15 yards and then Jason McCourty was flagged for a 42-yard defensive pass interference penalty. That led to Jamison Crowder making a remarkable 20-yard touchdown catch with 25 seconds left in the half. Officials first called it an incomplete catch before reversing the call.

The Patriots were quick to open the second half with a touchdown to bring the Jets’ lead down to 20-17. Rex Burkhead had six carries on this 13-play drive. That included two third-down conversion runs and a 1-yard touchdown run at 7:27 of the third quarter.

The Patriots defensive collapse continued. The Jets scored another touchdown on the ensuing drive. New York converted two third downs en route to Flacco hitting Perriman for a 15-yard touchdown with 30 seconds left in the third quarter. This marked the fourth-straight drive the Jets scored as the Pats fell behind 27-17.

It looked like the Pats would get lucky on the next series. After Newton and fell on a third-and-1 play, for a loss of four, the Jets sent too many players on the field for the Pats field goal attempt at the 14-yard line. That gave the Patriots a first-and-goal at the 9-yardline. However, a Michael Onwenu holding penalty pushed the offense back 10 yards. The Pats finished the drive with a 29-yard field goal from Folk. The drive ate up 9:26 of the clock and the Jets led 27-20 with 6:04 remaining.

On the next Jets play, however, Jackson changed the trajectory of the game with his interception. That gave Newton the ball back and the Pats finished this one scoring 10 points for the comeback win.

25,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/11/05/electoral-college-donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-battleground-states/6160960002/,How the Electoral College works – and how it affected battleground states in 2020,"Though Americans choose most of their elected officials by popular vote, the selection of a U.S. president is not as direct.

The presidency is decided by vote of the Electoral College, a temporary slate of 538 electors, all chosen by their state political parties. Each elector casts one vote; a presidential candidate needs 270 of these votes to win.

The process has faced mounting criticism, starting in the controversial 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore, despite having lost the popular vote.

President Donald Trump also lost the popular vote while winning the Electoral College to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Now that Joe Biden has won Pennsylvania, and the Presidency, all eyes are on the Electoral College. This is how it works, and how it will come into play in the 2020 race:

Number of Electoral College votes by state

Number of electors varies by state

The number of electors are based on a state’s congressional representation. For example –

Political parties choose the electors, who pledge to vote for their party’s candidate. Members of Congress and high-level federal employees are barred from being electors.

Breakdown of the Electoral College

Nov. 3: Election Day

The public casts ballots for presidential and vice presidential candidates. Though most ballots have only candidate names, voters actually choose groups of electors.

The candidate with the most overall popular votes gets all the electors. The exception: Maine and Nebraska, which can split electors among candidates.

Dec. 14: Electors cast ballots

Electors meet in their respective state capitals and vote. The results are sealed and sent to the president of the U.S. Senate – currently Vice President Mike Pence.

Jan. 3, 2021: New Congress is seated

Newly elected and current members of Congress are officially seated.

Jan. 6: Electoral votes are counted

Members of the House and Senate meet jointly for a formal count of electoral votes. The candidate with 270 votes is declared the winner.

Jan. 20: Inauguration Day

The winning presidential and vice presidential candidates take the oath of office.

The Electoral College has critics...

In recent years, the National Popular Vote movement has sought to replace the Electoral College, preferring the popular vote to choose presidents.

Detractors say the system has become more flawed because candidates can win the popular vote but still lose in the Electoral College.

This has happened five times in American history, most recently in Bush vs. Gore in 2000 and Trump vs. Clinton in 2016. It could happen again this year.

Critics claim it favors small-population states over larger ones and forces presidential campaigns to focus too heavily on battleground states or states that are possible wins for either party.

A Gallup poll in September showed 61% of American favored getting rid of the Electoral College.

...and supporters

The Electoral College as we know it has been part of American politics since 1804. Supporters say it's essential.

""The Electoral College was designed by the framers deliberately, like the rest of the Constitution, to counteract the worst human impulses and protect the nation from the dangers inherent in democracy,"" noted National Affairs in its fall 2020 edition.

Battleground states in 2020

Do electors have to vote for their party’s candidate?

They’re expected to, but sometimes don’t. “Faithless” electors have broken rank and voted for someone other than their candidate. Fairvote.org says 90 electors have cast “deviant” votes in the past 58 presidential elections. None affected the outcome.

Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have laws that mandate electors vote in accordance with the popular vote. The Supreme Court ruled July 6 that states can punish faithless electors who go rogue.

What happens if there’s a tie?

It’s possible, but extremely unlikely, that the Electoral College could deadlock 269-269. In that case, the newly elected House would vote on who becomes president. Each state gets one vote; 26 votes are needed to win. The Senate would decide who becomes vice president.

26,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/11/06/biden-growing-leads-key-states-closer-electoral-college-win/6191429002/,How Biden won: Victory in Pennsylvania put him past 270 electoral votes,"WASHINGTON — Democratic nominee Joe Biden surpassed 270 electoral votes and secured the race for president Saturday after Pennsylvania, where his lead keeps growing as more absentee ballots are counted, was finally called for the former vice president.

Biden clinched a victory in Nevada soon after, giving him 290 electoral votes. Georgia, where Biden now leads by more than 7,000 votes, is headed for a recount. If he wins it, Biden would finish with 306 electoral votes.

President Donald Trump has no more pathways to victory.

Biden, the president-elect, is the first candidate to defeat an incumbent president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. His running-mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, will become the first woman, African American and South Asian American vice president.

North Carolina, where Biden trails, remains uncalled as election officials prepare to count absentee ballots over the coming days. Alaska isn't called but is expected to go for Trump. Even if Trump were to win both, it would be not enough for the president.

The Associated Press and multiple news networks called Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes for Biden after his lead reached more than 30,000 votes, a large enough margin to withstand any more votes that could go to Trump. Biden's lead in Pennsylvania is expected to grow.

Not only do the remaining counties with uncounted absentee ballots in Pennsylvania lean left, but mail voting itself is more favored by Biden supporters. Pennsylvania also has to count about 100,000 provisional ballots, which historically lean Democratic.

After Trump's yearlong crusade against mail voting, the president's voters were reluctant to vote by mail while Biden supporters embraced the method because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden supporters dominated mail voting by a 2 to 1 margin nationally.

That's why Trump appeared ahead in several battleground states on election night, but the race shifted to Biden as mail-in ballots were counted.

Below is where the vote tallies stand in each state:

Here is a look at those same states laid out geographically:

Pennsylvania

Biden's lead in Pennsylvania is 34,501 electoral votes with 76,496 more absentee ballots, plus an additional 100,000 provisional ballots to count. Nearly half of the provisional ballots are in Democratic strongholds Philadelphia or Pittsburgh.

The Keystone State still has 124,000 more absentee ballots to count, but the overwhelming majority are expected to favor Biden.

Georgia

Biden currently leads Trump in Georgia by 7,264 votes with few absentee ballots still left to count.

There remain around 13,000 provisional ballots and some overseas and military ballots that could still arrive. The election outcome will be subject to a recount because the margin is less than .5%.

Nevada

In Nevada, Biden extended his lead over Trump to 25,659 ballots, enough for the Associated Press to call the state for Biden.

Democrat Hillary Clinton won Nevada four years ago. The outstanding mail-in ballots are expected to favor Biden.

North Carolina

Trump leads North Carolina over Biden by 76,737 votes. The outcome might not be final for another week as the Tar Heel State counts what could be more than 150,000 more absentee ballots. North Carolina's deadline for mail-in ballots to be received is Nov. 12 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

27,2020-10-28 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/28/covid-cases-us-sees-surge-americans-tire-pandemic/6052710002/,'There's no way to sugarcoat it': COVID-19 cases are surging; one American dies every 107 seconds,"The U.S. set a record this week for new coronavirus cases over a seven-day period with more than 500,000 infections. An American is testing positive every 1.2 seconds.

Daily deaths are also climbing – one of us is dying every 107 seconds, according to Johns Hopkins data.

And daily hospitalizations have been rising steadily for more than a month, from 28,608 on Sept. 20 to more than 44,000 on Tuesday.

""There's no way to sugarcoat it: We are facing an urgent crisis, and there is an imminent risk to you, your family members, your friends, your neighbors and the people you care about,"" said Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, whose state is seeing one of the nation's worst outbreaks.

As winter approaches, America is facing a crucial fork in the road, said Melissa Nolan, an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of South Carolina.

""We might see a larger surge due to the pandemic fatigue Americans are experiencing,"" Nolan told USA TODAY. ""Americans are tired of adhering to public health guidelines and getting tested.""

She repeated the familiar plea of public health experts: Masks. Social distancing. Hand washing. Risk mitigation strategies until a vaccine is developed.

While the White House’s science policy office ranked “ending the Covid-19 pandemic” among President Donald Trump's top achievements, the world isn't buying in. Stock markets around the globe fell sharply Wednesday amid investor fears that global lockdowns are once again on the horizon.

""We're well behind this virus,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's emergencies program, said this week. ""We will have to get ahead of this virus, and that may require sacrifice for many, many people in terms of their personal lives.""

Some suggest a national lockdown might allow a “reset” for states more severely affected to reduce their spiraling numbers, but that is unlikely to happen given the political climate, most experts agree.

""A national mandate from the federal government for universal masking is more likely to achieve the greatest impact to reduce deaths in the next several months,"" said Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

That's not very likely either, however.

Meanwhile, states like Wisconsin suffer. State officials there are urging residents to stay home and avoid social gatherings – despite a series of legal challenges that have frustrated efforts by Evers to order restrictions.

""It's a nightmare scenario, frankly, that this could get quite a bit worse in the next several weeks or months before it gets better,"" said Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

Experts say at least one vaccine candidate could win FDA approval by year's end. But that could just be the beginning of questions related to vaccinating a nation of more than 300 million people. And a world of more than 7 billion people.

Nolan warns that until it becomes clear what type of vaccine clears FDA guidelines for mass distribution, it won't be clear what problems the nation faces in getting it to the public. For example, some vaccines require refrigeration – and, because this is how the world works in 2020, it turns out we are nearing a national shortage of clinical laboratory refrigerators.

We still don't know how well any vaccines actually will work. And even if they do work, Americans must be convinced it is safe and effective before they line up to get the shot.

Vaccine update:Experts say securing a COVID-19 vaccine in record time could be easy, but distributing it won't be

Senior FDA career executives: We're following the science to protect public health in pandemic

Once the vaccine is available, ""uptake issues"" must be overcome, said Ogbonnaya Omenka, an associate professor and public health specialist at Butler University. Will the vaccine be mandatory or optional? And if mandatory, how will it be enforced ""in view of the clash between individual liberty and public health?""

Also, there are questions of prioritization: figuring out who should get the vaccine first because there won't be enough to go around for some time. Young, healthy people would seem to be last in line, but what effect will that have on in-classroom learning for students?

There is also evidence that vaccine hesitancy may be higher in minority communities, the communities that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic, said Dr. Anuj Mehta, a pulmonary and critical care physician at National Jewish Health in Denver.

""Convincing people that a vaccine is a safe and effective will be a critical part of widespread dissemination,"" Mehta said.

Trump, who recovered from COVID-19 earlier this month, continues to downplay the latest wave of infections.

""We're rounding the turn,"" the president said at recent campaign stop. ""We're doing great. Our numbers are incredible.""

Trump points to daily death totals, which, while rising, have not reached numbers seen in April, when thousands of Americans died each day. Glatter said deaths have not reached those numbers during this surge because of increased testing, more judicious use of intubation and noninvasive forms of ventilation, and use of steroids and the medication remdesivir when indicated.

The world is also struggling.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Wednesday that he has gone into quarantine. India is second only to the U.S. in reported infections, nearing the 8 million mark.

In Europe, several nations are weighing tougher restrictions. European Union officials on Wednesday urged the bloc’s 27 nations to introduce common rules to test for the disease and track its spread to help prevent further damage to their virus-battered economies.

“We are seeing a large number of cases, we are seeing widespread disease"" in Europe, Ryan said. ""We are seeing very, very high positivity rates and an increasing lack of capacity to do any effective form of contact tracing.""

He said stay-at-home orders may be needed in some countries to take the ""heat out of this phase of the pandemic.""

When will it all end? There are so many variables, it's not easy to say. Glatter said it will take three years.

Nolan went out on a limb: ""Next spring,"" she said.

Jenkins caught COVID-19 in April, and it almost killed him, he said. He and his wife, who was also infected, took to checking on each other at night to make sure the other was still breathing.

“It was really that bad,” said Jenkins, who was outraged by Trump's response to the pandemic. The ""Virus-45"" slogan on the T-shirt was a reference to Trump, the country's 45th president.

But COVID was not the only issue that drove Jenkins, of Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, to vote for Biden.

“President Trump was a virus for this country for the past four years,” Jenkins said. “He brings racism out into the light that obviously was always in the shadows, but he made it okay to be racist.”

In the closing stretch of the campaign, it seemed that COVID would define everything about the 2020 election.

""COVID, COVID, COVID.""

It was Trump's closing grievance of the 2020 campaign – a complaint that no matter how hard he tried to escape the pandemic, he couldn't seem to change the subject or the storyline.

But Tuesday's results tell a more nuanced story. Yes, COVID dominated the news, hobbled the economy and gripped the nation. By Election Day, it had killed more than 200,000 Americans, upended daily life and sent the president to the hospital.

The pandemic was foremost on voters' minds, according to a survey of the electorate conducted by the Associated Press. Four in 10 voters said it was the most important issue facing the country, by far the highest response to the question. Twenty-seven percent picked the economy, which has been battered by COVID restrictions on travel, dining out, movie-going and a slew of other activities.

Nearly all of those surveyed – 95% – said the federal government's response to the pandemic was a factor in deciding how they voted.

But it also divided Americans as with so many other issues, with the electorate split over how to confront a public health crisis that has also crippled the economy. Voters were torn in the face of a virus that has threatened their lives and livelihoods, according to a broad survey of voters by The Associated Press, called VoteCast.

When asked which should be the federal government's higher priority, 59% of VoteCast respondents said limiting the spread of the coronavirus, even if it damages the economy; 39% said limiting additional damage to the economy, even if it increases the spread of coronavirus. And while 77% of Biden supporters chose health over the economy, 86% of Trump voters chose the economy over health.

'Black cloud' of the election

""The pandemic is the black cloud hanging over this election,"" said David Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. ""It's everything.""

Still, John Feehery, a Republican consultant, said the pandemic did not lead to an exodus from the GOP, which stands a good chance of holding onto its majority in the Senate and gained seats in the House, where Democrats hold a majority.

""People don't want doom and gloom,"" he said. ""They want to get on with their lives.""

Trump embraced the notion that Americans were tired of hearing about COVID. He blasted the media for focusing heavily on the pandemic and its spiraling death toll. He insisted the United States was ""rounding the corner.""

He mocked mask wearing and flouted federal health guidelines by holding huge rallies with little to no social distancing.

""You turn on the news: COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID,"" Trump complained at a rally in south Florida on Sunday. He hinted he might fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, after the election.

Biden warns of 'dark winter'

Biden took the opposite approach, warning of a ""dark winter"" if Americans did not take the virus more seriously. He promised to empower scientific experts and tackle the crisis head-on. He kept a light campaign schedule, made sure his events were socially distanced and wore a mask everywhere, sometimes even two.

The day before the election, Biden accused Trump of failing to protect the country from the virus and said he was ""responsible for so many deaths.""

As for Trump's threat to fire Fauci, Biden offered this retort: ""I've got a better idea. ... I’m going hire Dr. Fauci. And we’re going to fire Donald Trump,"" he said.

As Trump and Biden's delivered dueling messages, the U.S. suffered a record-breaking new surge of infections: more than 500,000 new cases over a seven-day period, with deaths and hospitalizations climbing nationwide.

The day before the election, one American was dying every 107 seconds, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. As the vote count got under way, the U.S. hit a grim milestone: More than 100,000 new infections in a single day.

If voters needed any reminder of the pervasiveness of the virus, they got one when it hit the White House for a third time – with Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows contracting COVID along with several others others in Trump's orbit. Meadows' diagnosis came after an outbreak among Vice President Mike Pence's top advisers, which came after Trump's own bout of COVID.

And just days before the election came this jarring declaration from Meadows.

""We’re not going to control the pandemic,” Mark Meadows told CNN, sparking fierce blowback from critics who said it showed the Trump administration had given up on fighting the virus.

A majority of voters said they had more confidence in Biden to handle the coronavirus crisis than Trump. When asked which candidate they thought would be better able to handle the pandemic, 47% said Biden and 38% said Trump, the VoteCast data showed.

But according to the survey, more voters trusted Trump on the economy, 51% to 39%.

For Maanefero Xederu Roberts of Pennsylvania, the pandemic – and his belief that Trump botched its response – reinforced his decision to vote for Biden. A 25-year-old independent, Roberts works two jobs, one selling juice at a stand in York’s Central Market and another as a chef, and both businesses have been hurt by the pandemic.

""I come in here,"" he said at his stand in the market, ""and nobody's here. I work at the restaurant and I mostly cook for the waitresses.""

""They say the choice is between stopping the pandemic and opening up, one or the other,"" he added. ""When people give you an ultimatum, you're in a toxic relationship and it's time to get out.""

'COVID, COVID, COVID':Trump complains media too focused on pandemic

At the same time, some voters agreed with Trump's argument that lockdowns would wreck the economy – or as the president put it, the cure ""cannot be worse than the problem itself.""

“How it was handled, no matter who was put in that position they were going to be criticized,” said Nicole Morrison, a 29-year-old Floridian and registered Republican.

Morrison said she doesn’t believe masks do much to protect against the virus, and she wasn’t wearing one when she cast her vote for Trump two days before the election.

PPE for polling volunteers

As the pandemic weighed on voters minds, the virus also nixed election night parties, scaled back get-out-the-vote operations, caused a shortage in poll workers, and drove a tsunami of early and absentee voting.

At least 96 million Americans voted before Election Day, according to a tally by Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections.

As local election officials prepared to process a record number of mail-in ballots, they also had to search for bigger polling locations – to ensure voting booths were at least six feet apart. And they scrambled to provide volunteers with personal protective equipment.

Sherry Poland, director of elections in Hamilton County, Ohio, said she had a phalanx of ""sanitation technicians"" trained to clean voting booths between each use. The county has also invested in a stash of face shields, hand wipes, and other virus-killing supplies.

Alex Triantafilou, a member of the election commission and chairman of Hamilton County's Republican Party, said Ohio launched an ""all hands on deck"" effort to recruit new poll workers after many seniors bowed out.

Republican activists also had to adjust their campaign strategies, he said, with volunteers suspending door-knocking in the spring but then restarting in early July – albeit with COVID precautions so they didn't make voters uncomfortable.

""We did it safely. We did masks, We’d step back from the door,"" he said.

The election night festivities could not be salvaged, however, amid the virus surge.

""We were on the fence as to whether to have one,"" Triantafilou said, but decided against it amid the virus surge. The state Republican Party also opted for a virtual gathering instead of their usual ""blowout"" affair, he said.

Seniors largely stuck with Trump

Older voters helped catapult Trump to the White House in 2016. According to a Pew Research Center analysis, Trump won 51% of 50- to 64-year-old voters, compared to 45% who supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Among those over 65, Trump's advantage over Clinton was even greater – 53% to 44%.

Before the election, polls showed seniors drifting away from Trump, with older voters souring on him because of his handling of the pandemic. But while Biden did make inroads with seniors, he did not flip Trump's edge. Trump won 51% of older voters, while Biden snagged 48%, according to VoteCast. Even those small gains for Biden likely proved critical in battleground states.

""Seniors should have been a slam dunk for him,"" Cohen said of Trump. ""That ties right into the pandemic.""

Trump's campaign courted seniors with promises to drive down drug costs and other moves. But his dismissive rhetoric about the pandemic struck many older voters as cavalier and indifferent to their health and safety.

Andrea Figler, a retired 78-year-old voter in Pennsylvania, said Trump’s handling of COVID-19 was one factor driving her decision to vote for Biden. Figler, a retiree from Beaver County, said she believed Trump mishandled the pandemic by downplaying its risk and encouraging states to reopen before it was safe.

“Obviously coronavirus is the biggest issue right now,” she said. “Biden is, I think, someone who will listen to the experts and get it under control.""

COVID has taken a horrific toll on the elderly in America, with the virus raging through nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Eight out of every 10 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States were adults 65 years and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Biden tried to build on the shift with a massive ad blitz targeting older voters in battleground states.

“Our seniors that are being hit the hardest, they’re frightened,” Biden said in a spot that aired more than 9,000 times during the week ending Oct. 9. “I will not abandon you.""

Trump's campaign, by contrast, tried to use his own COVID diagnosis – and his recovery – as a selling point. In one spot, Trump is seen with his first raised as he emerges from Walter Reed Medical Center after his hospitalization.

""President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus and so is America,"" the narrator says. ""President Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should.""

It wasn't just seniors who said the pandemic was top-of-mind.

Maezie Kegrreis, a 21-year-old Florida voter who works in the technology sector, said she hasn’t been as personally affected by the pandemic. Days before Election Day, she told the USA TODAY Network that the virus would be a “big factor” in her decision.

Trump “could have been more proactive” in trying to contain the virus, she said, adding that she is eager to see him voted out of office. His response to the pandemic was “super telling for everyone,” she added, noting that everyone she knows is being very cautious and heeding public health recommendations about social distancing and wearing masks.

Shift among suburban women

In the 2016 election, Trump and Clinton essentially split the suburban vote, according to Pew, with Trump snagging 47% and Clinton garnering 45%.

This year, Biden won suburban women 59% to 40%, according to VoteCast.

Concerns about Trump's handling of the pandemic helped fuel that trend, but it was about much more.

Many women voters disapproved of the president's response to police violence against African Americans and the civil unrest that followed George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis. And they disliked his immigration policies that led to children being separated from their parents at the border.

Juli Evans grew up in the Cleveland suburbs and returned when she got married to raise a family. An independent who has voted for Republicans and Democrats for president, Evans says she has had enough of Trump and was backing Biden.

“I just can’t do four more years of Trump,” Evans said. “So many things he says are so fear-based, and I don’t want to live like that.""

Trump’s handling of racial tensions particularly concern her.

Evans, 53, has five children whose ages run from 13 to 25, including a daughter and two sons adopted from Ethiopia. They are among only a handful of Black residents in Bay, the suburb where they live.

“I have a multiracial family,” she said. “I adopted the boys 10 years ago and I never thought there would be an issue.""

More:My 'suburban mom' demographic is supposedly all in for Biden. But I'm voting for Trump.

Leslie Smith, who has lived in Bay, Ohio, for 47 years and has three adult children, voted for Trump in 2016 because of his pledge to make conservative appointments to the Supreme Court. And she was supporting him again this year, even though she doesn't like Trump's behavior or rhetoric.

“He makes it difficult. You don’t really want to be associated with the man because he is a bully, he’s an egotist and he can’t stop tweeting crazy stuff. Even if he does something good, he poops all over it with his tweets,” Smith said. “I’d like to put up a sign that says ‘I like his policies but I really can’t stand him.'''

For Jenkins, the Pennsylvania man who survived COVID, surviving ""Virus-45"" was even more important.

“We did cure it on Nov. 3. It’s done.” Jenkins said. As for his T-shirts, he's already trademarked his slogan – and at $20 a pop, they're going fast.

30,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/former-republican-representatives-urge-donald-trump-accept-election-results/6225752002/,31 former GOP House members urge Donald Trump to accept Joe Biden election win,"WASHINGTON — Thirty-one former Republican members of the U.S. House on Monday called on President Donald Trump to accept results of the 2020 election – and recognize that Democratic nominee Joe Biden won – as the vast majority of current Republican lawmakers side with the president's refusal to concede.

In a joint statement, the group of former Republican U.S. representatives said they believe statements from Trump, who has leveled baseless claims about voter fraud, are efforts to ""undermine the legitimacy of the election and are unacceptable.""

""Every vote should be counted and the final outcome accepted by the participants because public confidence in the outcome of our elections is a bedrock of our democracy,"" the statement reads. ""Going forward it is our hope the nation will, regardless of party or persuasion, recognize that President-Elect Joe Biden has won this election.""

How Biden won:How Joe Biden flipped the electoral map and won the presidency with room to spare

The group includes former House members who bucked their party and endorsed Biden during the campaign. Among them are former Reps. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.; Charles Djou, R-Hawaii.; and Susan Molinari, R-N.Y. Former Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo., who also endorsed Biden, issued the statement on behalf of his former colleagues.

Biden surpassed 270 electoral votes on Saturday to claim victory in the most bitterly fought presidential election in recent history. It came after media outlets called Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes to the former vice president after four days of counting absentee ballots put Biden ahead, erasing a lead Trump initially boasted about on election night that included mainly votes cast on Election Day.

Biden also narrowly won Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and has a lead of fewer than 11,000 votes in Georgia, which is still too close to call and the subject of a likely recount. Results aren't official until states certify them and electors cast their votes when the Electoral College meets Dec. 14.

Trump has not conceded. The Trump campaign has filed multiple lawsuits aimed at election results, including one in Pennsylvania that argues an ""illegal two-tiered voting system"" subjected in-person and mail-in voters to different rules. Attorney General Bill Barr announced he's authorized prosecutors to ""pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities"" despite little evidence of widespread voter fraud.

'Time to heal in America':President-elect Joe Biden, VP-elect Kamala Harris talk of unity

Only four Republican senators – Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – have congratulated Biden on winning. Others like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas have said the election had not been decided.

""The media doesn't determine election results,"" Cotton tweeted. ""Legal voters do. The same Dems who for 4 years refused to admit that Hillary lost now demand the President rush to concede. Nonsense. @realDonaldTrump has every right to pursue legal remedies and recounts. This is worth fighting for.""

Vice President Mike Pence also claimed in a tweet that the race isn't over.

""Told @VP Team Today, 'it ain’t over til it’s over.. and this AIN’T over!' President @realDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted!""

Although Collins offered her ""congratulations to President-elect Biden on his apparent victory,"" she also said Trump has the right to contest results.

""I understand that the president and others have questions about the results in certain states,"" Collins said. ""There is a process in place to challenge those results and, consistent with that process, the President should be afforded the opportunity to do so.""

In the House, the reaction was similar.

Some House Republicans said they would work with a Biden administration. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said Saturday on Twitter he was ""raising my hand and committing to working with President-elect Biden,"" and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, the longest-serving member of Congress, said despite his differences with Biden, ""It is time to put the election behind us, and come together to work for a better tomorrow for our nation.”

But others back the president's stance. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the top-ranking House Republican, said Sunday on Fox News the election was not over until every ""legal ballot was counted, recounts concluded, and litigation finished.""

Biden on Monday sought to move beyond the election and shift to transition as he announced a new advisory board that will help implement his plan to fight the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

""This election is over,"" Biden said. ""It's time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that's designed to demonize one another. It's time to end the politicization of basic responsible public health steps like mask-wearing and social distancing.""

Texas A&M put a pause on team activities after ""a couple of positive cases,"" coach Jimbo Fisher said.

In what coach Ed Orgeron called ""a very fluid situation,"" several players tested positive or are in quarantine as a result of contact tracing at LSU, leaving the upcoming rivalry game against Alabama in doubt.

Auburn and Mississippi State postponed Saturday's game ""due to positive tests and subsequent quarantining of individuals within the Mississippi State football program,"" the SEC said in a statement.

All of this during a two-hour span Monday afternoon.

That doesn't even include one of the biggest names in college basketball, Michigan State coach to Tom Izzo, testing positive, according to the school.

With cancellations thwarting the start of Pac-12 play and another run of bad news in the SEC, the past few days have been a harsh reminder of how fragile the home stretch of this regular season will be for college football.

""Everything about managing through the pandemic has been humbling,"" Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott told USA TODAY Sports. ""It’s a year where we’ve all had to shift our priorities and kind of readjust expectations.""

The setbacks plaguing college football are mirrored by the national increase in cases of COVID-19. There were 105,927 new cases of the coronavirus Sunday, continuing the troubling upswing since September, and all but one state had more cases last week than the week before.

In all, 50 games in the Bowl Subdivision have been cancelled or postponed due to COVID-19, with 13 coming since the start of November.

""It’s a numbers game,"" said Zach Binney, an epidemiologist at Oxford College of Emory University. ""The more cases we have in the country, the more likely anyone is to come into contact with somebody who is infected and therefore the more likely people are to come down with the virus.

""College football players are no exception. They are certainly not in a bubble like you’ve seen in some of the pro sports leagues, so if you’re still interacting with the broader community, including the campus community, the more cases that there are in that community the more that are going to pop up on your team.

""Football, as much as it would like to believe so, is not special in that regard.""

The Pac-12 tripped into the regular season this past Saturday with two cancellations and serious questions about the state of affairs across the conference, especially given the lack of open weeks to reschedule games before the end of the regular season.

Utah's opener against Arizona was canceled after multiple positive results for COVID-19 left the Utes short of the 53-scholarship threshold set by the conference. Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said Monday that one player who had contracted the coronavirus ""had a tough go of it"" and was hospitalized.

Due to safety protocols outlined by local health officials, a single positive test forced California to cancel its opener against Washington and has left Saturday's matchup with Arizona State in doubt — the guidelines require a 14-day quarantine period for those who test positive and those who are then placed into contact tracing.

""What we’ve asked for is the criteria,"" California coach Justin Wilcox said. ""If there’s new information, we’d love to have it.""

Monday's rash of developments in the SEC will have a noticeable influence on the race for the conference and the College Football Playoff.

LSU and Florida had already postponed October's meeting to Dec. 12, leaving the Tigers without an open date to move Alabama should the two be unable to play Saturday. (The rivalry has been held in every season since 1964.) That Florida has a game scheduled for Dec. 12 can be viewed as a disadvantage — if the Gators end up reaching the SEC championship game on Dec. 19, they'd face an opponent in Alabama coming off a bye week.

Any missed games would have a deep impact on Texas A&M's push for the playoff. Having already lost to Alabama, the Aggies' best chance at finishing in the top four is to win out in style against the rest of the SEC schedule. Playing even one fewer game would diminish the number of data points presented to the playoff selection committee and impact the Aggies' overall strength of schedule.

The question that perplexed administrators and onlookers this summer has resurfaced: Will the FBS be able to wade through cancellations and postponements to cross the finish line?

Over in the Big Ten, Wisconsin has been forced to cancel games against Purdue and Nebraska and is in danger of falling under the minimum number of games required to be eligible for the conference championship, though the university has projected confidence the Badgers would be able to play this weekend's game against Michigan.

But confidence is no match for the coronavirus. As the year rounds the midway point and heads toward December, the only certainty in college football is uncertainty.

""We don't have those issues right now,"" Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. ""But that can change tomorrow."""

Despite a surge in COVID-19 cases — the seven-day rate on campus alone soared from 18.9 cases to 30.7 cases in one week — Notre Dame treated its Saturday night showdown against top-ranked Clemson as if it was a run-of-the-mill game against Navy. Most of the 11,000-plus in the stands were students, despite athletic director Jack Swarbrick acknowledging after the fact that keeping them in their seats was never going to happen and Notre Dame making little effort to even try.

""Our philosophy of giving our preference to attend the game to students results in a very different dynamic than all the other places we go, where they allocated them to traditional fans. Those people will sit in their assigned seats without exception. Our students are going to move around more. They just are,"" Swarbrick told the South Bend Tribune on Sunday.

Worse, Swarbrick seemed largely unbothered by the students who rushed the field after the double-overtime victory, turning Notre Dame Stadium into a potential petri dish for the coronavirus. Kids will be kids and all that. Swarbrick even did it when he was a student.

Never mind that the world wasn’t overrun with a highly contagious virus back then.

The Rev. John Jenkins, university president, did give students a stern talking to Sunday night, saying it was ""very disappointing"" to see Notre Dame’s health protocols be ignored and promising ""zero tolerance"" for any future violations.

Good message, though it would have been more effective had it been said before the game. And been said by anyone besides Father Super Spreader, who lost his right to scold anyone on responsible behavior during a pandemic with his visit to the Rose Garden where he was suspected to have been infected by the coronavirus, among other attendees.

PLAYOFF PICTURE:Where the College Football Playoff stands after Week 10

RE-RANK 1-128:Alabama takes over at No. 1 and Notre Dame rises to No. 2

Easy as it is to pick on Notre Dame, its wholly predictable fiasco needs to be a teachable lesson to everyone else. COVID-19 is not going to magically disappear. Just the opposite, in fact. The United States surpassed 10 million cases Monday, we are closing in on 240,000 deaths and President-elect Joe Biden warned of a ""very dark winter.""

With 50 games canceled or postponed since the start of the season, including 13 just since Nov. 1, it is time to reconsider this college football season. Should fans be allowed to attend games? Should the games even be played?

Unlike the NFL, where teams can largely isolate themselves and six- and nine-figure contracts give players heavy incentive to adhere to protocols, college football is at the mercy of its surroundings. When cases are rising in the surrounding community, it’s inevitable a team will soon see the same.

A team can test every day and have rigorous contact tracing, and it is still going to be vulnerable to an outbreak. There are simply too many people from the ""outside"" — dozens, if not hundreds — who have daily interaction with players and coaches to keep the virus at bay.

At the very least, we shouldn’t be having fans at games.

Whether it’s students who can’t be trusted to stay in their seats and socially distance — even before the field was rushed, parts of Notre Dame’s student section looked like a mosh pit — or adults lining up outside stadiums and bathrooms, these games are not helping contain the fast-moving spread of the virus. There are too many people who still don’t wear masks properly and doubt the seriousness of COVID-19, and all it takes is one of them to cause an outbreak.

Having fans at night games, when inhibitions and common sense are in short supply after a day of ""pre-gaming,"" only increases the risk.

This isn’t enjoyable for any of us. We all want our old lives and sense of normalcy back. But we’re not there yet, not anywhere close.

And every time someone acts as irresponsibly as everyone at Notre Dame did last weekend, the further off it is.

This isn't forever. Pfizer's announcement Monday that its vaccine is proving more than 90% effective against COVID means we could be back to normal before next football season.

In the meantime, a good dose of common sense is necessary. Both from fans expected to follow the rules and the folks who make them.

33,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/christinebrennan/2020/11/09/masters-week-change-augusta-national-golf-club/6228106002/,Opinion: Change is in the air at Augusta National during Masters week in November,"AUGUSTA, Ga. – The eyes of the sports world turn south this week to the strangest of all mismatches between time and place during this pandemic. The Masters, that iconic harbinger of spring, now serves as a prelude to Thanksgiving. This is indeed a tradition unlike any other.

There will be no azaleas in bloom at the 2020 Masters. There will be no roars erupting around the course. There will be no gallery ropes, because there will be no galleries. The April pastels are long gone, replaced by the overwhelming presence of pine green, with just a smattering of autumn orange, yellow and red.

The strangeness of it all sinks in on a walk around the hallowed and hushed grounds during Monday’s practice round. You find yourself wondering: Where is everyone? You know the holes by heart, but the place looks different without boundaries. When the fairways and greens are not guarded by ropes and armies of volunteers, one can easily wander here and there, so you watch your step lest you end up marching into a fairway when a tee shot might be on its way right to you.

Then comes a revelation. This will be the first time the world has ever laid eyes on Augusta National Golf Club at any time other than April. (The PGA Seniors’ Championship was played here in November 1937 and again in December 1938, but of course there was no television back then.)

This private club has lived a secret life for decades except for one week a year, when it becomes the very public face of golf. We know it so well in the spring. We know it not at all the other 51 weeks of the year.

What other sports venue is so reclusive? Wimbledon, perhaps, but even it hosted the 2012 Olympic tennis tournament outside of its usual spot on the calendar. We’ve seen the Rose Bowl many times other than New Year’s Day, the U.S. women’s soccer team’s victory in the 1999 Women’s World Cup coming immediately to mind. Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have hosted football and hockey games outside of their traditional baseball seasons.

But Augusta National? Other than those early days of April, who knows what lurks beyond those elusive gates? Not us – until now.

Any exploration must head right to the heart of Amen Corner, the venerable spot where the 11th green, 12th hole and 13th tee meet, as famous an intersection as there is in sports.

On the walk over, a splash of color appears on the left side of the 11th fairway: a tree in blazing red beside another drenched in orange. South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen, taking practice swings, is silhouetted against this autumnal backdrop. One can only imagine how many times TV producers will try to capture that scene when the tournament begins.

Then comes the tee box on the famous par-3 12th hole. How different it looks without several hundred chairs lined up on the hillside. It appears simpler, uncluttered. It’s like a very familiar movie set, suddenly looking completely different from how you remember it.

Most of all, you notice the quietness of the place, and know what’s missing when there are no ropes, replaced this year by spray-painted dotted lines in the grass. It’s the spectators. The Masters will have none of its traditional and beloved roars this year, the sounds of silence most noticeable on Sunday.

“There’s no doubt the missing galleries is going to be the biggest difference,” said 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott.

Change is in the air at the 2020 Masters. Club chairman Fred Ridley announced Monday that Lee Elder, who became the first Black man to play in the Masters in 1975, will be an honorary starter with Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player at the 2021 Masters. The club also announced it will fund a women’s golf program at Paine College, an historically Black college in Augusta, while also endowing scholarships in Elder's name to Paine's men's and future women's golfers.

“I think like all organizations, we’ve been moved by the events of 2020,” Ridley said. “There's been a lot said about racial justice and opportunity, and our question was not so much what can we say but what can we do.”

That's Augusta National, so traditional, now changed by this extraordinary year."

Backstreet Boy AJ McLean can't find anybody to love his Queen tribute waltz, gets voted off","The dancing and the outfits were legendary for Icons Night on ""Dancing With the Stars"" Monday – not to mention the return, in ballroom tributes, of late-great stars Freddie Mercury, Amy Winehouse and even rapper Tupac Shakur.

The show, now down to seven power-contestants, showed some flab as judges and host Tyra Banks verbally tap danced to fill two hours, even snuffing the fun out of lively dance-offs.

But the drama kicked into overdrive for the furious finale, after beloved Backstreet Boy AJ McLean stumbled during his Queen tribute dance. He ultimately was voted off the show. The shock and dance floor horror were palpable, even in a COVID-19 empty ballroom.

Here's what the heck happened.

Last week's 'DWTS' drama: Jeannie Mai details her health emergency on 'DWTS,' this celeb is sent packing

Justina Machado doesn't express herself enough in her Madonna rumba

The ""One Day at a Time"" dance phenom had the Material girl outfit and the Madonna hair for her rumba to Madonna's ""Crazy for You"" with pro Sasha Farber. But she slid a little too gracefully (perhaps boringly) across the dance floor to make the judges happy. They wanted a little more Madonna flare in the tribute.

Judge Bruno Tonioli called it ""beautiful"" but said it showed ""the gentle side of Madonna. Nothing shocking."" He urged Machado to ""push it a bit further"" for the semifinals. The judges gave straight 8 scores. (Total score 26/30 after Machado won bonus points for a dance-off win.)

Nelly brings Tupac and flips to the 'DWTS' floor

Those who never thought Tupac Shakur – likely including the late rapper himself – would end up on ""Dancing With the Stars,"" never foresaw rapper Nelly excelling on the reality ballroom dance show. Nelly danced a joyful jazz Tupac tribute with pro Daniella Karagach to ""California Love."" There were flips, great moves, a constant smile, but some noticeable miscues. ""That's how you do it,"" Banks exclaimed as the dance ended. Judge Derek Hough praised the unusual ""journey"" that Nelly is taking. ""There were a few missed steps, but it was really good fun.""

The judges were on board, giving straight 8s. Nelly later valiantly tried to earn bonus points by ripping off his shirt during the salsa dance-off against Skai Jackson. He didn't win the points, but he definitely won some hearts (and perhaps viewer votes) with his serious beefcake. (Total score: 24/30)

Kaitlyn Bristowe unleashes her toxic, saucy Britney Spears

""The Bachelorette"" star Bristowe vowed to show a different side in her Argentine tango to ""Toxic"" with pro Artem Chigvintsev, a tribute to Spears. In her revealing sheer dress, suitable for TV audiences due to a series of strategically placed sparkles, she moved passionately and perfectly across the dance floor.

""Hit me Kaitlyn one more time,"" bellowed Tonioli. ""Some of the images were like a precious painting you could only see in a museum. A star performance."" Bristowe scored perfect 10s from all judges. (Total score: 30/30)

The judges wig out over Johnny Weir's Amy Winehouse quickstep

Judge Carrie Ann Inaba said that in 29 seasons of ""Dancing With the Stars"" she had never seen anything like Olympic figure skater Weir's tribute to the doomed singer – right down the signature mascara and hair. His quickstep to Winehouse's ""Valerie"" with pro Britt Stewart was passionate, precise even breathtaking – and never shook his perfectly placed Winehouse beehive wig.

""Amy would loved that,"" said Tonioli, who called it ""unique and groundbreaking"" and praised the perfect dancing. All judges raved with straight 10s. (Total score 30/30)

Skai Jackson gives a nasty paso doble tribute to Janet Jackson

Disney star Jackson was all grown up giving a passionate pre-dance video talk about speak out against racism, then hitting the dance floor and nailing her paso doble to ""If"" by her hero, Janet Jackson, with pro Alan Bersten. During the routine, Bersten spun the horizontal Jackson around the floor like a hypnotizing top, and the actress had the control to stop the head-spinning maneuver on a dime.

A proud Inaba had her mouth open in shock at the end, thanking Jackson for her words and for ""giving us this fierce paso doble."" She gave a 9, matched by the other judges. (Total score: 29/30 after Jackson beat out rapper Nelly in a dance-off for two bonus points.)

Nev Schulman proves Monday night is all right for dancing

Schulman brought the theatrics to his Elton John tribute jive to ""Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)"" with pro Jenna Johnson, along with the sparkly glasses and an outrageous yellow suit. The smile never left his face as he high kicked, and he even had the dexterity to allow Johnson to slide through his legs in one fluid move.

""Rocket Man at his most entertaining,"" said Tonioli, who had issues with the kicks. Each of the judges had like complaints, yet they gave straight 9 scores. (Total score 27/30)

AJ McLean is dethroned with his Queen tribute waltz

Backstreet Boy McLean started his Viennese Waltz tribute to Queen legend Freddie Mercury with pro Cheryl Burke in royal style – throwing off a grand rock 'n' roll, fur-collared robe and striding gracefully down stairs to Queen's ""Somebody to Love."" You couldn't ask for a better opening.

That's where it turned bad, with missed steps, missed turns. Heck, he missed everything. McLean, with a look of barely contained horror in his eyes, never recovered. He paid the price, proving that the most heavily favored star can south in one bad night of dancing.

""OK, that was a tough one,"" said Inaba, who gave a 7. ""It started off strong. Did you lose the turn, then lose the choreography? It was a bad series of events.""

""That first image, rock royalty,"" said Tonioli. ""So Freddie! You were so pumped up, you got yourself into a jumble."" He gave an 8. The scores were surprisingly gentle, all things considered. But the couple were at the bottom and in mortal peril even after McLean won his dance-off against Weir for two bonus points. (Total score 25/30)

The writing was on the wall …

In the moment of truth, the saved star couples frolicked off the stage to prepare for next week's semifinal leaving Weir and McLean in peril.

Two of the shows most popular dancers, only one could remain. The judges' usual hand-wringing over the power decision was sincere.

Tonioli voted for Weir to stay, Hough voted for McLean. Inaba was left with the deciding, Solomon-like vote.

""This is hard, you are both icons. I love you both and respect you both,"" said Inaba. But she voted for Weir to stay.

McLean was voted off, but he smiled and gave a classy exit. ""This has been one hell of a ride,"" McLean said."

Less than three months after co-creator Joe Ruby died in August, his counterpart Ken Spears died from complications related to Lewy body dementia on Friday, his son Kevin confirmed to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. Spears was 82.

Ken Spears’ son, Kevin, confirmed to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter that the legendary writer died from complications related to Lewy body dementia on Friday at the age of 82.

""Ken will forever be remembered for his wit, his story-telling, his loyalty to family, and his strong work ethic,"" Kevin said in a statement to the media outlets.

Blues,"" was played over the sound system.

""I don't worry/ Whenever skies are gray above/ Got a pocketful of rainbows/ Got a heart full of love...""

The sentiment was appropriately upbeat, but a selection from a film Elvis made the following year, ""Blue Hawaii,"" might have been more prescient: Miss Teen USA 2020 — crowned after a roughly 90-minute ceremony inside a socially distanced Soundstage at Graceland — is Ki'ilani Arruda, representing Hawaii.

A self-described ""island girl,"" Arruda was the second Miss Hawaii Teen USA to win the title. The first, in 1985, was Kelly Hu, who went on the play a supervillain, Lady Deathstrike, in the second ""X-Men"" movie, ""X2: X-Men United.""

Arruda has less glamorous plans: She hopes to become a dermatologist, according to a biography supplied by the Miss Universe Organization, which produces Miss Universe, Miss USA, and the latter's ""little sister"" pageant (to again make an Elvis allusion), Miss Teen USA.

To that end, Arruda is currently a freshman at the University of Puget Sound, studying molecular and cellular biology. Growing up on the ""Garden Island"" of Kaua’i, Arruda also is an advocate for autism awareness. (The subject is close to her heart because she has an autistic younger brother.)

Unlike the previous evening's protracted Miss USA and Miss Teen USA preliminary competitions, which required all 102 contestants to model active and evening wear for the judges at the Soundstage, Saturday's Miss Teen USA pageant supplied plenty of Memphis and Graceland tourism promotion to the home viewers — including many overseas — who watched the livestreamed pageant on the Miss USA Facebook page and other social media channels.

Shown on the Soundstage's video screens, a humorous TikTok montage showcased the girls — who have been based week at the hotel adjacent to the Presley mansion, The Guesthouse at Graceland — striking Elvis poses in Elvis jumpsuits, scored to a remixed version of the Presley song ""Bossa Nova Baby.""

Pageant hosts Cheslie Kryst (the reigning Miss USA 2019) and Allie LaForce (Miss Teen USA 2005 and an ""NBA on TNT"" reporter) and such special guests as the current Miss Universe, Zozi Tunzi of South Africa, and the current Miss Teen USA, Kaliegh Garris, touted the host city.

""A special shout-out to Memphis, one of the greatest and also safest places to host a production,"" LaForce said. Garris, meanwhile, said she especially appreciated visiting the National Civil Rights Museum. ""I think Memphis is just filled with history,"" she said, adding that she appreciated learning about ""everything that got us where we are today.""

When Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart took the stage, Kryst asked her: ""What do you love about this magical city?""

""We have had a great event here,"" Shugart replied. ""Their safety protocols and everything is amazing.""

The 16 Miss Teen USA finalists announced near the start of the show included two Tri-State representatives, Anna Claire Hay, from Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and ""hometown girl"" (in the words of the host) Ansley Ecker, a Munford High School graduate who plans to major in physical therapy at the University of Memphis.

However, neither girl made it from the pool of 16 finalists into the Top Five list that preceded the announcement that Miss Teen USA Hawaii was the new Miss Teen USA. Miss Oregon Teen USA Shayla Montgomery was first runner-up, while Miss Georgia Teen USA Shayla Jackson was second runner-up.

Although no candidate was endorsed, the recent presidential election was referred to frequently if obliquely, with many of the contestants mentioning that they turned 18 this year, and so were able to vote. Said LaForce: ""It's so great to see the young women doing their civic duty and voting for the first time in their lives.""

But the evening's pervasive theme was the COVID-19 pandemic, which had curtailed the contestants' schedules and kept them largely confined to the Graceland campus, where they have been tested daily for the coronavirus since arriving in Memphis early this week.

In a startling visual reminder of the pandemic, the young women wore masks when they returned to the stage en masse near the end of the show, for the announcement of the winner. The black masks that obscured their typically beaming smiles provided a stark contrast to the bright colors of their glittering gowns, the painstaking preparation of their coiffures, and the signature pageant sashes emblazoned in bold red letters with their state names.

With the Miss Teen USA contest now in the record books, Graceland next will host the week's most significant pageant event: Miss USA. The show airs live at 7 p.m. Monday on the FYI cable channel. LaForce will again host, this time joined by professional football player turned television personality Akbar Gbaja-Biamila."

While there's renewed hope that Congress may pass more coronavirus relief this year now that the presidential election is over, the bill could be smaller if Republicans keep control the Senate even though Democrat Joe Biden has captured the presidency, experts say.

“A divided government, with Democrats controlling the White House and Republicans the Senate, is likely to mean a smaller fiscal stimulus package than had been anticipated,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note.

Trump or Biden:Who would boost growth, restore jobs faster? Here’s an Election Day guide on the economy

'It's certainly going to get worse': Businesses plan more layoffs, hiring freezes as COVID-19 escalates

To be sure, control of the Senate by Republicans is still not a certainty, even if indications lean that way. A Democratic sweep looks unlikely, although a runoff election for two Georgia Senate seats in January keeps the race alive.

House Democrats are targeting a $2.2 trillion package. Senate Republicans introduced a smaller $500 billion spending package that included aid for small businesses and federal unemployment benefits. But Democrats blocked it after the measure omitted $1,200 stimulus checks and aid for states.

UBS analysts expect a deal of up to $1 trillion, down from a $2 trillion stimulus package that was expected if the Democrats had captured a majority in the Senate.

The aid, however, is likely to include the elements that are essential to the recovery, including increased unemployment benefits and additional funds for struggling small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program, UBS analysts said.

It's unclear if the next package would include stimulus checks.

Economists have been clamoring for a renewal of stimulus since the expiration in late July of the last round of supplemental benefits for laid-off workers and other support approved earlier by Congress.

A divided government could also further impede an agreement on a fresh infusion of aid for the economy.

“Americans are suffering. The longer Congress waits on passing a stimulus package, the more small businesses will go bankrupt, and people won’t have the ability to make their rent or mortgage payments,” says Ken Moraif, senior adviser at Retirement Planners of America, a financial consultant.

“We’ll start to see systemic damage to the economy and see permanent unemployment grow even further,” Moraif adds.

In October, the ranks of workers permanently laid off dipped from 3.8 million to 3.7 million, according to the Labor Department. The figure had been steadily rising as employers cut ties with a growing share of the workers they had furloughed.

Unemployment benefits:Racial disparity in jobless aid grows as Congress stalls on COVID-19 stimulus

'I will be put out of my house':Some Americans who struggled early in crisis are on brink, others find jobs

A number of analysts are concerned that some Republicans will have little incentive to push a package through during a lame-duck session at the end of 2020. That said, some Republican officials have signaled they want to strike a deal before the end of the year.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supported Congress passing a new stimulus package before the end of the year instead of January, as he previously stated. The Senate returns from recess Monday.

""I think we need to do it and I think we need to do it before the end of the year,"" McConnell said in a news conference on Wednesday. ""I think now that the election's over, the need is there and we need to sit down and work this out.""

Then on Friday, McConnell said Congress should enact a smaller stimulus package since a drop in the unemployment rate to 6.9% last month, along with other indications of economic growth signaled that the U.S. economy was in a recovery.

“I think it reinforces the argument that I’ve been making for the last few months, that something smaller – rather than throwing another $3 trillion at this issue – is more appropriate,” McConnell told reporters, according to Reuters.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected his call for a narrow bill. She has been working with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to strike a deal near $2 trillion.

“It doesn’t appeal to me at all, because they still have not agreed to crush the virus. If you don’t crush the virus, we’re still going to have to be dealing with the consequences of the virus,” Pelosi said in a news conference.

Still, some analysts are concerned about the viability of a stimulus package after both parties failed to strike a deal in recent months.

“There’s going to be a lot of hard feelings between Republicans and Democrats coming out of this election,” says Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridian, a registered investment adviser. “If things are more of the same in Congress, does that mean we’ll continue to have a stalemate with the stimulus package?""

Several European governments are bringing back restrictions on businesses in hopes of stemming surging cases of the virus. In the United States, where infections are also rising at a troubling rate, the worry is that fear alone could depress sales for companies, leading to further layoffs.

""The economy will need an additional round of stimulus early next year. We’re already seeing modest lockdowns in Europe,"" Mies says. ""State by state, there could be more restrictions of what people could do, and as a result, there will be more unemployment issues."""

And the teeny Mini looks and feels like an iPhone from years ago, before they started growing in size.

An early look at the devices, which go on sale Friday morning, reveals much that will clearly appeal to iPhone fans. The small form factor of the Mini will be applauded by people who thought the iPhones had gotten just too big, while the Max will take some getting used to. It's that huge.

Apple initially released two new iPhones in October, the 12 and 12 Pro, selling for $799 and $999. The second waves of phones caps off Apple's year with Friday's release of the Mini at $699, and the Max starting at $1,099, the same price as last year's iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Macs:Apple set to debut faster MacBooks powered by iPhone chips during Tuesday online event

Updates:More iPhone 12s? Get ready for iPhone 12 Pro Max, plus the Xbox, PS5 and HomePod Mini

The iPhone 12 Pro Max touts camera features not found on other phones, including a bigger zoom lens and image pixels, better image stabilization for photos and videos and what Apple says is superior performance in low light. It's being marketed as the ultimate iPhone for photographers and general camera nerds.

The iPhone SE is still Apple's most economical phone, starting at $399. But if you have the extra $300, you get a lot more phone with the Mini.

The Mini has two camera lenses, a wide and ultra-wide, compared to just one for the SE, the faster A14 Apple processor, higher resolution screen (2340x1080 versus 1334x750) and more importantly, the new improved glass that Apple touts as being four times less likely to break.

Both phones come with 64 GB of storage, which won't last you very long in a world of higher-resolution photos and videos and apps that eat at a lot of our storage. The Mini costs $749 with 128 GB of storage, compared to $449 for the SE with 128 GB.

The Max is the largest iPhone ever for Apple, with that huge 6.7-inch screen. The new iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models are both 6.1 inch. Last year's iPhone 11 Pro Max was 6.5 inches.

The Max compares to Samsung's Note S20 and S20 Ultra, which is even larger, with a 6.9-inch screen.

But how does it feel to hold the Max in your hand? Odd. It will take some getting used to. It's bigger than your palm and could stick out of your pocket. But I look forward to exploring it more, and will have a full review shortly.

One thing worth pondering: It's so large, who needs an iPad anymore? Videos on YouTube and Netflix look incredible on the Max, and this is the phone that would make a great airplane riding companion for viewing and reading.

Meanwhile, camera nerd alert: the zoom lens on the Max is a heftier 65mm, compared to 52mm on the 12 Pro, which means you get a lot closer to the action with the Max. More to come. Stay tuned.

You can see the difference below in the images of my cat, Jinx II, shot at Max full telephoto (65mm) on top, and full telephoto on the iPhone 12 Pro, at 52mm.

The two new phones are available for pre-order, but Apple is backlogged on deliveries. Apple's website says the Max is back-ordered through Dec. 1 to 8, while the Mini deliveries are delayed until Nov. 24 to 27.

Global financial markets also got a boost following Democrat Joe Biden’s defeat of incumbent Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election over the weekend. Wall Street followed, seeming relieved that the limbo created by the long, market-bruising battle for the White House was finally ending.

The Dow Jones industrial average vaulted up as much as 1,610 points to a new intraday high of 29,933.83, topping its previous record on Feb. 12 before the pandemic rattled financial markets around the world. The blue-chip average, however, lost steam near the close and ended the day up 834.57 points, or 3%, to 29,157.97, its biggest percentage gain since June.

The S&P 500 index, the heart of many 401(k) accounts, jumped 1.2% to 3550.50, finishing just below its Sept. 2 record. It notched its best day since Thursday when stocks were buoyed by prospects that more gridlock in Washington would prevent Democrats from pushing through stiffer regulations and higher taxes. The broad index had posted its best week since April on Friday following an election-fueled rally.

Stocks staged a stunning turnaround propelled by Big Tech over the summer as trillions of dollars in stimulus aid from the Federal Reserve and Congress helped support an American economy gripped by recession. Despite recent volatility on a spike in coronavirus cases, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 60% since hitting its March 23 low after the shutdown brought the global economy to a near standstill in the spring.

Industries tied to the possibility of the economy reopening, including airlines, casino and restaurant companies, rallied following the vaccine news. High-flying technology shares that have thrived in a stay-at-home economy fell. That kept a lid on the gains for the Nasdaq Composite, which fell 1.5% to 11,713.78.

With the stock market back near record highs, investors who sat on the sidelines during the turbulence of 2020 would have lost out on gains.

If an investor had put $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund on Dec. 31, 2019, it would have been worth roughly $11,335.84 with dividends through Friday’s close, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at financial-research company CFRA.

Investors shouldn’t try to time events, but rather invest for the long haul, analysts say.

“Time, not timing, makes money in the markets. There was little question that an effective vaccine will come to market,” Michael Farr, president of the money management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, said in a note.

“What does an investor do now? Be patient, stay diversified, don't get emotional. It makes a difference,” Farr added.

Global markets were buoyed on Monday after Pfizer and German partner BioNTech released early study results Monday indicating that their vaccine, BNT162b2, prevented more than 90% of infections from the virus that causes COVID-19.

Pfizer is the first drug company to release data from a large, Phase 3 trial as it and several other companies are working to produce a COVID-19 vaccine that is safe and effective. Shares rallied 7.7%.

Still, analysts caution that several risks remain that could trip up the market’s big recent gains. Any economic recovery depends on checking the pandemic, and investors pounced upon the news. Pfizer’s data is only preliminary and does not mean a vaccine is imminent. Getting the vaccine to billions of people will be a massive undertaking, even if it is approved.

“For the first time we can see a light at the end of the tunnel and a return to ‘normalcy’ seems likely within 2021,” Steven Seedhouse, an analyst at Raymond James, said in a note. “It all depends on scaling manufacturing for this and subsequent vaccines that we expect to work.”

The vaccine news comes as the country’s new coronavirus cases are setting records once again. The U.S. recorded 126,742 cases Saturday, the third day in a row the total exceeded 120,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins. The United States, with about 4.3% of the world population, has about 20% of the cases.

Global markets were jolted higher in Asia and Europe overnight as investors breathed a sigh of relief after days of U.S. presidential limbo ended with Biden declared the president-elect. Stocks had rallied last week on the prospect for more gridlock in Washington.

The upside of a split Congress for markets is that it may prevent Democrats from approving some of the measures investors feared, such as higher tax rates and tougher antitrust policies for big technology companies.

“The election outcome is arguably the most favorable scenario for investors. A split congress or even a blue sweep with a very marginal majority implies that neither large tax hikes nor major changes in regulation are likely,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in a note.

Many analysts expect trade tensions to de-escalate under a Biden presidency. Still, not all trade tensions are expected to vanish even if Biden rolls back some of the tariffs imposed by Trump on U.S. trading partners, especially China, in the past several years.

On Monday, a 11.6% surge for Chevron and a nearly 12% jump for Disney amid hopes that people will start driving and flying to theme parks again helped drive the Dow's gains.

Cruise operators, airlines and mall owners were also among the market’s biggest winners. Carnival surged 39%, though it’s still down by more than half for 2020 so far. Delta Air Lines surged 17% and Las Vegas Sands jumped 9%.

The Big Tech companies that drove the market higher earlier in the pandemic, in large part because they didn’t need a “normal” economy to succeed, were lagging behind.

Zoom Video slumped 17%. Netflix and Amazon fell 8.6% and 5.1%, respectively.

“We want to go back to work, school and socializing in business and family life and this means a slow down for most stay-at-home stocks,” James McDonald, CEO and chief investment officer of investment manager Hercules Investments, said in a note. “Stocks like Zoom and Netflix will be long-term winners, but will lose in the short-term as their valuations ran ahead of actual earnings.”

Treasury yields and oil prices burst higher as the vaccine news allows investors to feel confident about a stronger economic recovery on the way. The yield on the 10-year Treasury shot up from 0.81% before the announcement to 0.95%, a very big move for the bond market and one that shows stronger confidence in the economy. The key rate touched its highest level since March earlier in the morning, according to Tradeweb.

U.S. oil jumped 8.3%.

Stock markets across Europe jumped more than 4%. In Asia, many markets rose more than 1%.

Special to USA TODAY

Between the global pandemic and possible financial uncertainty going into the new year, many Americans will be trading their annual holiday getaway for a ""staycation.""

The good news is you can, in fact, have a great time at home this fall and winter, while keeping the family engaged and entertained. Best of all, you don't need to break the bank.

If you're home for the holidays, the following are a few suggestions to getting the most out of it, with a handful of thrifty tips to help you do more with less.

Cut the cord already

As USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham has covered in depth, providing a defense for cheap TVs and comparing different streaming services for their value, millions of people are saving money by finally ditching cable.

► There are several streamers to choose from, and if you pick only a couple – such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, or Disney+ and Apple TV+ – it’s still considerably less than a monthly cable package, which can be well over $200 a month.

Among Alexa's lesser-known abilities:You can ask the digital assistant about COVID-19 symptoms

New phones:iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max begin preorders Friday, both expected to be in short supply

► Also, consider AVOD services, which stands for ""ad-supported video on demand."" Some of the more popular options include: Vudu, Tubi and IMDb TV, as well as YouTube, Crackle and Popcornflix – each of them offering thousands of TV show episodes and movies. You just need Wi-Fi and a device to watch it on.

► If you want to turn your regular TV into a smart one, and significantly enhance its audio at the same time, Roku just launched its aptly named Streambar ($129). Simply connect the included HDMI cable and join your Wi-Fi to begin streaming content in up to 4K HDR (high dynamic range) quality – if your television supports it. Some of its services are free, while others require a subscription.

► Another smart way to cut the cord is to consider an over-the-air DVR, like the Tablo DUAL LITE ($149), which gives you access to live TV broadcasts – including news and sports – which aren't available on most streaming platforms, like Netflix. To use this product, you’ll need an over-the-air HDTV antenna, internet connection, recording storage (like a hard drive), and a WiFi-enabled device like Roku or Apple TV.

► Want free videogames while cocooning? Who doesn't. Here are ""the 26 best free video games to play while you're stuck at home.""

Borrow rather than buy

If you prefer thumbing through a great novel over staring at the TV, of course you can buy ebooks and audiobooks, but did you know you can also borrow them from your local library? Yes, for free.

You won’t need to drive to the library, nor are there late fees to worry about.

So long as you have your library card and the Libby by OverDrive app installed on your device, there are tens of thousands of supported libraries worldwide. On the day it expires, it won't be accessible on your device – unless you extend the loan period.

And no, it’s not just old classics available, but many of the newer New York Times bestsellers, too. Libby also boasts an impressive built-in e-book reader, graphic novel viewer, and audiobook player.

In fact, e-readers like the Kobo Nia ($99) have OverDrive built in, allowing you to wirelessly reserve and download ebooks on your device. Because of its glare-free 6-inch screen, Kobo Nia is better for reading outdoors than tablets.

Also, your Amazon Prime membership ($12.99 a month) gives you access to free Kindle ebooks, as well as Prime Video (movies and TV shows), Amazon Music, unlimited online photo storage and access to Twitch videos.

Free calls, texts

While this might fall into the ""duh"" department, remember you can keep in touch with friends and family, anywhere in the world – and with video, too – without having to pay for it. And you have a huge choice in services, like Zoom, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Google Meet and FaceTime.

Services like Facebook Messenger and Houseparty also support interactive games, so you can have fun while having a virtual happy hour with friends.

And speaking of saving money, did you know you can make free phone calls and texts, and even get a free incoming number? The TextNow app, for iOS and Android, lets you make unlimited calls to any 10-digit number in the U.S. and Canada, over Wi-Fi.

The ad-supported app first asks what city you'd like your number to be from and will find an available local area code for you to use. You also get free voicemail, customizable ringtones, call forwarding and other features.

It's the catchphrase he used to kick off contestants when he hosted the reality show ""The Apprentice"" for years — a show that brought him pop-culture fame that helped boost his 2016 bid for president.

NBC cut ties with Trump in 2015 after he made ""derogatory statements"" about Mexican immigrants as he began his bid for president.

Media coverage of high turnover in his administration often invoked the phase, although, as the Associated Press noted in the year after Trump was elected, Trump often delegated the task of firing someone or publicly shamed those he wanted out, so they would simply quit.

As president in 2017, Trump invoked the catchphrase in a tweet saying football players who did not stand for the national Anthem should be told ""YOU'RE FIRED.""

While the catchphrase has faded in popularity in recent years, Trump's critics have not forgotten it:

In the coming years, you may be able to reach your destination by taking an ultra-high-speed pod that zips through a vacuum in a metal tube.

Virgin Hyperloop took a step closer to making its high-speed transit technology a reality on Sunday with the first official test of the system with humans inside the pod.

The company, part of billionaire business titan Richard Branson's Virgin Group, said the test took place on its 500-meter track outside of Las Vegas.

Co-founder and chief technology officer Josh Giegel and Sara Luchian, director of passenger experience, rode in a two-person hyperloop pod for about 15 seconds, reaching a top speed of 107 miles per hour.

The eventual goal is to reach speeds of about 1,000 kilometers per hour, or about 621 mph, in yet-to-be-designed 28-person pods. At those speeds, it would be traveling at about the same rate as a commercial jet but with no greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change.

Closer to reality?:Tech billionaire Elon Musk plans hyperloop high-speed acceleration and braking test

The company had previously run 400 unoccupied tests of a system that first generated buzz when Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed it as a solution for high-speed long-distance travel several years ago.

""For me, it was just such a thrill—an exhilarating feeling,"" Luchian said. ""From a physical perspective, it was actually a lot smoother even than I was expecting.""

Giegel said, ""Even before we actually started moving it was all a bit surreal.""

The Virgin Hyperloop uses electromagnetic levitation propulsion inside a vacuum tube, simulating what it feels like to travel at an altitude of about 200,000 feet, or five to six times the altitude of commercial jets.

While Musk's initial vision called for hyperloop rails connecting cities over long distances, Virgin Hyperloop is aiming to begin with shorter routes and eventually expand to farther distances. Giegel said it would likely begin with routes of 10 to 20 miles and that it could travel underground or above ground.

""We’re direct to your destination,"" he said. ""We’re not stopping at every place along the way.""

For now, the company hasn't provided official cost estimates, which could vary considerably based on whether the technology is deployed in a public or private capacity. But Giegel said the company's goal is to provide rides for a price in the ballpark of 20 cents per mile, which would equate to $4 for a 20-mile ride.

""We’re not looking to be exclusively for the rich or anything like that,"" he said.

Among the company's biggest hurdles are regulatory approval and convincing passengers to try the technology, he said.

44,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/11/09/joe-biden-travel-policies-heres-what-changes-expect/6224937002/,What will a Biden presidency mean for travel? Here's what changes to expect,"A new president is headed to the White House in January, and travelers should expect to see changes under a Joe Biden administration, from who's allowed into the country to infrastructure improvements to help for laid-off and furloughed travel industry workers.

President-elect Joe Biden has committed to extending more relief to airline and hotel workers who have been furloughed or laid off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

He's pledged to reverse two policies of the Trump administration: a ban on travel to the United States from 13 mostly Muslim countries, and the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, which has a variety of implications for travel.

Biden is a big supporter of Amtrak and high-speed rail, and he's pledged a big investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. He also wants to shift transportation to cleaner fuels and electric power in an effort to reduce carbon pollution and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Here's what's likely coming when the new administration takes office:

Relief for workers

Airlines, Amtrak and hotels have laid off or furloughed thousands of workers as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While Congress and President Donald Trump helped backstop them earlier this year through the CARES Act, that support ran out at the end of September.

Roger Dow, the president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, congratulated Biden and praised his support for additional travel industry relief.

""The travel industry accounts for more than a third of overall U.S. unemployment, and policies to promote relief, recovery, and stimulus for travel businesses are integral to a U.S. economic turnaround,"" Dow said in a statement.

The airlines have asked for $25 billion to avoid layoffs, and Amtrak requested $1.5 billion. They haven't received it, though, mostly due to differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Though the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA endorsed Biden and congratulated him on his victory, the union's president said its members can't wait until Biden takes office for relief.

""The inauguration is months away. Our health and economic crisis did not stop for the election, and workers cannot wait until January to feed our families or pay our bills,"" said Sara Nelson. ""Our country continues to set records for single-day COVID cases. Flight Attendants and working people do not have the luxury of waiting for a Biden Administration or new Congress to get relief.""

Travel restrictions

President-elect Biden has promised to immediately end the Trump administration's temporary ban on travelers from 13 majority-Muslim countries. The administration cited national security concerns for enacting the restrictions, but critics called it the Muslim Ban.

Trump enacted the restriction on travelers from seven countries immediately after taking office in 2017. Those countries were Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela.

Trump expanded the restrictions to six other countries in January: Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania.

Civil liberties and Muslim-advocacy groups fought the restrictions in court. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld them in 2018 with a 5-4 vote.

""President-elect Biden has pledged to end the Muslim Ban on his first day in office, include Muslims at every level of his administration and address issues of racial and religious discrimination,"" said Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, in a statement.

Infrastructure week

Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he took office, but almost four years later, it hasn't happened. Infrastructure is popular with state and local officials on both sides of the aisle, and infrastructure bills are among the few that get strong bipartisan support in Congress.

An infrastructure bill would mean improvements to roads, bridges, transit systems and airports. Biden has promised to make a ""far-reaching"" investment of $1.3 trillion over 10 years. That includes $50 billion in the first year to repair highway infrastructure.

He also promises to bring zero-emissions public transportation options to every city with more than 100,000 residents. That includes light rail and buses and infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.

The Biden plan proposes to reduce emissions from transportation with electricity and clean fuels for trains, transit and school buses, ferries and passenger vehicles.

Amtrak Joe is back

A Biden administration would likely invest heavily in passenger rail. Biden famously commuted from his home in Delaware to Capitol Hill by Amtrak, and the 50-year-old passenger railroad could get a boost from his administration.

President Barack Obama's economic stimulus legislation supported passenger rail improvements nationwide, and a Biden administration promises to do the same.

And it may not be just Amtrak getting the funds. Biden could accelerate high-speed rail projects in densely populated states such as Florida, Texas and California, as well as the traditional Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington.

In a statement, President and CEO Bill Flynn said Amtrak looks forward to working with Biden and Congress ""to get the economy moving and help Amtrak and our employees through this unprecedented situation.""

Amtrak had to cut service and furlough employees as the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the record levels of ridership it had seen in recent years.

A Biden administration will be friendlier to Amtrak's efforts to replace aging bridges and tunnels on the Northeast Corridor that have become bottlenecks.

In particular, the tunnels under the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York Penn Station, heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, will get a higher priority for repair and replacement. Trump has been accused of slowing the effort because he didn't win New Jersey or New York and clashed with both states' governors.

The Biden plan would cut travel time from New York to Washington by half. It would support the completion of California's high-speed rail project and invest in faster passenger rail corridors in the South, Midwest and far West.

Going greener

Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, reversing Trump. The transition team has proposed putting the United States on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, and that has implications for all forms of surface travel and aviation.

Transportation represents the fastest-growing source of U.S. climate pollution. Biden plan envisions a $1.7 trillion investment over 10 years. It would buy clean energy and zero-emission vehicles for the federal government. It would develop ""rigorous"" fuel economy standards that would result in full electrification of light- and medium-duty vehicles and improvements for heavy-duty vehicles.

Biden plans to work with mayors and governors to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations nationwide by 2030. The new administration will also restore the full electric vehicle tax credit to encourage the purchase of such cars.

Aviation accounts for 12% of global carbon dioxide emissions from transportation. By bringing the United States back into the Paris Agreement, Biden would commit to its goal of reducing aviation emissions 50% by 2050 and fully decarbonizing in the second half of the century."

Starting today, Park MGM will close from noon Mondays through noon Thursdays. The NoMad hotel at Park MGM will remain open seven days a week.

""This year has proven to be especially challenging due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the major meetings, conventions and events that typically fill Las Vegas’ calendars during the fall and winter months,"" wrote Anton Nikodemus, president and chief operating officer of the company's Las Vegas properties, in a letter to employees. ""With occupancy remaining low during weekdays, we have decided to temporarily adjust hotel operations to account for the current state of business.""

MGM Resorts does not expect to keep the closure past December, Nikodemus wrote, but will ""continue evaluating business levels.""

Nevada's casinos reopened June 4 under new restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19, including reduced occupancy, more space between gamblers and severely curtailed limits for meeting and convention space.

Those factors contributed to devastated third quarter earnings for MGM Resorts – an operating loss of $495 million.

MGM's occupancy rate during the third quarter was 44%. Driving mid-week traffic has been a challenge, CEO Bill Hornbuckle said, as conventions have not yet returned.

In September, 3,5 million people visited Las Vegas – a 51% drop year over year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Air travel to McCarran International Airport was down 60% in September – a loss of 2.6 million visitors.

The pandemic has essentially transformed Las Vegas from a global destination to a regional gambling hub dependent on drive-in business.

In July, Las Vegas Sands property Palazzo stopped taking weekday room reservations due to lack of demand."

SEATTLE (AP) — The CEO of Alaska Airlines’ parent is stepping down next year and will be replaced by the company’s president.

Alaska Air Group said Monday that Brad Tilden will retire as CEO on March 31 after leading Alaska for the past eight years. He will be replaced as CEO by Ben Minicucci, a 16-year veteran of the airline who was promoted to president in 2016. Tilden will remain chairman.

Seattle-based Alaska is the nation’s fifth-biggest airline and is particularly strong on the West Coast. Tilden expanded it by acquiring California-based Virgin America for $4 billion in 2016. In recent years, Alaska has been challenged by Delta Air Lines’ expansion in Seattle.

Like other carriers, Alaska has been hit hard by a pandemic that has devastated air travel. Last month, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $431 million.

In a statement, Tilden, 59, said the company is “through the initial phases of our coronavirus response ... and now is the time to move forward with this long-planned transition.”

Airline stocks soared Monday on encouraging news about a potential vaccine for COVID-19. Shares of Alaska Air Group rose 15% in morning trading."

Opinion contributors

It is often said that being an entrepreneur is like rebuilding an airplane while it is in flight. Becoming president of the United States in January 2021 will be even harder.

When President-elect Joe Biden slips into the pilot’s seat, he will be assuming command of a plane in a storm, surrounded by other storms, one whose instrument panel shows at least five major warning lights flashing red. It will be a task even harder than the one Barack Obama and Biden inherited when they took over an economy in mid-recession. In fact, no president has faced such diverse, serious challenges since Franklin D. Roosevelt, who inherited a depression ravaged economy in a deeply divided society trying to navigate in an increasingly dangerous world.

As last week’s elections have shown, America remains profoundly divided along political, economic and social lines. Biden won more votes than any presidential candidate in our history, but President Donald Trump’s total was the second highest ever and the GOP has maintained control of the Senate and reduced the Democratic majority in the House.

Five crises for Biden's first 100 days

The massive challenges before the new administration will require not only creativity and leadership, they will also require winning agreement on a common agenda and ensuring at least a degree of support from both red and blue America. None of them can be solved by fiat or working on behalf of only a fraction of our states. Fortunately, this is precisely the approach Biden promised, one largely absent in recent years from our politics. The future of our country will depend on his ability to live up to this test.

When Biden takes office Jan. 20, we will be in the midst of the worst public health crisis since the flu pandemic of 1918. We will face a massive economic crisis with over 11 million unemployed. We will face the existential threat of the climate crisis. We will be viewed by the world for the first time since World War II as a deeply unreliable partner whose leadership can no longer be counted upon. And we will be confronting all these crises with a fractured political system that is barely functional.

These are the five major challenges facing America and Biden. In the first 100 days of his presidency, Biden and the new Congress will have to move forward with plans every bit as bold as Roosevelt's 100 days agenda during the Great Depression.

First, Biden must launch his science-based national plan to contain the COVID crisis. He must return science to the center of the solution, promote social distancing, mask use and tracing. And he must assist our cities and states, red and blue alike, as their resources are stretched to the limit. This also means assuring all Americans have access to affordable health care and that this crucial guarantee be protected from court action to dilute it.

Next, emergency relief must again be provided to those who have lost their jobs or been displaced by this virus. This must be a worker-oriented plan designed to preserve and create jobs, especially in hard-hit sectors — from restaurants to travel and tourism, from retail to the arts, large businesses and small. It means extending assistance for those at risk of losing their homes and providing cash support for those in greatest need.

Don't underestimate the president-elect:Biden ran a great campaign. He'll restore integrity and competence in a post-Trump era.

We need financing approaches that create jobs, such as an infrastructure bank to rebuild the critical infrastructure we have let decay for nearly five decades now. For an expenditure of just over $1 trillion over 10 years and the expertise a dedicated financial institution can provide, we can create jobs and stimulate economic growth in a way that attracts real bipartisan support.

Further, Biden has also committed to fund development and reward innovation in green technologies — new energy sources, electric vehicles, and broadband. Moving that forward, along with other steps to address the climate crisis, should also be a first 100 days priority.

Also essential to that development will be investing in the education and training of Americans in the technologies and skill essential to a 21st century economy. This should include another campaign promise that can win bipartisan support: Making free junior college education across the country and making life-long learning an affordable reality.

Plans that benefit all 50 states

All of these steps must be taken while dealing with the reality of our broken politics. Presenting plans that bring benefits to all 50 states will be key. But the Democrats must also be willing to use all the executive-branch tools at their disposal, as well as developing federal-state-local partnerships, to find solutions where partisan divisions are too great. This includes reforms that address institutional racism in America and restoring vitality, standards and purpose to institutions both at home and abroad. This last point is key when it comes to foreign relations. The United States must show the world that we stand by our friends, stand up to our enemies and remain committed to the rule of law internationally.

A deeply divided nation:Trump's huge vote total breaks my heart. I recognize this America and I wish I did not.

These steps are each essential if the next administration is to meet the unprecedented demands of this moment in our history. The price tag for all of the above is about the same as the $3.6 trillion the nation has already spent on COVID relief. But importantly, much of it is investment rather than spending — taxpayer dollars that will bring returns for many years to come.

Either we step up now to meet these challenges and frame them as the work of all Americans of both parties, or we risk the further destruction of those things that have made America great, deterioration of competitive standing in the world, limits to our ability to lead, threats to our security and most importantly, further divisions in a society that is in desperate need of healing and rebirth.

51,,https://www.reviewed.com/money/features/how-lower-your-utility-bills-and-energy-costs,10 tricks that help cut your utility bills,"Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.

On average, American households spend about $3,039 a year on energy bills, according to Move.org. And if you’re working from home right now, you've likely seen those costs to spike.

With keeping the lights on, running the AC or heat all day, and taking more trips to the bathroom between Zoom calls, it all adds up.

Fortunately, there are plenty of small ways to keep your utility bills in check. And as a bonus, these tricks help you save on energy costs, too.

If you’re looking to trim your gas, water, and electric bills, here are 10 ways to start.

1. Install a smart thermostat

Swapping out your old thermostat for a smart version is the easiest way to make your home’s HVAC unit more efficient, says Clint Robertson, home improvement expert and American Standard® Heating & Air Conditioning partner.

This change can help you shave as much as 10% to 12% off your heating bills, and up to 15% on cooling. If you’re in the market for one, one of our favorite smart thermostats costs $130.

Even if you’re not shopping around, your current one is most likely a programmable thermostat and you should look at the settings if you haven’t already.

2. Seal and insulate your home

About 20% of the air moving through your home is lost to air leaks and poor insulation. That leakage can raise your heating and cooling bills and make your home less comfortable.

Weatherizing your home, which involves sealing and insulating, can help plug the leaks and save 10% on your energy bill every year, according to EnergyStar.

The government-affiliated agency says you should first identify leaks in the attic and basement, where the air most commonly escapes. Throughout the house, install weather stripping around doors and windows, and fit caulking around outlets and pipes to further lower utility costs.

3. Reduce humidity

While humidity can make any outdoor activity unpleasant, it also wreaks havoc inside the home.

“A humid house will make the air conditioning work harder and won’t be easy on the utility bill,” Roberston, who's also a co-host of HGTV show Boise Boys, says. Plus, humidity promotes rot and mold—which leads to poor air quality, unsightly stains, and bad odors.

Robertson recommends keeping your house at 30%–50% humidity with these few steps:

Take shorter showers with cooler water. (One of these bathroom gadgets helps you control the temperature.)

Cover pots and pans while cooking.

Use dehumidifiers, which cost less than cooling the house.

We’ve tried out a bunch of dehumidifiers, and our favorite, the LG Puricare, reduced the amount of humidity by nearly 50% in about an hour and a half during our lab tests. At under $300, it’s easy to move and store, plus it also uses the least amount of energy of all the similar models we looked at.

4. Replace air conditioning filters

Regularly changing your air filters every 30 to 90 days “helps your HVAC operate properly rather than work overtime,” Robertson says. He recommends the American Standard QuikBox Filter Rack.

The advice applies for portable AC units, too. Replace these filters at least every three months for max efficiency, money savings, and improved air quality.

5. Close the blinds

About three-quarters of the sunlight coming through your windows is transferred into heat, which can make your air conditioning work harder in the summer. But Robertson says one simple trick to save on utilities can help you beat the heat.

“Closing windows, drapes, and blinds during the day—and opening them again when the sun goes down—is an easy and affordable way to help keep the house cool at all times,” he says.

You can even take it a step further with smart blinds, which are motorized shades that automatically adjust and can open and close on a set schedule.

6. Get an HVAC tuneup

EnergyStar suggests hiring a contractor once a year to service your HVAC system. The tuneup can cost up to $450, but it's worth the price tag because it helps the HVAC system run efficiently and keep utility bills in check. It can also lengthen the life of your HVAC, which costs about $5,500 to replace.

But, “if the system is more than 10 years old, consider what you'd save in a full replacement,” Robertson says. Repairing your air conditioning system, for example, could cost up to $1,500. Meanwhile, a new, energy-efficient HVAC system can help lower your energy bills and provide better air flow.

7. Swap out your light bulbs

Credit: Getty Images / undefined undefined In light of energy costs, swapping bulbs is a bright idea.

Switching to energy-efficient light bulbs is one of the easiest ways to cut your energy bills. Although halogen incandescent, CFL, and LED light bulbs cost a bit more upfront, they help you save money in the long run because they use less energy compared to traditional incandescent bulbs.

Shop for these light bulbs with the EnergyStar label, and you can save $45 each year. We’ve ranked our favorite smart light bulbs, with this Philips Hue starter kit coming in at number one because of its uncomplicated setup and easy-to-use app.

8. Check for state programs

Plenty of state and local programs offer money-saving incentives and ways to make your home more energy-efficient. To check out initiatives near you, head to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency and plug in your ZIP code. Depending on your location, you may find tax credits, grants that don’t need to be repaid, loan programs, and energy audits.

In Massachusetts, for example, the Mass Save program connects homeowners with energy experts who visit your home and identify ways you can save energy. They also give you free stuff like energy-efficient light bulbs, power strips, and showerheads.

9. Save water

Credit: Getty Images / Turnervisual Go with a low-flow fixture to cut down on your water bill.

Conserving your water usage can help cut down your water bill and preserve the natural resource. Here are some simple ways to save:

Turn off the tap when you scrub your hands, brush your teeth, and shave.

Limit your showers to five minutes or less.

Install water-saving showerheads or devices that restrict flow.

Repair leaky faucets and pipes.

In the yard, position your sprinklers so they’re only watering the plants and grass.

Consider getting a rain barrel.

10. Look for the EnergyStar label

EnergyStar is a labeling program developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To qualify for the label, appliances must meet or exceed minimum efficiency ratings.

Look for the designation on everything from kitchen appliances to water heaters and pool pumps. The label includes an annual cost-of-use estimation, which can help you budget realistically, keep your utility bills down, and reduce your energy use.

Washers and dryers, for example, are one of the biggest energy suckers in our homes. Our favorite set from Electrolux, with a designated spot for detergent pods to help evenly distribute soap, meets the EnergyStar standards.

— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.

With the holidays rapidly approaching, there are a number of reasons why you may be on the hunt for new cookware. Maybe you’re hosting a low-key, socially-distant Thanksgiving dinner and are in major need of a tried-and-true roasting pan or you’re trying to find the perfect gift for the chef in your life—either way, you’ve come to the right place. Some of our all-time favorite All-Clad cookware (yes, that All-Clad) is seriously discounted right now for the store's massive VIP Factory Seconds Sale.

Need help finding products? Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It’s free and you can unsubscribe at any time.

You can shop this huge savings event, which encompasses discounts of more than half-off everything from frying pans and stainless-steel cookware to kitchen tools and toaster ovens, runs through Wednesday, November 11. However, you’ll want to keep in mind that this is a “factory seconds sale,” meaning that these products may come with a small dent or scratch or arrive in damaged packing. Even so, these tiny flaws won’t affect the actual performance of the items.

Among the most exciting markdowns of the sale is the All-Clad 12-inch BD5 covered frying pan, which is super similar model to the pan we dubbed as our all-time favorite stainless-steel skillet, the All-Clad 4112 stainless steel 12-inch fry pan ($99.99). In testing, we described the 4112 as “the king of cookware” thanks to its heavy duty, tri-ply construction, which helped deliver perfectly seared steaks without a single sign of scorching. While the 12-inch BD5 is slightly different—namely, it has five bonded, dishwasher-safe dual-aluminum layers that are designed to provide even heat distribution and long-term durability as opposed to the 4112’s three layers—it’s still a solid choice, especially for its sale price. It also comes with an accompanying cover for the pan. While it typically retails for as much as $260, you can grab it for $129.95, giving you a little more than $130 in savings.

Also on sale is a slightly smaller version of one of our favorite roasting pans, the All-Clad E752C264 stainless steel large roaster (on sale for $129.99). This more compact 11-inch by 14-inch small roaster with rack, once $200, is $69.95 during this sale, falling by a total of 65%. In testing, there was a lot to love about the larger version, ranging from the tri-ply, stainless-steel construction, to the convenient, flat handles that are useful for maneuvering the pan in and out of the oven. This smaller model features the same characteristics that we adored in testing but can only hold turkeys that weigh up to 15 pounds as opposed to the large one's 25-pound capacity. However, it’s still oven- and broiler-safe up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit, warp-resistant and dishwasher-friendly. If you’re still in the market for an even bigger pan, similar models are also on sale, like this 13-inch by 16-inch nonstick large roaster (once $300 and now $99.95).

Ahead, check out some more insanely impressive discounts available at the VIP Factory Seconds Sale!

53,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/trump-isnt-gore-how-2020-s-legal-challenges-arent-same-2000/6220157002/,Why Donald Trump isn't Al Gore: How 2020 legal challenges to the election differ from 2000,"WASHINGTON – Around 2:30 a.m. on Nov. 8, 2000, Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore called his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, to concede, and he began making his way to the War Memorial Plaza in Nashville, Tennessee, to address his supporters.

Gore retracted his concession only an hour later. And networks retracted their projections that Bush had won Florida's 25 electoral votes. By the time the sun rose, the presidency remained undecided. Bush was ahead by only 1,784 votes out of about 6 million cast in the state, a very narrow margin that triggered an automatic recount.

What followed was five tumultuous weeks of back-to-back legal fights that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Gore pushed for manual recounts in certain counties; Bush pushed back against them. By December, the high court ruled 5-4 in Bush's favor to stop the manual recounts. The final tally had Bush ahead by just 537 votes.

What happened two decades ago is far from what's happening now in 2020, legal experts say.

In 2000, the outcome hinged on just one state: Florida. A win in the Sunshine State would push either candidate toward victory. In the end, a difference of only a few hundred votes was key to deciding the presidency, and this very narrow margin allowed both sides to fight aggressively over every ballot.

In 2020, President-elect Joe Biden is ahead by thousands of votes in five battleground states where President Donald Trump's team is pursuing legal action to challenge the results. The closest state, Georgia, which will hold a recount, has Biden ahead by 10,620 votes as of Monday at 3:03 p.m.

A recount is unlikely to change the outcome given the current margins. Claims of widespread voter fraud have not been backed by evidence. And election law experts say voter fraud is rare and, when it happens, it typically affects a miniscule number of votes.

""Basically, the election is over. There isn't anything that has come out that could plausibly affect the outcome,"" said David Boies, who led Gore's legal team in 2000. ""There's no legal avenue for the Trump campaign to plausibly dispute the results in any one state.""

Boies acknowledged that the Trump campaign is entitled to recounts. But, he said, ""recounts are going to affect hundreds of votes, maybe. They're not going to affect thousands of votes.""

'Very, very narrow' path to the U.S. Supreme Court

Trump, who has shown no sign of conceding, has repeatedly expressed his desire to lean on the U.S. Supreme Court, to which he has appointed three conservative justices, to tip the election in his favor.

But the path to the high court is ""very, very narrow,"" Boies said.

For the Supreme Court to be involved, there must be a federal or constitutional issue. Questions that have been raised so far, including allegations of voter fraud and not giving Republican poll watchers meaningful access to closely watch the counting of ballots, are all local or state issues over which the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction, Boies said.

""It is unlikely that any issue, any plausible issue, that could go before the court would really affect the outcome,"" Boies said. ""And I think that particularly in the absence of a determinative issue, the Supreme Court would be particularly reluctant (to be involved).""

A Supreme Court involvement?:Will the Supreme Court ride to Donald Trump's rescue? Don't count on it.

Barry Richard, who represented Bush in 2000, agreed, saying the highly politically charged environment is unlikely to persuade the high court to intervene.

""I think the Supreme Court does not want to become involved in selecting the president this year. In multiple polls, the American public has shown that of the three branches of government, it's the Supreme Court that the public has the highest regard for. I don't think they want to lose that, particularly the chief justice, John Roberts,"" Richard said. ""I don't think the court will take this unless they have to.""

For litigation over the 2020 election to reach the high court, there would have to be a repeat of 2000: an extremely tight race hinging on one swing state. Or, as Richard described, on two states, with each going a different direction.

There would also have to be legitimate constitutional questions.

In 2000, the Supreme Court looked at the issue of equal protection, which requires the government to treat individuals in the same way. There needed to be a uniform way of considering ballots during the recount, and there wasn't, which violated an equal-protection right voters have to have their ballots treated equally during an election. The court ruled that because Florida counties conduct recounts differently, continuing the recounts was unconstitutional.

In 2020, if local election officials had allowed poll watchers for one party to closely watch the counting of votes but did not do the same for poll watchers of the other party, ""there might be an issue,"" Richard said.

But that's not the case. There has been no evidence poll watchers from both parties were treated differently. There's also no evidence that ballots were counted improperly in favor of one candidate, experts say.

""I just think it's two entirely different situations. And I think the federal courts have learned (from the experience of 2000) that the federal court should not intervene in the elections,"" Boies said. ""The presidency should be determined by the voters in the ballot box, and not in court.""

On Monday, the Trump campaign invoked the Equal Protection Clause in a lawsuit alleging that mail-in voters were not subjected to the same level of transparency and verification requirements as in-person voters.

Conspiracy theory vs. factual evidence

In 2000, the Bush and Gore campaigns sent powerhouse lawyers to Florida, where they started collecting facts in multiple counties. Each legal team found what it believed to be discrepancies in the counting of votes in a race in which just a few hundred ballots could tip the results.

The controversy came down to very specific, technological issues. ""Hanging chads"" and ""dimpled chads"" became household terms.

Florida counties two decades ago used punch-type mechanical voting machines. Voters punched out ""chads"" – tiny portions of a paper ballot – using a small stylus to vote for their preferred candidate. If chads were punched out completely, the machines counted those votes.

But in cases in which chads were hanging by one corner (a hanging chad) or were indented but still attached (a dimpled chad), counties had different rules on whether to count the votes. And each side fought ""tooth and nail"" over every ballot, said David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.

Giuliani claims victory:Hawking conspiracies and cigars, ink-stained Giuliani falsely declares Trump won presidency

""This was a highly complex, incredibly well-litigated dispute in one state over a few hundred ballots,"" Becker said.

This year is entirely different.

""The claims that have been made at these parking lot press conferences have not held any water in court or under scrutiny, and they've been rejected every time by the courts,"" Becker said, referring to a news conference by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia. ""This is litigation by conspiracy theory. ... It's very different from Florida (in 2000), where both sides were litigating based on reams of factual evidence.""

Trump said that beginning Monday, his campaign would ""start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated."" Giuliani did not respond to a text message seeking details of plans on any additional lawsuits.

Where the 2020 lawsuits stand

Pennsylvania: The Trump campaign, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and others have filed a flurry of lawsuits and legal briefs about the controversial three-day extension for voters to return mail ballots, the rights of people to observe ballot counting, and the process for “curing” ballots when mistakes are made.

On Monday, Trump's campaign filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania alleging that mail-in voters and in-person voters were treated differently and thus violating the Equal Protection Clause and Elections and Electors Clauses.

One of the most consequential cases involve challenges to a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that upheld a three-day extension of the deadline for accepting mail and absentee votes.

Opponents of the extension have argued it was unconstitutional because it sidestepped the Pennsylvania lawmakers who enacted the deadline in 2019. The secretary of state’s office has argued the extension was a reasonable accommodation for voters given the coronavirus pandemic and mail delays.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the extension but said ballots received after Election Day should be segregated and tallied separately.

The Republican Party of Pennsylvania has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to order county election boards to segregate and take no action on mail and absentee ballots that were received after Election Day.

However, the Pennsylvania secretary of state said in a Supreme Court filing that all election boards had kept late ballots separate and tallied them apart from other ballots.

That means late-arriving ballots were not included in the vote totals that media organizations relied on to project Biden as the winner of Pennsylvania on Saturday.

A case over ballot-counting monitoring is headed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Trump campaign argued that one of its observers was kept too far away from ballot counting in Philadelphia.

A trial-level court ruled there had been no violation of the state’s election code, but an appeals court overturned that and directed that observers be allowed within 6 feet, subject to COVID-19 protections. On Monday, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court agreed to consider an appeal of that ruling.

Arizona: The Trump campaign has sued in Maricopa County, alleging Arizona voters were given Sharpie pens to mark selections, and when vote tabulation machines flagged some ballots as defective, poll workers improperly overrode the machines.

State elections officials have denied that ballots were tabulated improperly. They say Sharpies work best because they don’t smear or bleed through, which would cause voting machines to detect erroneous selections in a race. In a letter to Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs’ office decried “Sharpiegate” as an “unfounded conspiracy theory.”

A hearing on the lawsuit was scheduled Monday afternoon.

Georgia: The Trump campaign and Georgia Republicans went to court the day after the election, alleging the Chatham County Board of Elections had improperly intermingled ineligible ballots with valid ones.

A judge dismissed the case the next day for lack of evidence after the county elections head said he reviewed all 53 ballots in question and concluded they had been received before the deadline on Election Day.

Michigan: A Michigan judge threw out a Trump campaign lawsuit last week seeking an order that the secretary of state provide “meaningful access” for observers to watch ballot counting and allow it to view videotaped surveillance of ballot drop boxes.

The judge said the secretary had already issued a directive providing access to observers, the counting was complete, and there was no legal basis to provide videos. The judge dismissed as hearsay an affidavit from a Republican poll watcher in Detroit alleging she heard about a date on a ballot being improperly altered.

The Trump campaign is appealing the case.

Nevada: Republicans have brought cases in state and federal court alleging problems with software used to match signatures on mail ballots, but judges declined to stop vote counting.

A lawsuit arguing campaign observers had inadequate access to monitor ballot counting was settled after the parties agreed they would have more access.

The Nevada Republican Party has asked the Department of Justice to investigate its allegation that about 3,000 nonresidents cast ballots in the state. Clark County Registrar of Voters Joseph Gloria said he would look into the allegation, but he said it’s common for out-of-state voters to cast ballots, including those serving in the military, university students and elected officials serving in Washington, D.C.

Jennifer Eckhart, a former Fox Business producer who filed a civil suit in July naming Henry and Fox News, on Monday amended the lawsuit to push back against Fox News' denial of wrongdoing.

Fox News responded to the original lawsuit by denying that anyone had raised sexual harassment concerns about Henry prior to Eckhart in June 2020. “There were no sexual harassment claims against Ed Henry at Fox News prior to Jennifer Eckhart’s claim on June 25, 2020,” the network's statement to USA TODAY said in July.

Eckhart's amended lawsuit alleges that this denial is not true. ""The new allegations make clear that Fox News’ blanket denials are untruthful, and we look forward to taking discovery in this case to learn even more,” said one of her lawyers, Michael Willemin, in a statement to USA TODAY.

Eckhart cited the alleged experiences of multiple women, some of them named, who claim they were sexually harassed by Henry or engaged in sex with him out of fear of losing their jobs at the cable news channel, and their careers.

Fox News issued a statement to USA TODAY late Monday that reiterated its earlier response to Eckhart's lawsuit: that there were no claims against Henry at Fox prior to June 2020.

“Upon first learning of the allegations, we promptly commenced an independent investigation and took immediate action, firing Mr. Henry within six days of the notification on July 1, 2020,"" the statement said.

""FOX News takes all claims of harassment, misconduct and retaliation extremely seriously and maintains a zero tolerance policy that is strictly enforced throughout the company which is why Mr. Henry was fired within days of Ms. Eckhart’s complaint.”

In October, Henry filed a motion seeking to dismiss Eckhart's lawsuit, arguing that her claims he raped her are ""malicious and defamatory."" His lawyers say she sent Henry ""erotic and encouraging text messages,"" along with salacious and explicit pictures of herself, suggesting she pursued ""a consensual relationship"" with him.

Eckhart rejected that argument last month. ""No man is entitled to violently rape a woman because she sent him consensual-looking text messages,"" she told USA TODAY in a statement.

In the amended Eckhart lawsuit, one of the women named, media relations professional Brooke Hammerling, says she met Henry when he worked at CNN and described his aggressive sexual ""moves,"" which she declined.

""I felt like swatting him away like a fly,"" Hammerling is quoted as saying in the lawsuit. ""He was not someone that would directly impact my job so I didn’t really care.""

But she said publicly, in a tweet in August after Henry was fired on July 1 and after the original lawsuit was filed three weeks later, that Fox News had to know all about what she claims was widely known by ""women in the communications industry.""

“No chance @foxnews didn’t know about Ed Henry,"" her tweet read. ""He was a menace to many of us on the [communication's] side when he was at @cnn and everyone talked about it. Literally so so so gross.”

Another named woman, Roxie Marroquin, who says she met Henry in 2015 when she was 25, invited Henry to meet because she was seeking a mentor in the TV industry. At the time, Henry was the chief White House correspondent for Fox.

They agreed to meet in a Las Vegas hotel, she agreed to go to his room and then agreed to disrobe and get into a bathtub with him where he groped her and she ""submitted to the pressure"" of his ""advances.""

“I was honestly kind of afraid and frozen,"" she is quoted as saying in the complaint. ""I felt trapped, in a way, like, ‘oh man, did I give this person the wrong impression? What happens if I don’t do this?’...So, I ended up getting in the bathtub. Fully nude. How this happens to a 25-year-old, I can’t explain, besides fear of rejecting him.”

Later, she says, Henry began to fear she would report him and began sending her threatening messages. She claims Henry sent a private investigator to warn her to “keep her mouth closed,” and who told her he knew where she lived and that Henry would sue her if she talked.

But the lawsuit doesn't say whether she told anyone in Fox News management about these alleged encounters nor does it explain how the network managers would have learned of them otherwise.

The lawsuit claims that Fox was long aware of misconduct under its roof starting in mid-2016 when the network brought in an outside law firm to investigate sexual harassment arising from allegations against the late Roger Ailes, then the network chief, and former star anchor Bill O'Reilly.

""During the investigations, multiple women came forward to complain that Mr. Henry had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct towards them,"" the complaint says. ""These women came forward to complain before Ms. Eckhart was raped by Mr. Henry"" allegedly in a New York hotel in 2017.

Another woman Eckhart names in the complaint is Liz Claman, a Fox Business anchor for whom Eckhart once worked as an assistant. According to Eckhart, in 2016, after Henry was suspended by Fox for four months because of an affair with a Las Vegas stripper, Claman told her: ""Everyone at Fox News knows that Henry is a sex addict. That’s no secret.”

In her amended complaint, Eckhart accuses Claman of forcing Eckhart to perform humiliating tasks, such as cleaning out her refrigerator, and addressing her in a demeaning and belittling manner. Eckhart also was offended that Claman would undress in front of her in her office and walk around in ""nothing but underwear.""

USA TODAY reached out to Claman for comment through Fox News.

Eckhart's amended lawsuit features allegations against Henry from ""Jane Does"" who later shared their stories with Eckhart. ""Jane Doe 1,"" currently an associate producer for Fox News in Washington, is quoted in the amended lawsuit accusing Henry of sending her a picture of his penis soon after they met.

""Despite being warned about Mr. Henry’s lascivious behavior, Ms. Doe 1 entered into a relationship with Mr. Henry, seduced by his senior position and high profile, all enabled by Fox News,"" the complaint says. ""Ms. Doe 1 has described her relationship with Mr. Henry as emotionally abusive. She further stated that she was 'taken advantage of because I was much younger than him. There was a power imbalance.'""

After Eckhart filed her lawsuit, Jane Doe 1 tweeted her support. The complaint accuses a Fox News human resources executive of calling her and attempting to intimidate her for publicly supporting Eckhart.

Eckhart says in her complaint that in February, after she complained about a toxic environment at Fox, she was put on a “Performance Improvement Plan” and eventually fired, even though she had up to then received numerous positive performance reviews.

“The amended complaint lays out how Fox News attempted to bury its head in the sand and refused to take appropriate action to protect its female employees, including Ms. Eckhart, all in the name of its bottom line,"" Eckhart's lawyer, Willemin, said in his statement.

In July, after Eckhart and Cathy Areu, who appeared as a guest on Fox, filed a joint lawsuit (they have since been separated), Fox issued a lengthy statement in response, assertingbased on findings by an independent investigation, that all of Areu's allegations against Fox were ""false, patently frivolous and utterly devoid of any merit.

""We take all claims of harassment, misconduct and retaliation seriously, promptly investigating them and taking immediate action as needed — in this case, the appropriate action based on our investigation is to defend vigorously against these baseless allegations,"" the statement said. ""Ms. Areu and Jennifer Eckhart can pursue their claims against Ed Henry directly with him, as FOX News already took swift action as soon as it learned of Ms. Eckhart’s claims on June 25 and Mr. Henry is no longer employed by the network.”"

Amarjit and Balwinder Mann were arrested on charges of labor human trafficking, witness intimidation and wage theft involving a total of four victims, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office announced Monday.

The Manns, both 66, own what the district attorney's office called a ""profitable liquor store and market"" in Gilroy, about 80 miles southeast of San Francisco. In February, an Alcoholic Beverage Control inspection led to investigators speaking with a man who ""appeared to be living in a small storage room in the back area of the store,"" the DA's office said in a news release.

Fact check:Trump signed 2 executive orders, 3 proclamations against human trafficking

The man worked 15 hours a day, seven days a week, and bathed in a mop bucket, the district attorney's office said. Agents found a mattress lying over milk crates, an office desk that contained clothes, and pots and pans for cooking on top of the desk, the agency said.

“Slavery officially was abolished in 1865,” District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. “Tragically, we are seeing examples of it in 2020. My office will prosecute anyone to the fullest extent of the law who practices this kind of criminal and inhumane exploitation.”

The investigation also found the man had flown from India and expected ""travel to the U.S. with the couple."" The two took the man's passport and money and then ""put him to work without pay or a key to leave the liquor store at night,"" according to the district attorney's office.

Investigators also found three other men — one of them had never heard of a minimum wage — who worked long hours and were barely paid. Two of the three men worked at the liquor store and the other worked at the market, the district attorney's office said.

The couple who owned the liquor store ""engaged in predatory recruitment of their workers from India and lured them with promises of travel and financial independence,"" the DA's office said."

Biden and Trudeau discuss COVID

President-elect Joe Biden spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday afternoon, where the two discussed racial justice working to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a readout from the Biden transition team, the two discussed an array of issues, including combating climate change and collaborating on strengthening NATO. Biden “indicated that he looks forward to working closely” with Trudeau on these issues.

This is the first read out the Biden transition has released of the president-elect speaking with a global leader. On Saturday, Trudeau was quick to congratulate Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris after being projected as the winners of the election.

“I just spoke with @JoeBiden, and congratulated him again on his election. We’ve worked with each other before, and we’re ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and COVID-19,” Trudeau wrote in a tweet.

“On these and other issues, President-elect @JoeBiden and I agreed to keep in touch and work closely together,” Trudeau added in a separate tweet.

Trump campaign adviser David Bossie tests positive for COVID-19

David Bossie, who was tapped just a few days ago to handle the Trump campaign’s legal efforts to challenge the results of the election, is the latest in the president’s orbit to test positive for the coronavirus.

Bossie’s diagnosis was reported on Monday just a few hours after news broke that Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, also had tested positive for COVID-19.

Bossie, 55, was recently in Phoenix, Arizona to participate in a press conference about election results, and has traveled to the campaign headquarters in Virginia several times in the last week. He was often seen not wearing a mask.

According to NBC News, Bossie tested positive on Sunday.

McConnell: 'Trump is 100% within his rights' to challenge election results

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered his strongest support yet in President Donald Trump's quest to challenge the results of the presidential race, arguing the president is within his rights to take his fight to the courts and refrain from conceding.

""President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor Monday. ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light. And if the Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny.”

While McConnell backed Trump's legal efforts, he did not echo the president's baseless claims about voter fraud and Democrats breaking the law to steal the election from him. McConnell also did not back Trump's claim that he was the winner of the presidential race, but he did voice support for the president's refusal to concede.

""Let’s have no lectures about how the President should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election,"" he said.

McConnell's speech marked the latest comments displaying the divide among Republicans over the results of the election. Some senators like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have congratulated Biden on his win, but others, like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas have said the election had not been decided yet and backed Trump's efforts.

Georgia senators call on Secretary of State to resign

Georgia’s Republican senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue called on their state’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to resign over his handling of the state’s close election.

Calling the management of Georgia’s elections “an embarrassment,” Loeffler and Perdue said ""the Secretary of State has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections.

“He has failed the people of Georgia, and he should step down immediately,” said the senators.

Both Loeffler and Perdue are set to face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, respectively, in a January runoff election.

Perdue and Loeffler did not elaborate in their statement on what was dishonest or nontransparent about the election.

Raffensberger and the Secretary of State’s office have rejected claims of widespread fraud in the state’s elections.

Georgia’s voter implementation manager Gabriel Sterling told reporters Monday Georgia’s shift towards Democrats was not “overly surprising” to those who track the state’s politics.

There might be some irregularities found as the state tabulated results, he said, but it was “unlikely” it would make the difference in the presidential election.

Raffensperger said in a statement, although the senators had called for him to be fired, ""that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me.""

Raffensperger called the senators' accusations of a lack of transparency in the election ""laughable"" and said while there might have been some illegal voting, it would not affect the outcome of the presidential election.

Pence declares that election 'AIN’T over'

Vice President Mike Pence tweeted Monday that he is firmly behind efforts to keep counting “legal” votes as the Trump campaign tries to find a way to undo Joe Biden’s victory, which has been declared by media networks and recognized by a growing number of prominent Republicans.

“Told @VP Team Today: ‘it ain’t over til it’s over .. and this AIN’T over.!’ President @realDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” the vice president wrote in a tweet.

President Donald Trump’s legal team has argued, without merit, that several states – notably Pennsylvania – has counted ballots it shouldn’t have and prematurely awarded Biden the victory he needed to win the White House.

Sen. Susan Collins becomes third Republican senator to congratulate Biden on victory

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, became the third Republican senator to congratulate former Vice President Joe Biden on winning the presidential election, saying in a statement that Biden ""loves this country, and I wish him every success.""

Collins, who was reelected to her fifth term in the Senate last week, said President Donald Trump “should be afforded the opportunity” to contest election results. Trump has refused to concede the election, and his campaign has announced plans to litigate election results.

The Maine Republican urged patience, saying “the process has not failed our country in more than 200 years, and it is not going to fail our country this year.”

Republican lawmakers have split over accepting Biden’s victory. Some senators like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also congratulated Biden, but others, like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas have said the election has not been decided yet.

Joe Biden warns of a ‘very dark winter,’ implores Americans to wear masks

President-elect Joe Biden on Monday warned about a “very dark winter” to come as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread and implored Americans to wear face masks before a vaccine is available.

“There’s a need for bold action to fight this pandemic,” Biden said after holding his first meeting with a new COVID-19 advisory task force he assembled. “We’re still facing a very dark winter.”

Coronavirus cases are at an all-time high, topping 10 million overall cases after several days of more than 100,000 daily cases. More than 238,000 Americans have died from the virus, and Biden said projections show another 200,000 more could die in the coming months.

Biden, who has expressed support for a nationwide mask mandate enforced by state and local officials, said that although he won’t be sworn in as president until Jan. 20, his message is for everyone: “Just wear a mask for the next few months.”

“We could save tens of thousands of lives if people just wear their masks,” Biden said, calling it the “single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID” as the nation awaits a vaccine.

“Please, I implore you. Wear a mask. Do it for yourself. Do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together.""

Biden, who cleared 270 electoral votes Saturday to defeat President Donald Trump in the race for president, said his task force is working to implement his plan to fight the virus ahead of his inauguration. The group’s first meeting came after Pfizer and its collaborator BioNTech released early study results Monday indicating that their vaccine, BNT162b2, prevented more than 90% of infections with the virus that causes COVID-19.

“Even if it is approved,” Biden said, the vaccine won’t be available for “many months to come.”

He said his advisory board will “build on a bedrock of science” to make rapid testing more widely available, expand contract tracing, prepare for the deployment of a vaccine, develop the guidance for the reopening of schools and businesses and “ramp up” the deployment of personal protective equipment.

""This election is over. It's time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that's designed to demonize one another,” Biden said. “It's time to end the politicization of basic responsible public health steps like mask-wearing and social distancing. We have to come tougher to heal the soul of this country so we can effectively address this crisis as one country.”

Defiant Trump tees off but doesn't concede

President Donald Trump spent the weekend that saw his Democratic rival Joe Biden declared the election winner on the golf course, playing at his club in Northern Virginia both Saturday and Sunday, and refusing to concede the race.

""The simple fact is this election is far from over,"" Trump said in a statement Saturday.

If Trump refuses to deliver a public concession speech or make a congratulatory call to Biden, it would break with 124 years of American history. Experts say it would also undermine the election results and exacerbate the nation's political tensions, already laid bare by a bitter campaign and the extended, contested vote count.

""It will be truly harmful,” said William Howell, chair of the political science department at the University of Chicago. ""Concession speeches are a kind of affirmation about the legitimacy of elections.""

Biden unveils his COVID-19 advisers

President-elect Joe Biden unveiled Monday members of his COVID-19 advisory board and it includes Rick Bright, a former Trump administration whistleblower who resigned amid allegations his early warnings over the pandemic were ignored.

The task force, a group of public health experts – almost all doctors – will offer guidance to Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and their coronavirus staff as they prepare to take over the presidency. The board's composition could be an indicator of the Biden administration's intent to follow a more science-based coronavirus approach.

The revelation of the task force members comes as Pfizer released study results indicating that their vaccine, BNT162b2, prevented more than 90% of infections with the virus that causes COVID-19.

Kremlin holds off Biden congrats, cites 'absolutely obvious' difference from 2016

Russian President Vladimir Putin – whose government worked to ""denigrate Former Vice President Joe Biden"" during the campaign, according to U.S. intelligence – will hold off on congratulating the Democratic president-elect until the official result and ""legal procedures"" are completed, his spokesman told reporters Monday.

""We consider it correct to wait for the official results of the elections to be announced,"" Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian news agency Tass.

Putin sent Trump a congratulatory telegram after news media organizations projected him the winner in the early hours the day after the 2016 election, but Peskov told reporters there was an ""absolutely obvious"" difference from four years ago, citing ""legal procedures that were announced by the incumbent president.""

In August, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said Russia was ""using a range of measures"" during the campaign ""to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden"" and 'boost President Trump’s candidacy.""

Clyburn: 'Defund the police' cost Dems seats, hurt Black Lives Matter movement

House Majority Whip James Clyburn criticized calls to ""defund the police"" during several media appearances on Sunday, saying that the phrase hurt Democratic congressional candidates and could potentially derail the Black Lives Matter movement.

Clyburn said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he'd spoken with the late Rep. John Lewis about the phrase this summer, the two concluding ""that it had the possibilities of doing to the Black Lives Matter movement and current movements across the country what 'Burn, baby, burn' did to us back in 1960.""

Clyburn also cited calls to ""defund the police"" as a reason why Democrats lost races for Congress in the election, saying ""these headlines can kill a political effort."" He pointed to the use of the slogan in political campaign ads against two fellow South Carolina Democrats: Rep. Joe Cunningham who was defeated after one term, and Jaime Harrison, who tried in vain to unseat GOP incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham.

118,2020-04-10 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/04/10/coronavirus-travel-airline-refund-dot-canceled-flight-changed-flight-american-airlines/2964706001/,I snagged an airline refund amid the pandemic; here's how to get one if you're eligible,"As many travelers are learning for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic, airlines owe you a refund – not just a travel voucher – if they cancel your flight or change it significantly.

The U.S. Department of Transportation warned airlines last week that the policy still applies despite the historic level of flight cancellations that have left airports eerily empty. The warning came after a spike in complaints about denied refunds.

For weeks, travel experts – myself included – have been telling passengers with nonrefundable tickets not to rush to cancel booked flights in hopes the airline will cancel or change it first and refund their money.

I put the advice to the test this week, albeit it without putting much money on the line.

With a planned trip to see my family in Arizona for Easter scuttled, I had no need for my American Airlines return flight from Phoenix to Chicago on April 14. (I used Southwest Airlines frequent flier points for the flight to Phoenix and was able to postpone that trip with no penalty.)

I could have canceled the American leg weeks ago and banked the airfare for a future trip without paying those onerous change fees because my flight was covered by one of the airline's many coronavirus travel waivers.

But I waited because I preferred a refund for the $50 one-way basic economy ticket and wanted a firsthand look at the refund process.

The opening for a refund arrived in my inbox late Monday.

The subject line: ""There's been a change in your trip.''

Travel bailouts: Airlines, hotels and travel agents all got them. Shouldn't the public?

American has not canceled my flight from Phoenix (yet) but the departure was nearly three hours earlier than scheduled.

Airline policies vary on what is considered a significant schedule change, but American has long allowed a refund if the change is as little as 61 minutes. The airline recently changed the time frame to four hours given the mass schedule changes resulting from the pandemic, but that only applies to new ticket purchases, and pretty much no one is buying airline tickets right now.

First, I tried to cancel my flight on American's website but, like its competitors, the airline does not make it known to those who click cancel that they might be eligible for a refund. They want you to rebook to a later date or take a credit, especially when no cash is coming in from new bookings during a pandemic.

Even if you do find American's online refund form, a popup window says: ""Don't worry the value of your ticket is safe. When you're ready to rebook you'll be able to use the value of your unused ticket and seat purchase to a future trip. There is no need to request a refund or or call reservations right now.''

To make sure I wasn't automatically issued a voucher if I canceled online, I decided to call American's general reservations line. (I have no status in the airline's frequent flyer program that provides access to dedicated customer service lines.)

The hours-long wait times common a few weeks ago have come down and I was quoted a 27-minute to 37-minute time frame for a callback.

I received a call back in 30 minutes and talked with a friendly agent named Liz. i told her my flight was changed and that I should be eligible for a refund.

Liz looked at the change and agreed, though she didn't formally approve or process the refund. She canceled the flight and directed me to prefunds.aa.com to fill out a request for a refund. She told me I could have actually canceled it online and then submitted the request, as all refund requests go through the same online channel.

All I needed to submit the request on American's website, she said, was my ticket number and my name.

""Do you have your ticket number?'' she asked.

She looked it up and I jotted it down.

""It takes about seven to 14 days to process that refund,'' she said.

The phone call took less than five minutes.

The form was a cinch to fill out and I received confirmation it was received and under review. My $50 ($48.40 to be exact) should show up before the end of the month on my credit card statement, in time to cover the inflated price of hand weights I'm about to buy.

Airline cancel your flight due to coronavirus crisis? You're still due a refund, DOT says

How to get your own refund if you're eligible

1. Don't voluntarily cancel the flight on your own. Wait for the airline to cancel it or make significant changes that might make you eligible to get your money back instead of a travel credit or voucher.

2. Keep an eye on your email for notices of flight changes or cancellations. Note that airline policies vary on what constitutes a significant schedule change so what worked for me might not apply to your itinerary. If your flight has not been canceled by the airline or changed significantly, you are not eligible for a refund unless you had a refundable ticket.

3. Don't see an email? Check your reservation on the airline's website to see if there are any changes. If the flight is in the immediate future, check the flight status feature on the airline's website.

4. Be persistent and cite the DOT's guidelines on refunds for canceled or significantly changed flights. If you're told the policy doesn't apply during a pandemic, mention the DOT's enforcement notice issued April 3.

5. Don't berate airline reservation agents. Be firm, not rude.

Even as Hawaii finally enacts a long-awaited testing program that will allow out-of-state visitors to return without spending their entire vacation in quarantine, New Mexico is taking that option off the table.

USA TODAY has an update on the states that are discouraging interstate travel by requiring or recommending that visitors and residents returning from other states quarantine. And some states are requiring a recent, negative COVID-19 test in lieu of a blanket quarantine policy.

Some counties or municipalities have issued similar advice to travelers, so anyone looking to go on a road trip or take a vacation should check government websites for their destination and anywhere they plan to stop overnight.

Here are the states that require or recommend traveler quarantines:

Alaska

Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced that beginning August 11, non-Alaska residents need a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival in the state or proof they are waiting on results from a test taken in that 72-hour period. Non-residents without a pre-test can get one on arrival, though for a price.

""If a non-resident arrives without a pre-test, testing is available for $250 per test,"" according to a policy on the state's website. ""The traveler will be required to quarantine while waiting on results.""

Testing is free for Alaska residents.

The previous policy, below, will stay in effect through August 10.

Dunleavy and the state's Department of Health and Social Services lifted the state's mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers. Both interstate and international travelers can come to Alaska as long as they meet the following requirements:

If tested within 72 hours to five days before they leave their destination, they can come into Alaska with proof of a negative PCR coronavirus test. They can't enter if the test is positive.

Alternately, if they had a negative PCR test within five days of departure, they can retest upon arrival in Alaska. They should minimize contact until the results of the second test come in.

If the traveler is a member of the critical infrastructure workforce, as determined by the state, they have to adhere to their company's community protective plan the state has on file.

If none of the above applies (the traveler doesn't have a test result, rejects testing, or is not a critical worker), that person must quarantine for 14 days.

Arkansas

While the state no longer mandates a 14-day quarantine for visitors, it still asks that Arkansans consider doing so when returning from travel to affected areas.

Connecticut

Effective June 25, the state will require a 14-day quarantine for any visitor or resident returning from a region with a transmission rate of 10 positive tests for every 100,000 residents on a seven-day rolling average.

District of Columbia

Washington, D.C. will require travelers coming to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days if they are arriving from a high-risk area on nonessential travel.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said July 24 that the self-quarantine requirement would take effect the following week. Maryland and Virginia, which border D.C., are exempt from the order, but other states that see a seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases at 10 or more per 100,000 people will be affected.

As of Sept. 21, the updated list of ""high-risk states"" that require a 14-day self-quarantine include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin .

Florida

Effective Aug. 6, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rescinded the state's14-day quarantine rule for visitors from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Hawaii

Hawaii's long-awaited COVID-19 testing program is in effect as of Oct. 15. The program allows out-of-state travelers to bypass a mandatory 14-day quarantine by presenting a negative nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) test from an approved lab,taken within 72 hours before they arrive. All visitors ages 5 and up must be tested in order to skip quarantine. Travelers must also complete the state's mandatory Travel and Health Form. The negative test result must be uploaded to the visitor's Safe Travels account before they can leave quarantine. According to the state, the mandatory 14-day quarantine remains in effect for all inter-island travelers, except for those arriving on the island of Oahu.

Hawaii vacations are finally a lot easier: But are tourists really welcome?

Check here for weekly updates on Tuesdays.

Kansas

The state requires a 14-day quarantine for those heading to Kansas who have traveled domestically and been at gatherings of more than 500 people, beginning on or after Aug. 11.

Kentucky

Under a new advisory announced Monday, Kentuckians who travel to nine hot spot states reporting positive testing rates equal or greater than 15% are now recommended to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine. The states included in Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s travel advisory are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas and Mississippi.

Beshear said case clusters have been traced to residents who have recently returned from vacations or attended large gatherings such as block parties or barbecues.

Maine

Unless a visitor has a negative PCR COVID-19 test result from within 72 hours of travel, all but those from the following states must self-quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their state of residency: Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts. Visitors under quarantine are not allowed to go to grocery stores and therefore must bring enough food to last the duration of their quarantine or arrange to have food brought to them.

Maryland

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on July 29 issued a travel advisory urging residents to avoid visiting some states with rapidly increasing cases of coronavirus.

The travel advisory applies to states with positive test rates of or higher than 10%. As of July 29, that would include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas.

Hogan said if people must visit those states, they should immediately be tested upon returning to Maryland and quarantine themselves until learning the results.

Massachusetts

As of Aug. 1, everyone coming into Massachusetts (except those coming from lower-risk states) must quarantine for 14 days or show a negative COVID-19 test result administered up to 72 hours in advance of their arrival. If the test results haven't come in before travelers get to Massachusetts, they quarantine until the results are in.

Anyone entering the state has to fill out a travel form before entering, also as of Aug. 1. However, those traveling from lower-risk states or who meet other exemptions won't have to do so. Details here.

People who don't follow the rules could be subject to a $500 fine per day.

Nebraska

Nebraskans returning from international travel and visitors coming to the state for less than 14 days should self-quarantine for the duration of their visit. The recommendation excludes health care workers, commuters and certain other groups.The recommendation excludes health care workers, commuters and certain other groups.

New Hampshire

Under the state's ""Safer at Home"" guidelines, it requests – but does not require – out-of-state visitors who will be staying in New Hampshire for an extended period of time to self-quarantine for 14 days.

New Jersey

Travelers flying into New Jersey from so-called hot spot states where coronavirus is spiking will be asked to fill out a survey starting July 20.

The announcement came from state health Commissioner Judith Persichilli more than three weeks after Gov. Phil Murphy joined his counterparts in New York and Connecticut to announce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors arriving from states with high numbers of positive cases.

Keep up with the list here.

New Mexico

Effective, Friday, Oct. 16, the state has rescinded a policy that allowed visitors to bypass a 14-day quarantine by presenting a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of travel. In addition, hotel occupancy has been capped at 60% for establishments certified safe by the state and 25% for those that have not.

New York

Gov. Andrew Cuomo's state, which was the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic early on, is also requiring visitors and residents returning from from out of state to quarantine for 14 days. Check the list.

Ahead of Memorial Day, the traditional start of the summer travel season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends staying home as much as possible.

The CDC advises people to not travel if they're sick, are in a higher-risk group for the coronavirus or live with someone who is. Higher-risk groups include people 65 and older and those with chronic health conditions.

But many Americans are considering road trips as a minimal-contact vacation option as opposed to the close quarters of traveling by plane. Those who do make summer travel driving plans may encounter checkpoints at state lines, quarantine orders, closed welcome centers and rest areas, and fewer open hotels and restaurants.

Summer travel outlook:Is coronavirus canceling summer vacation for 2020? It depends who you ask

Social distancing guidelines remain in place, and travelers may be required to wear a face mask when they stop for gas, groceries or other supplies.

""I don’t think this is going to be like any other kind of summer,"" said Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure assessment science at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health. ""Everything is going to be very different.""

The good news? Travelers will benefit from the lowest gas prices in 17 years, according to AAA. The national average is $1.87, about a dollar lower than a year ago. AAA says to expect prices to rise above $2 over the summer as states reopen and demand increases.

Summer road trippers will need to do more planning and preparation than they might otherwise. Hotel reservations should be made in advance, directly with the hotel. Motorists should plan on eating take-out food or bringing their own. They should check ahead to see which welcome centers and rest stops may be closed.

AAA has an interactive map that shows state-by-state restrictions that may affect road trippers. However, information is changing quickly, spokesman Jim Stratton said, so travelers should check multiple sources to see what they should expect at their destination and along the way.

The National Governors Association also has a state-by-state interactive map that shows coronavirus-related state restrictions and conditions travelers should know.

What to consider:To travel or not to travel during the coronavirus pandemic?

Checkpoints and quarantines

Rhode Island and Florida require drivers entering the state to check in.

Roadside checkpoints on interstates are set up to check for potential coronavirus cases. Drivers are diverted from the interstate to a rest area or weigh station, where they fill out a form provided by state police. Commercial trucks are allowed to bypass the screening.

Since March, Florida has required drivers from Louisiana, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to quarantine for 14 days, or the duration of their stay in the state, whichever is shorter. The restriction does not apply to airline employees, military personnel, commercial drivers or health care workers.

Travelers to Rhode Island must quarantine on arrival unless traveling for business. All cars with out-of-state plates are required to stop.

Texas ended roadside checkpoints at the Louisiana border in late April.

While most states may not have border checkpoints, some still require a 14-day quarantine for visitors.

Border crossings

The U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land borders have been closed to nonessential travel since late March and will remain closed until June 22, the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday.

Welcome centers and rest areas

Some welcome centers and rest areas are closed, and travelers should check each state's transportation department website for the most up-to-date information.

Masks and social distancing

Several states require people to wear face coverings in public: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island. Many others recommend it.

Social distancing guidelines remain in effect across the country, discouraging large gatherings and encouraging people to stay six feet apart.

Cashless tolls

State and regional tolling authorities across the country have closed their cash toll collection. If you don't have a transponder such as E-ZPass, expect to be billed by mail. That includes the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the New York Thruway, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Ohio Turnpike toll collectors still take cash, but have been provided with nitrile gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. The Indiana Toll Road has advised drivers paying with cash to expect delays at toll plazas due to reduced staffing.

The Florida Turnpike has stopped taking cash tolls. Those who do not have a SunPass account will receive an invoice by mail. The Florida Department of Transportation is temporarily waiving the $2.50 invoice administrative fee.

The Maryland Transportation Authority has switched to all-electronic tolling at its bridges and tunnels. Delaware's toll roads and bridges have also gone cashless."

Now that states are slowly starting to reopen, some of those landmarks are about to open up to visitors, too.

Not all national parks will open at the same time; most are consulting with federal, state and local health authorities to determine the right time and way to reopen.

Parks in states that have a high infection rate or are still under stay-at-home orders may open later than ones in states that weren't as affected or have already begun reopening.

When a park reopens, not everything will be back to normal right away. Some sites are only partially reopening to start, and others will limit their capacity to comply with social distancing guidelines. Indoor venues may require visitors to wear face coverings. Hand sanitizer and increased frequency of cleaning will be common.

Here's a list of what's opening and when, as well of others that remain closed:

Opening soon

Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona

The Grand Canyon National Park will open its South Rim entrance Friday. The park, which has been closed since March 24, will open to incoming traffic from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., though officials recommend arriving no later than 9:30 a.m. Once you enter the park, you'll be allowed to stay for the day, but overnight accommodations are not available. If you visit, plan on being self-sufficient. That means you should bring enough food and water for your trip.

Restroom facilities will be available by the South Entrance Grand Canyon National Park sign, picnic area east of Yaki Road, Shoshone Point and Buggeln picnic area. If you plan to use them, bring hand sanitizer.

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum, Ohio

Cleveland's Rock Hall has been closed since March 14. Its president and CEO, Greg Harris, anticipates a reopening date of June 15. There will be some changes: The museum will operate at half-capacity, and visitors will be issued a timed digital ticket, have their temperature checked before entry, and must wear face coverings.

The museum's hours will be limited at first, and touch screens and interactive exhibits will remain off-limits. Still, Harris said the museum will offer a safe experience while maintaining its focus on the music.

""We need to keep the DNA of rock and roll,"" he said.

Outer Banks, North Carolina

North Carolina's Outer Banks will lift its ban on visitors Saturday. The Outer Banks is a string of barrier islands stretching 120 miles from the Virginia border south to Ocracoke Island. It includes the towns of Duck, Southern Shores, Kitty Hawk, Kill Devil Hills, Nags Head and Manteo; Hatteras Island and Roanoke Island.

A number of coronavirus restrictions will remain in place, including social distancing guidelines and limits on gatherings to 10 people or less. Restaurants will continue to offer takeout only, and supermarkets may limit the number of people in the store at one time. Personal care, grooming and entertainment businesses remain closed.

Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming

Yellowstone, which has been closed since March 24, overlaps three states: Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. On Monday, the park's Wyoming entrances will reopen to visitors. Until the Montana entrances open, only the southern half of the park will be accessible. That includes the Old Faithful Geyser. Restrooms, trails, boardwalks and gas stations will be open. However, campgrounds and restaurants will not and tours won't be available.

Yellowstone to reopen: South half only due to states' differing quarantine restrictions

Las Vegas Strip, Nevada

While no date has been set for the reopening of Las Vegas casinos, the Nevada Gaming Commission has already approved a set of guidelines for them when they do.

Casinos are to operate at half capacity, and social distancing will be enforced by casino employees and surveillance. Blackjack, craps, poker and roulette tables will be limited to a certain number of players, and no crowds will be allowed around gaming tables. Hand sanitizer will be available and items like dice, cards and wheels will be disinfected before the next person can touch them.

No more than 250 people will be able to gather in the city's meeting and convention spaces, and social distancing will be enforced. Nightclubs and dayclubs will remain closed.

Empire State Building Observatory and One World Observatory, New York

The Empire State Building's 86th-floor observatory has been closed to visitors since March 16. Alexandra Chernin, a spokesperson for Empire State Realty Trust, said the observatory has plans to reopen ""at reduced capacity with social distancing as soon as allowed by authorities.""

One World Observatory, perched on the 102nd floor of One World Trade Center, has been closed since March 14. Kristen Bothwell, a spokeswoman, said the observatory is evaluating its plans to reopen.

""We will have more certainty in the coming weeks on an official opening date,"" she said.

Hearst Castle, California

The California State Parks system suspended tours of Hearst Castle, the estate of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, on March 16. The estate, known as the Hearst San Simeon State Historic Monument, has not set a date to reopen to the general public. The park itself remains open to local residents, but with no vehicular access.

Gateway Arch, Missouri

St. Louis' Gateway Arch National Park closed to visitors on March 18, and that includes the tram ride to the top of the arch, the on-site museum, and riverboat cruises on two 19th-century replica paddlewheel boats. However, the grounds themselves remain open.

No date has been set to reopen the 630-foot-tall arch, which was designed by Eero Saarinen and was completed in 1965 as a symbol of America's westward expansion.

National Mall, District of Columbia

The National Mall and Memorial Parks, while not completely closed to the public, has a number of noteworthy closures related to the coronavirus. The Washington Monument and Ford's Theatre are closed. All restrooms on the mall are closed, and parking is restricted. Athletic fields and volleyball courts are closed, as are concession operations including sightseeing tours, food and beverage kiosks, retail and souvenir stores and Tidal Basin paddle boats.

Walt Disney World, Florida

Walt Disney World has been closed since mid-March, and it remains unclear when it will reopen. However, last month a local government coronavirus task force issued some guidelines on what the theme park might look like when it does open its gates.

Among the changes: The park would initially operate at half-capacity. Employees would wear face coverings and have their temperatures checked at the start of their shifts. Touchless hand sanitizer dispensers would be placed throughout the park, and surfaces and railings would be wiped down regularly. Queues for rides and attractions would require appropriate social distancing.

Restaurants at the park would operate at half-capacity, and tables would be spaced 6 feet apart. Menus would be disposable. Hotel mini-bars would not be stocked, and coffee makers, coffee cups and glassware would be removed from guest rooms. All entry doors to retail spaces would be propped or automated. Distancing markers would be placed at check-out counters.

Attorney Mohammad Malik, 35, and Dr. Noor Shan, a 29-year-old NYU Langone medical center surgical resident, had been married only four days before they were pulled under by a rip current near their resort, COMO Parrot Cay, on Oct. 28.

""It's a devastating loss,"" the groom's father, Col. R. Maqbool Malik, told Long Island's Newsday. ""This is a shock beyond belief. And it's a tragedy of different dimensions when you have to lay two children to rest in a joint funeral.""

He said witnesses were able to pull the couple from the water and perform CPR, but both died at the scene.

""COMO Parrot Cay and the COMO Group are deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred while hotel guests were in the ocean off Parrot Cay in late October,"" the resort said in a statement provided by spokesman Chris Orlikowski. ""We have worked with the authorities of the Turks & Caicos to fully cooperate with their investigation into this incident.""

Maqbool Malik took the resort to task for allegedly not posting adequate signs warning of the dangers of rip currents.

Orlikowski declined to comment on the complaint.

COMO Parrot Cay just reopened on Oct. 1 after a COVID-19 pandemic closure. USA TODAY has also reached out to the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas, which serves Turks and Caicos and notified the families, according to Newsday.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines rip currents as ""powerful, narrow channels of fast-moving water."" It also noted that rip currents are often confused with riptides, which happen ""near inlets and the mouths of estuaries, embayments, and harbors.""

NOAA advises that if you are caught in a rip current or riptide, the safest course of action is to float or swim parallel to shore, which will take you away from the current. Trying to swim against it will result only in tiring you out. Once you can see land, swim diagonally toward the shore.

Better yet, the agency said, ask lifeguards about any hazards before getting in the water and make a point of swimming close to a lifeguard station.

NOAA's website estimated that rip currents result in tens of thousands of rescues and 100 deaths a year."

Associated Press

BERLIN (AP) — Berlin bid farewell Sunday to the German capital’s central Tegel airport, beloved by some and reviled by others, as it shifts all air traffic to a new hub on the outskirts of the city.

On Saturday, airlines moved their last planes stationed at Tegel to the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport Willy Brandt, which finally opened at the end of October nine years late and far above its original budget.

The final scheduled flight took off Sunday afternoon from Tegel, an Air France jet to Paris, a tribute to the first commercial flight from the airport flown by the airline 60 years ago.

During the Cold War when Berlin was divided into French, American, British and Soviet sectors, each had its own airport.

The oldest, the American sector’s Tempelhof Airport, was closed in 2008 and its main area is now parkland. Britain’s Gatow airport was shuttered in 1994, and the Soviet Schoenefeld Airport, located in the surrounding state of Brandenburg in what was communist East Germany, was expanded into the new so-called BER.

Tegel, a site used for airships in the early 1900s and later an air force training area during the Nazi era, was constructed rapidly in 1948 as a response to the Soviet blockade of West Berlin, when the Western Allies had to supply the city entirely by air.

It became a critical hub for the Berlin Airlift operation, which was able to break the Soviet blockade by 1949 — a key moment in the Cold War that demonstrated the Western Allies’ resolve to stand beside West Germany.

More:Berlin airport opens 9 years late amid Germany's new partial coronavirus shutdown

The first commercial flights began in 1960, when Air France started regular service to Tegel.

Tegel’s facilities had become taxed, however, by the increased traffic to Berlin after German reunification when the city again became the capital. Area residents frequently complained of noise, and its runways were also unable to handle the largest jumbo jets typically used for long-haul flights, meaning that Berlin travelers would usually have to transfer in Frankfurt or other hubs before flying to North America or farther afield.

It was much beloved by business travelers and many others, however, for its convenient location near the center of the city, and compact layout that meant passengers could disembark a flight, pick up their luggage and be in a taxi within a few dozen meters.

The city government planned to close it in 2011, but the delays in the opening of BER meant that it had to be kept open.

A majority of Berliners voted in a non-binding referendum in 2017 to keep Tegel open, but the city said the result couldn’t be implemented for legal and financial reasons.

The city plans now to turn the facility into a research and industrial park for urban technology in the future.

As a precaution in case there are any more kinks to be worked out at the new airport, however, Tegel will remain operational as a backup for another half-year but no more flights are planned."

Associated Press

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The first flight carrying Israeli tourists to the United Arab Emirates landed Sunday in the city-state of Dubai, the latest sign of the normalization deal reached between the two nations.

FlyDubai flight No. FZ8194 landed at Dubai International Airport just after 5:40 p.m., bringing the tourists to the skyscraper-studded city after a nearly three-hour trip. The low-cost carrier had sent one of its Boeing 737s to Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv earlier Sunday morning to pick up the passengers.

The flight flew across Saudi Arabia and then over the waters of the Persian Gulf to reach the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms also home to Abu Dhabi.

The flight, put together by an Israeli company called Gaya Tours, saw Jewish Israelis and a number of Arab Israelis on board. Many of the Jewish Israelis wore kippah head coverings.

Many of the people on the flight said it was not their first time to the UAE, but all said they were excited to be in Dubai. The tourists were joined by a number of businessmen eager for opportunities in the Emirates.

“There is no doubt that the normalization between Israel and the UAE will bring good things and benefit to the Arabs inside Israel. There is no doubt about that,” said Hussein Suleiman, the head of an Arab businessmen’s delegation on board the flight. “We are supportive of this deal and of the normalization, and we are here today to normalize the normalization in reality.”

The arrival of tourists comes as Dubai in particular tries to revive its vital tourism industry amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The UAE and Israel have agreed to launch regular commercial flights between their countries soon, while other recent flights have carried business and governmental delegations.

FlyDubai plans to begin its flights to Tel Aviv later this month. The airline described Sunday’s flight as a “commercial charter flight” for the incoming tourists, without elaborating.

It comes as Israel and the UAE, which had maintained covert contacts for years, brought their diplomatic relationship out into the open. It signed a normalization deal with Israel alongside Bahrain at a White House ceremony in September, making the them the third and fourth Arab nations to currently have peace with Israel.

But while Egypt and Jordan earlier signed peace deals, the UAE has said it anticipates having a “warm” peace with Israel. The Emirates also hopes the deal with aid its efforts to purchase advanced F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. The deals also unite three nations that remain suspicious of Iran.

However, the agreements did not address the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, who view the pacts as a stab in the back from their fellow Arabs and a betrayal of their cause for a Palestinian state. The agreements, which were seen as a foreign policy win for President Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 3 election, now face the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden."

Instead, she attended the retreat via Zoom from her house. It didn't go well. She wound up getting distracted by laundry and her 11-year-old triplets' virtual schooling.

""It was just terrible,"" she said. ""It was worse than a normal day.""

When it came time for the fall retreat, Lounsbury tried something different: She booked ""a cute loft apartment above a store"" three miles from her house through AirBnB.

""It was night and day,"" said Lounsbury, who's worked from home for years and sometimes spends several hours a day on Zoom calls. ""I felt so focused on the retreat.""

Lounsbury is among a growing group of workers who have looked to hotel rooms, resort villas and other spaces as an alternative to working at home during the coronavirus pandemic and the chaos it can bring.

The hotel industry is eager to open its empty rooms to those seeking a quiet place to work. According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, hotel occupancy is projected to be 38% in 2020, which would make it the worst year on record. Occupancy was 66% in 2019. Eight in 10 hotel rooms are vacant, the group says, and 70% of hotel employees have been laid off or furloughed.

otels, resorts and vacation-rental services like Airbnb are hurting after more than six months of travel restrictions and decreased business travel. So they've begun promoting their properties as comfortable, quiet workspaces with reliable WiFi, access to phones and printers, and pools, gyms and bars for off-work hours. And they're emphasizing enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures toreassure COVID-weary guests.

""The protocols we have for cleanliness were already over the top,"" said Ed Kinney, global vice president of corporate affairs for Marriott Vacations Worldwide. ""We were doing a great amount over what was ever required.""

Among the offerings from major hotel chains:

Marriott: The chain is promoting three kinds of work stays. The first is a Day Pass, which allows use of a room during the workday, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. A Stay Pass gets you the room from 6 a.m. the first day to 6 p.m. the next day. The package includes a $10 food and beverage certificate redeemable on site and access to amenities like the hotel gym and pool. A Play Pass enables you to bring the family, with activities for kids and access to private workspaces and meeting rooms.

Hilton: Workspaces by Hilton is available at the company's U.S. and United Kingdom hotels. The package includes standard WiFi and access to a room or suite. It also guarantees you a separate workspace. When guests check in at the front desk, hey will provide their departure time, select food and beverage options and receive a digital key on their phone. Bookings can be canceled on the day of arrival up to check-in time without penalty.

Hyatt: The Work From Hyatt package is aimed at vacationers who want to bring their work – and their kids. It includes complimentary or discounted laundry service, complimentary self or valet parking, flexibility on housekeeping services, free WiFi and waived resort fees. A daily food and beverage credit is also included. Packages can be booked through March 31 for a minimum stay of seven days.

Work From Hyatt initially launched at about 25 hotels, said Asad Ahmed, senior vice president for Commercial Services for the Americas. Due to pent up demand, it's now being offered at nearly 90 properties and will likely expand further in 2021.

A working vacation

The vacation timeshare business is also promoting work vacations to its owners.

Marriott Vacations Worldwide, which manages more than 100 vacation properties worldwide, offers a home-like setting for its owners to work remotely but still get away.

""The properties are very different from a hotel,"" Kinney said. ""The accommodations are very spacious.""

Though the core of the company's properties are domestic, in locations such as Williamsburg, Virginia; Orlando, Florida; and Hilton Head, South Carolina, some resorts are in Mexico, Europe and Asia.

""Every property has its own personality,"" Kinney said.

Kinney said the typical property is a two-bedroom villa that's 1,150 to 1,250 square feet, much larger than a typical hotel room. Owners purchase one week a year at the properties, and that lasts in perpetuity. The cost is paid upfront, runs between $25,000 and $30,000 and can be passed down to the owner's heirs.

It appears to be a popular option. Although timeshare occupancy is lower than the pre-COVID days of 90%, they're still averaging 70% during the pandemic. And that rate is still higher than at most hotels, which bottomed out at 25% in July. Since then, occupancy rates have slowly climbed back and were about 44% for the week ending Oct. 31, according to hospitality data-tracking firm STR.

""They’re kind of envious of us,"" he said.

Close to home

For people looking for a home-like workspace but who don't own a vacation property, there are alternatives.

Lounsbury considered booking her work retreat at a Marriott hotel. But then she discovered that her four-night, three-day AirBnb stay would cost about $70 per night, no more than she'd pay at a hotel. And that was with cleaning fees on top. All told, the stay was less than $400, an expense that she will be able to deduct for business purposes.

""A little staycation in your own city is wonderful,"" she said. ""That is worth paying several hundred dollars to get the brainspace to do your best work.""

Lounsbury had more space than a hotel room, would not be interrupted by housekeepers and could cook and eat her own meals. She did yoga.

Though her family was close by, she didn't see them during her retreat.

""I didn’t want to break the spell,"" she said. ""I wanted to stay where I was.""

Booking the Airbnb freed her from worrying about what was happening at home.

""You’re relieved of all those coulds and shoulds,"" Lounsbury said. ""It relieves the mental burdens we have in our own house.""

In fact, Lounsbury said her husband got to live her life at home for a few days, balancing work with child care.

""He experienced my productivity challenge,"" she said. ""I kind of enjoyed letting him feel that for a bit.""

Still, she says she hesitated before dropping $400.

""It seemed unnecessary,"" she said. ""There’s no reason that I need to leave my house, logistically.""

But in the end, Lounsbury, who described her experience on Instagram, said she'd do it again.

""The hard thing is convincing yourself you deserve it,"" she said. ""The pandemic gives you an excuse to do it."""

Associated Press

State officials on Friday advised Vermonters not to travel during Thanksgiving and to limit social gatherings in general and to no more than 10 people with a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in Vermont and a surge in cases regionally and nationally.

“The data and the trends of the past few weeks are sending a clear message that we need to up our game in order to protect ourselves and our communities and prevent large-spread infections,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine during the governor's bi-weekly virus briefing.

Even small gatherings can have a big impact, he said. In Vermont, events such as birth parties, dinner parties, sleepovers, baby showers and barbecues have resulted in the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, he said.

“I am strongly urging people to lay low this season and forego nonessential travel,” Levine said. He also “strongly"" advises that any social gatherings be with 10 or fewer people and with a very limited number of trusted households.

“We cannot know for sure each others infection status. And that's how the virus spreads,” he said. ""Even though we call people trusted households and they mean no ill to us or us to them, it is very challenging in an environment where there is more virus around for people to understand what their potential infection status is at any given point in time even if they've had a test recently.""

In Vermont's largest city, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger on Friday urged Chittenden County residents to double down after the county's seven-day average rose to 12.9 new cases per day.

“We are facing an elevated risk of virus infections in the community right now and this weekend is the time when we can bring it back down, back under control,"" he said. ""I’m calling on everyone to exercise extra caution this weekend and until the number of new cases per day drops again.”

That means keeping gatherings very small, staying outdoors, wearing facial coverings and keeping 6-feet apart from people. He also urged people who have traveled to follow the state's quarantine rules and those who have attended Halloween parties or other large gatherings recently to consider quarantining and getting tested, while asking employers to return to remote working if possible.

Levine said the Health Department is following roughly 11 outbreaks and 42 ""situations,"" which he described as individual or small numbers of cases.

An outbreak stemming from sports teams at an ice arena in Montpelier has grown to 115 cases but is quieting down, he said. Those cases include 69 at St. Michael’s College in Colchester. There are new outbreaks at two work sites and in a Chittenden County community across several households from a social gathering, Levine said.

“For a long time we’ve been reporting a steady rate of just a few new cases each day. And as you’ve seen the numbers have increased to double digits on most days,” he said.

Vermont reported 24 new cases of the virus on Friday, for a statewide total to date of 2,326 cases since the pandemic began. Three people were hospitalized on Friday with two people in intensive care. The total number of deaths has remained at 58 since late July.

Associated Press

INDIANAPOLIS — As young as 5 years old, La Tanya Autry loved visiting local museums like the Detroit Institute of Art with her mom. She relished the shows, dances and plays she saw there. But as she walked through their halls, she felt a disconnect.

There were few artworks by Black Americans like her in the works on display.

“They didn’t show my experiences or the experiences of so many other communities,” said Autry. “That has to change.”

Today she is on the front lines of a movement calling on museums to better represent communities and artists of color.

“What museums call 'neutral' is all part of a status quo system,” said Autry, a curatorial fellow at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland who helped start an initiative called Museums Are Not Neutral. “And that system perpetuates oppression, racism, injustice and colonialism.”

Museums already were struggling with questions of inclusivity when the coronavirus pandemic forced a lot of them to shutter in March. Then in May, the police killing of George Floyd led to protests and calls for racial justice. Tech and film companies, banks, sports leagues and other institutions started making changes as part of a racial reckoning.

Survey:A third of U.S. museums not confident they can survive coronavirus pandemic

Museums set the standard for what art is, and this standard has generally been decided by white men and excludes other viewpoints, said Mike Murawski, a Portland-based leader of Museums Are Not Neutral.

Among 18 major U.S. museums, 85% of artists featured are white, while 87% are men, according to a 2019 study conducted at Williams College.

Museums Are Not Neutral is calling for structural change, including in museums’ hiring practices, the makeup of their boards and their partnerships. They say museums should also return looted African artifacts and other items stolen from marginalized communities and former colonized countries.

“We want transformation, ... not solidarity statements, not cosmetic changes, not a little lipstick that gets wiped off a week later,” said Murawski, who is white.

Other initiatives include #DismantleNOMA, which hopes to reform the New Orleans Museum of Art's work environment and leadership. It started after five former NOMA employees signed an open letter this year alleging that the museum enabled the use of racial slurs, underrepresentation of Black artists and wage disparities for Black workers.

Such calls to action are not new, going at least as far back as the 1960s, when civil rights activists took issue with racism in museums and other institutions.

Murawski took up the cause in 2014, when two Black women — Aleia Brown and Adrianne Russell — launched #MuseumsRespondToFerguson after Michael Brown, a Black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white Ferguson, Missouri, police officer.

Other social-action groups include Museum Workers Speak and MASS Action.

Some museums are making moves to acknowledge racism within their walls. The Art Institute of Chicago, the Getty Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and many others issued solidarity statements following Floyd’s death. Some offered staff inclusivity training and issued diverse programming goals.

The nonprofit American Alliance of Museums is continuing a 2019 initiative to improve diversity on museum boards, offer equity training and evaluate the governing structures of 50 museums.

It's increasingly difficult for museum directors to argue for a neutral approach, said AAM president Laura Lott.

“Neutrality and partisanship often get confused,"" Lott said. “We shouldn’t be partisan and back certain candidates or political platforms, but that’s totally different from being neutral or taking positions on social and human rights issues.”

Museum attendance continues to skew toward the white and wealthy, the same communities disproportionately reflected on their walls and on museum boards.

The AAM found that in 2008, 79% of museum-goers were white, and that percentage was growing. A 2010 study by the group predicted that, if the trend continued, people of color would make up only 9% of museums' core visitors by 2033.

Educator and writer Gretchen Jennings, who has worked in museums and museum education for more than 30 years, said administrators have largely evaded systemic overhauls.

“Museums have not changed much structurally,” Jennings said. “They’re not seeing themselves as part of the problem.”

Autry said many museums still embrace the narrative that they are apolitical or represent a neutral perspective. When proposing programming on racial justice, she said, she has often encountered challenges from white colleagues saying her plans were too political.

In trying to do better recently, museums have made missteps. For instance, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art’s director, Max Hollein, apologized to Black artist Glenn Ligon this summer after using his art without permission in a letter addressing the museum's response to protests of racial injustice. The apology followed an Instagram post by Ligon in which he wrote, “could y’all just stop... Or ask me first?""

Ariana Curtis, curator of Latinx studies at the National Museum of African American History & Culture, said her experience has been different from that of many curators who work in white spaces. Curtis started her career at the Anacostia Community Museum, which opened in 1967 as part of the Black museum movement.

“These museums that came out of the Black museum movement came out of the experience that museums excluded us, and the way for us to center our perspectives is to build our own spaces,"" she said.

CruiseCritic.com

Royal Caribbean will resume sailings with short cruises to its private island, Perfect Day at CocoCay, once it has fulfilled the new requirements issued last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – and it may need volunteers to participate in the required ""simulation voyages"" required by the CDC.

The comments were made Wednesday by Vicki Freed, Royal Caribbean's senior vice president of Sales, Trade Support and Service, during her weekly coffee chat with travel advisors.

""We will be bringing back short cruises calling at Perfect Day at CocoCay,"" Freed told Royal Caribbean's travel agent partners. ""We're going to be doing a series of sailings using our employees and other volunteers,"" she continued. "" We haven't decided how we're going to select people at this point. We will be looking possibly for volunteers. We do not have all of the details yet fleshed out.""

'Framework for conditional sailing': Here's what cruise lines will have to do before CDC allows them to return to US waters

Freed also acknowledged the complexity of the CDC's new recommendations, noting that it will take some time for the company to go through the requirements and formulate a return-to-service strategy.

""It is complicated to go through this entire CDC recommendation, but we are going to do it,"" said Freed.

Though the CDC has required cruise lines to conduct simulated voyages as part of being certified for restricted cruise operations, the organization told Cruise Critic on Wednesday that exact details about these sailings – from dates, durations and even how prospective volunteers can apply – were still being hammered out.""CDC has not yet determined requirements for simulated voyages and further information about restricted voyages will be outlined in future technical instructions and orders,"" a CDC spokesperson told Cruise Critic in an email.

131,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2020/11/06/disneyland-buena-vista-street-reopening-holiday-shoppers/6185273002/,"Disneyland's retail and restaurant area, Buena Vista Street, to reopen Nov. 19","Disneyland's gates may still be shut but another section of Downtown Disney, the theme parks' retail and restaurant area, will reopen just in time for holiday shopping.

""We’re excited to share that Buena Vista Street opens Nov. 19, extending the Downtown Disney District at the Disneyland Resort with more Disney shopping and dining experiences,"" the company said in a blog post Thursday.

Admission is free, though visitors will have to pay a $10 parking fee.

Walt Disney World also reopened its retail area well ahead of the theme park. Disney Springs opened in May, followed by the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom on July 11. Epcot Center and Disney's Hollywood Studios reopened the following week.

Among the stores set to reopen: Elias & Co., a throwback department store; Julius Katz & Sons, which sells collectibles and home decor items; Kingswell Camera Shop, which sells frames and other photo-themed gifts; and Trolley Treats, a candy shop.

So why can Disneyland reopen its stores but not the theme park? California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy allows for retail stores located in counties in the ""substantial risk"" tier, such as Orange County (where the park is located), to operate at 50% capacity with some modifications, such as having a plan for responding to potential COVID-19 exposure and notify local health authorities.

Under state guidelines unveiled last month, large theme parks with 15,000+ capacity would only be allowed to open once their home counties enter the the yellow, or lowest-risk, tier.

That level requires there be less than one case a day per 100,000 residents and a testing positivity rate of less than 2%.

Earlier this week, the mayors of eight California cities including Los Angeles and Anaheim, wrote a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking him to consider allowing large theme parks such as Disneyland to reopen sooner than new state guidelines allow.

it could take weeks or even months to reach a rate of coronavirus infections that would allow them to reopen at 25% capacity.

""As you may have recently seen, labor unions and employee groups representing many of the workers at these theme parks have joined in calls for a timely, safe reopening,"" the mayors wrote. ""This call is a result of their direct knowledge of the health and safety protocols, and their need to get back to work.""

Disney has laid off 28,000 theme park employees as the result of the coronavirus pandemic, including more than 11,000 at Disney World in Florida.

Special to USA TODAY

If you're planning to travel somewhere soon, here's a little advice: Don't listen to the advice.

It's dated and maybe dangerous. The rules for travel in 2021 have changed. Ignore the talking heads. You don't need travel tips for next year – you need a survival guide.

""Anything can happen when you're traveling,"" says Daniel Durazo, a spokesman for Allianz Travel.

But anything doesn't have to happen to you. If you take a few precautions and plan ahead, you can avoid most problems. You'll need the right insurance and a backup plan – and you have to book with the right companies.

So how do you travel in 2021?

Here's a travel survival guide for next year:

Be careful. That's the advice of Melissa DaSilva, president of Trafalgar. ""Do thorough research to make educated decisions,” she says. ""The world is not off-limits, and local economies need your support more than ever. But it’s crucial to be responsible and educate yourself on all guidelines, restrictions and health procedures required along the way."" In other words, 2021 won't be the year for a spur-of-the-moment trip. Not with the pandemic still with us.

Plan ahead. ""This is key,"" says Linda Bendt, owner of Pique Travel, a travel agency in Minneapolis. ""We're jamming two years' worth of travel into six to nine months – assuming things start picking up in the second quarter of next year."" She says during peak times flights will be full, hotels fully booked, and car rental companies sold out of vehicles. If you don't plan, you'll be stuck with another staycation.

Know how COVID-19 affected your destination. If you think coronavirus did a number on you, then you should check your destination. ""The thing most people are probably not thinking about is how badly the shutdowns have hurt the economies in places that depend on tourism,"" says Mike Hallman, CEO of the medical transport and travel security company Medjet. ""It's had an impact on crime in a lot of destinations."" If you're not sure about the place you're visiting, Hallmann recommends the latest travel advisories from the U.S. Department of State, which contain detailed information about potential dangers in other countries. Official tourism sites are also good resources since they usually list current travel restrictions for those destinations.

Read the fine print on your travel insurance. Most American travelers don't know that their medical insurance won't work overseas unless they make special arrangements, says Christine Buggy, vice president of marketing at Travelex Insurance. ""Most U.S. health insurance companies will not provide coverage outside of the country, which can leave a traveler with a hefty bill in the event of a medical emergency,"" she says. She recommends looking for coverage that treats COVID-19 like any other sickness and does not exclude the pandemic.

Expect more lockdowns. Do you have a plan in case you get stuck somewhere? Your travel survival guide for 2021 should include one. ""Travelers should consider trips that can be planned around staying with friends and family with the option to then lock down in hotels later,"" advises Christina Tunnah, general manager for the Americas at World Nomads. Her tip: Sign up for hotel and airline newsletters so you can find the best rate for lodging and transportation if there's another pandemic lockdown.

Know when to go – and when to stay. If there's a vaccine next year, it will not be an instant cure. Some parts of the world will recover faster than others. ""When planning to travel, it's best to visit areas with low COVID-19 activity,"" says Zulfah Albertyn-Blanchard, a health intelligence analyst at WorldAware, a security company. ""This will make it less likely you'll infect someone else – or become infected yourself – during your travels."" So how do you find out if a place is safe? Start with its State Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel advisories. And if there's a travel ban, that's a good sign that you should wait.

Have a backup plan. Before the pandemic, a lot of travelers took a vacation without a Plan B. Don't do that in 2021, advises Sherry Sutton, vice president of marketing and communications at Travel Insured International. ""Have a backup plan,"" she advises. That includes a checklist of what to do if you run into trouble, from emergency contacts to direct numbers for your travel insurance company. And if your destination shuts down, know what you'll do to salvage the vacation.

Surviving 2021 will require not just new skills, but the right frame of mind as well. Hit the road with a 2019 attitude and you might regret it, say travel experts.

""Traveling in the near future will require flexibility as we continue to navigate this pandemic,"" says Jessica O’Riley, a spokeswoman for Travel Iowa. ""Pack your patience.""

The best of travel in 2021

The best airlines and hotels: the ones with flexible policies. ""Make sure you have an easy out with anything you book,"" says Kirsten Peterson, owner and senior travel consultant at Chicago-based Peterson Travel Group. ""Situations and conditions are changing rapidly."" For example, carriers like Southwest Airlines have a well-deserved reputation for being transparent and free of onerous fees.

The best travel insurance: ""Cancel for any reason."" That's the assessment of Jeremy Murchland, president of Seven Corners, a travel insurance company. You can cancel your trip for any reason. ""You'll be reimbursed for up to 75% of nonrefundable trip costs if cancellation must occur,"" he says. Cancel for any reason is a little pricier – between 10% and 12% of the cost of your trip, about twice as expensive as regular insurance. But if you have to cancel because of another outbreak, it's worth it.

The best plan: One made by a professional. Experts say your travel survival guide for 2021 should include a professional travel adviser. An agent can help you navigate the uncertainty of travel next year. Whether you're traveling out of state or out of the country, a pro can make sure all of your paperwork is in order. ""You may need to have negative test results in hand to enter certain states or countries,"" says Andrew Williams, managing director of Travel At Will, a Houston travel agency. ""Other destinations may have mandatory self-quarantine periods upon arrival."""
133,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/11/05/faq-what-covid-19-testing-ny-require-out-state-travel/6180289002/,Traveling to New York? Here's what to know about required COVID-19 tests to avoid quarantine,"New York's new COVID-19 testing requirements for travelers coming from outside its bordering states will take effect this week as coronavirus infections surge across the country.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order Saturday that mandated several new COVID-19 testing and quarantining protocols for travelers who were in another state for more than 24 hours, The Journal News, a USA TODAY Network publication, reports.

It came as New York effectively abandoned its prior rules that required travelers from a list of other states with rising COVID-19 cases to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in New York.

The state described the new program as a ""test out"" initiative meaning travelers can get out of the mandatory 14-day quarantine if they pass the COVID tests sooner.

""All the experts suggest we shift to a testing policy. And that's what we're going to do, and this is how it will work,"" Cuomo said Saturday. ""There will be no quarantine list; there will be no metrics. There will be one rule that applies across the country.""

The new travel requirements take effect Wednesday.

How does the new protocol impact travelers?

For travelers who were in another state for more than 24 hours:

They must obtain a test within three days of departure from that state.

The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.

On day four of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain another COVID test. If both tests come back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.

For travelers who were in another state for less than 24 hours:

The traveler does not need a test prior to their departure from the other state, and does not need to quarantine upon arrival in New York State.

However, the traveler must fill out New York's traveler form upon entry into the state, and take a COVID diagnostic test four days after their arrival in New York.

How will New York enforce COVID-19 testing for out-of-state travel?

Much of the enforcement of the new travel rules will involve local health departments, which will validate out-of-state travelers' COVID tests, according to the regulations.

If a test comes back positive, local health officials will issue isolation orders and initiate contact tracing to identify and quarantine other people exposed to the virus.

The local health department must make contact with the state the traveler came from, to ensure contact tracing proceeds there as well.

Violations of isolation or quarantine order connected to the travel mandate could result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000, according to the executive order.

Outside of contiguous states, all travelers must also continue to fill out New York's traveler form upon arrival into the state. The form consists of a questionnaire focused on recent travel, COVID symptoms and plans for adhering to New York's travel rules.

Most proactive enforcement efforts so far have focused on travelers arriving at airports, with contact-tracing workers stopping people to explain they must fill out the form and follow state orders related to out-of-state travel.

People who refuse to fill out the form can face a $2,000 fine.

Under the new rules, travelers arriving at airports in New York could also be asked to show COVID-19 test results, Cuomo said Monday, noting all of the testing data will be tracked by local and state health officials as part of compliance oversight.

Cuomo did not address plans for enforcing the new testing rules among motorists and train travelers.

He has repeatedly noted previously that it is difficult to enforce travel-related restrictions for motorists and train travel, but the regulations include a hot line for people to call, 1-833-789-0470, to report violators.

Who is exempt from NY's COVID-19 test rule for travelers?

For New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, the testing requirements do not apply because of how often people might travel between the states for work or personal trips, Cuomo said.

Further, exceptions to the travel advisory are permitted for essential workers and are limited based on the duration of time in designated states, as well as the intended duration of time in New York, according to the regulations.

Essential workers include people working in health care, public utilities, the food industry and other businesses listed on the Empire State Development's Essential Business list, as well as people who are already getting tested, such as some medical professionals.

The National Park Service tweeted on Thursday that areas affected by the East Troublesome Fire would reopen Friday, while the west side of the park remains closed due to fire impacts and safety assessments.

The park has been closed since Oct. 22.

All evacuations around the park's gateway town of Estes Park were lifted Monday as firefighters made significant progress containing the Cameron Peak Fire over the weekend.

The Cameron Peak Fire has burned nearly 209,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in Colorado state history.

The East Troublesome Fire, which started Oct. 14, initially burned west of Rocky Mountain National Park’s boundary. It grew more than 100,000 acres on Oct 21 alone and expanded into the western side of the park, then spotted over the Continental Divide to the east side of the park.

Nearly 29,000 acres have burned in the 265,600-acre national park, including to the western edge of Estes Park as well as in the northern part of the park.

But containment on the Cameron Peak Fire, which caused the evacuations of thousands of people and burned 442 structures — about half of them homes — has jumped to 85%, the fire incident command team announced Monday.

The Thompson Zone of the East Troublesome Fire, which is burning in the park despite more than a foot of snow last week, is showing containment for the first time since it sparked from the main fire on Oct. 22. That 4,889-acre spot fire is now 31% contained but prompted the evacuation of Estes Park.

The East Troublesome Fire, which now is the state's second-largest fire in state history at 193,774 acres with 37% containment, caused the evacuation of the west gateway town of Grand Lake. Evacuations of that town also have been lifted, but not without the loss of many homes.

Park officials said once the park does open, only some areas will be accessible based upon safety and fire behavior.

Park managers continue to assess fire activity and additional safety hazards, such as falling trees and downed power lines. Park staff is assessing infrastructure in outlying areas.

The park had a record 4.7 million visitors in 2019, making it the third-most visited national park.

The nearly 29,000 acres burned within the park is the most since the park was established 105 years ago. Park officials reported earlier that despite the damage to the landscape, they expected only minor damage to campgrounds and trails.

About 1.5 million acres of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests adjacent to the park also remain closed. That area was closed Oct. 20 due to the fires. About 300,000 acres of the Roosevelt National Forest west of Fort Collins was closed shortly after the Cameron Peak Fire started Aug. 13.

135,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/11/05/key-west-florida-voters-opt-ban-large-cruise-ships-visiting/6171877002/,"Key West votes to ban large cruise ships from docking, limit cruise visitors to 1,500 per day","Big cruise ships will no longer welcome at the southernmost point in the continental U.S.

On Tuesday, voters in Key West passed three ballot initiatives aimed at limiting the impact of visiting cruise ships on everyday island life.

According to the Monroe County Board of Elections, roughly 63% of residents voted to ban ships with the capacity to carry more than 1,300 passengers from docking in Key West.

Another 61% voted to limit the total number of passengers that can disembark from ships to 1,500 per day.

And 81% supported a measure that would give priority for those 1,500 slots to the cruise lines with the best environmental and health records. According to the Key West Committee for Safer, Cleaner Ships, which petitioned to get the initiatives on the ballot, each line's environmental record will be determined by the number of environmental violations, penalties and fines it receives. When considering their health records, Key West will look at each cruise line's inspection scores and violations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vessel Sanitation Program

Key West City Clerk Cheri Smith told USA TODAY the measures took effect immediately.

Arlo Haskell, the committee's treasurer, is relishing the group's victory.

""The people of Key West are thrilled to finally have some common-sense restrictions in place after 30 years of unregulated cruising that has damaged our environment, hampered economic growth, and threatened public health,"" he said.

Norwegian, Carnival and Disney Cruise Line all made port calls to Key West prior to the CDC's ban on cruising in U.S. waters last March. Most – if not all – of the ships that regularly visited, including Norwegian Sky, Carnival Conquest and Disney Magic, would no longer be able to because of the new capacity limit.

Michael Hopper, owner of the Southernmost House Hotel and the Seaside Café, was not one of the voters in favor of the initiatives aiming to limit cruise activity in the area.

""It will severely damage the economy at a time when the economy is extremely fragile,"" Hopper told USA TODAY. ""Most importantly, it will change the very nature of the community. Without the cruise ship bans, we were able to entertain visitors and tourists of all economic ranges.""

Key West has attracted a diverse group of tourists over the years, but the ban on larger ships will change that, he argued.

Although smaller ships will be allowed in, Hopper said their passengers are generally wealthier people who can afford the pricier fares. He sees that as a negative that will permanently damage his town.

""This community advertises itself as one human family,"" he said. ""We do and we should welcome tourists of all race, all color and all income. When you ban the more economically-available cruise ships from coming in in an effort to create an 'upscale community,' you’re doing everything to defeat our goal of one human family.""

Haskell pushed back against Hopper's argument, saying, ""It should go without saying, but a citywide mandate for common-sense restrictions on cruise ships has nothing to do with race. It is about protecting public health, the environment and our quality of life. It is about ensuring that our tourist economy serves future generations.""

And while 81% of voters supported the measure to prioritize environmentally friendly ships, Hopper said the initiatives combined will still block some of the more environmentally friendly lines from coming to visit.

""(It) bans Disney from coming into Key West by their cruise ships even though Disney has an enviable sterling environmental record,"" he said. ""It bans (Richard) Branson’s Virgin Voyages, which are state-of-the-art, environmentally sound cruise ships from coming into Key West (due to their size).""

In its 2020 report card, Friends of the Earth gave Disney a B-, the highest grade of any line. Virgin Voyages received a D. The group based its grades on criteria such as air pollution reduction, water quality compliance and sewage treatment.

“Large cruise ships degrade Key West in at least three ways,"" Shirley Freeman, former Mayor of Monroe County, said in a testimonial supporting the measures. She said they result in large crowds and attract ""the same shops in every port, taking away from the uniqueness of Key West. They also muddy the waters.""

""Before big cruise ships, the water here was crystal clear,"" she said. ""Now since COVID-19 has stopped all cruise ships temporarily, the water is much clearer.”

Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the industry's largest trade group, hopes to retain Key West as a travel partner.

""The cruise industry places incredible importance on being a strong partner in the communities where we visit, and we believe open dialogue and communication is a critical part of that,"" Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for CLIA, told USA TODAY. ""We hope to have that opportunity in Key West.""

Haskell is open to continuing that dialogue, telling USA TODAY: ""We look forward to working with them to make Key West the premier small ship destination in the Caribbean.

""As Key West turns its focus to small ships that can happily coexist with the overnight visitors that power our tourist economy, it will foster a more supportive business environment for our diverse, locally-owned hotels, restaurants and retail businesses, and it will only enhance our appeal as a destination to travelers from all over the world,"" he said.

However, Key West isn't likely to see any cruise-ship visitors until at least 2021, due to an industry-wide decision not to sail in U.S. waters the rest of this year."

All of those questions and more will be answered alongside even more adorable pictures of these majestic cows. Advertisement

They're easily identified by their shaggy coats and long horns – and for being unfathomably cute to look at.

Photo courtesy of E+ / georgeclerk Predominant coat colors might be due to the Queen's preference Highland cattle can appear in a rainbow of different colors, including dun, red, black and white. It's been said that red has become the color seen most often due to a reported remark from Queen Victoria on a visit to the Scottish Highlands. She allegedly expressed her preference for the red-colored cattle, and selective breeding began in an effort to please her.

Photo courtesy of E+ / JonnyJim Why are they so fluffy? These cows have such a distinctive coat to assist with cold tolerance. How they achieve such a legendary status of floof (definitely not a scientific term) is through a double coat of hair. The outer layer consists of oily hair, while the undercoat is soft and fluffy. 10Best These cute animal ambassadors will make you smile 10BEST These cute animal ambassadors will make you smile

Highland cattle are actually famous for having amazing temperaments. You should still be careful around them; they are much bigger than you, after all. But there's no need to fear them should they approach you in a welcoming manner.

Belted Galloways were later established as a separate breed in 1921. Unlike Highland cattle, belties are a rare breed. They can be found in countries around the globe including the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil, but the populations are small.

As with any large animal, one should always be mindful of their approach. Just enjoy seeing their amazingly adorable faces from afar – unless you've invited to see them closer."

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel will soon offer coronavirus testing at its main international airport, something authorities hope will speed the revival of air travel.

Passengers at Ben Gurion International Airport will be able to pay around $13 for a test and get results within 14 hours, with faster testing methods on offer in the coming weeks. Authorities say labs at the airport will be able to process 20,000 tests per day. Passengers can register starting Thursday and the testing booths open Sunday.

Visiting the facility on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it can “help us get back to a better, quicker and more efficient aviation routine,” adding that “we want to renew Israel’s link to the world.”

Israel is gradually emerging from its second nationwide lockdown since the pandemic began. The country has reported nearly 320,000 cases, including 2,674 deaths.

An earlier lockdown last spring largely succeeded in containing the outbreak, but cases surged over the summer after authorities reopened too quickly. At one point, Israel, with a population of just 9 million, had one of the world’s worst outbreaks on a per capita basis.

Authorities plan to gradually ease restrictions over several weeks following the second lockdown, which began in mid-September and was partially lifted last month.

Here's what is (and isn't) on the pandemic menu at US airlines","Flying during the pandemic has been a bring-your-own food and (soft) drinks affair when traveling in economy.

Airlines ditched or significantly scaled back in-flight food and drink service shortly after the coronavirus crisis began to reduce contact between flight attendants and travelers and the risk of spreading the contagious virus.

The lack of snacks, meals and drinks wasn't a big deal in the beginning because so few travelers were boarding planes, but as travel slowly starts to rebound, some travelers are wondering when in-flight service will resume, especially on longer flights. (Others wish airlines wouldn't serve a thing, including water, during the pandemic because it encourages passengers to take their masks off.)

Eight months into the pandemic, United Airlines is tiptoeing back in.

Beginning Nov. 17, the Chicago-based airline plans to start selling food, beer and wine in economy on select flights from its Denver hub. The test will include passengers on flights from Denver to eight destinations: Boston; Chicago; Honolulu; Houston; Los Angeles; Newark, New Jersey; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.

United is currently only offering economy passengers on domestic flights 2 hours and 20 minutes or longer a complimentary snack bag with two snacks and a small bottle of water. Passengers on all flights receive complimentary soft drinks. No alcohol is available in regular economy and that will remain the case except on the select flights out of Denver.

The decision to start selling food, beer and wine again stems from feedback from customers that in-flight service is ""an important part of their travel experience,'' United spokeswoman Christine Salamone said.

The airline worked with the Cleveland Clinic to develop a ""touchless'' digital payment system when buying the snacks and drinks. Travelers who want to buy food and drinks will have to store their credit card information in United's mobile app or on its website so there won't be exchange of credit cards in flight.

Alaska Airlines heard similar feedback from passengers, so it started selling fruit-and-cheese platters Nov. 4. on select flights. Platters are $8 and must be preordered on the airline's mobile app or website at least 20 hours before the flight with a stored credit card.

Here's what other US airlines are serving in economy during the pandemic

Allegiant Airlines: Food, soft drinks and alcohol for sale via the airline's mobile app.

Alaska Airlines: Complimentary soft drinks, water and (on morning flights) coffee and tea. On flights over about three hours, passengers have the option to preorder an $8 fruit-and-cheese platter.

Delta Air Lines: Complimentary prepackaged snack and bottled water.

Frontier Airlines: Bottled water for sale.

Hawaiian Airlines: Complimentary sandwich and select soft drinks on most flights between the mainland and Hawaii. Passengers on flights between New York and Boston and Hawaii are also served coffee and tea and can purchase alcoholic beverages.

JetBlue Airways: Complimentary snacks and a limited lineup of soft drinks plus select prepackaged snack boxes for sale.

Southwest Airlines: Complimentary water and snacks on flights over 250 miles. No service on shorter flights. Passengers on Hawaii flights receive water and snacks.

Spirit Airlines: Snacks, soft drinks and alcohol for sale."

Competition in our USA TODAY 10Best Readers’ Choice Awards tends to get pretty heated, but in recent months, one of our contests heated up in a way that none of us here at 10Best expected.

In 2016, we held a Readers’ Choice Award for the Best Po’Boy in Louisiana and the race was tight between two legendary, family-owned po’boy spots: Olde Tyme Grocery in Lafayette and Parkway Bakery and Tavern in New Orleans.

""It felt like we were running a political campaign,"" says Justin Kennedy, General Manager and Head Chef over at Parkway.

Parkway, which has been open since 1911, is one of the oldest po’boy shops in New Orleans. Despite Parkway’s local fame and loyal following, Kennedy quickly realized that being a historic po’boy institution in the heart of New Orleans was not enough to win the competition for Best Po’Boy in Louisiana.

In Lafayette, Becca Murphree was campaigning hard for her family’s Olde Tyme Grocery. Olde Tyme Grocery, which has been open since 1982, started out as a grocery store, but the po’boys were so loved throughout the community, they decided to focus on just that: well-made sandwiches using high-quality ingredients.

When Murphree learned her family’s shop was nominated for our Readers’ Choice Awards for Best Po’Boy in Louisiana, she took to social media, promoting the contest and her family’s delicious po’boy sandwiches. Her efforts did not go unnoticed.

""We were number one in New Orleans but then this little place in Lafayette was beating us,"" says Kennedy, who quickly realized that if he was going to win the competition, he’d have to start campaigning for Parkway. Kennedy called friends and family, sent out emails and even told diners at Parkway that they were gunning for Best Po’Boy in Louisiana, but a little spot in Lafayette was giving them a run for their money.

Locals take pride in food in the same way that they take pride in their sports teams – with unfettered passion. Voting was tit for tat and so was the campaigning.

""At one point, we did a video on our Facebook page and then the next day Parkway would have a very similar video to ours,"" says Murphree, who remembers the video Kennedy published to Facebook being pretty similar to her own. ""You had to get the word out and keep that momentum going,"" says Kennedy.

The competition was friendly, but fierce, and eventually the po’boys at Parkway in New Orleans won the top spot. In a true act of sportsmanship, Kennedy and his family reached out to Murphree’s family at Olde Tyme Grocery.

""We ended up winning by a hair, so we wanted to see them,"" says Kennedy. ""So we called them, picked a date, and me and my family, a few months later, went and visited.""

What started as a cordial meeting between two competitors ended up blossoming into a relationship worthy of a Shakespearean love story. The po’boy-crossed lovers met in 2016, but it wasn’t until 4 years later when their Romeo and Juliet-esque love story began. It was the COVID-19 pandemic that brought Kennedy’s and Murphree’s paths together again.

Murphree’s dad, who is originally from New Orleans, wanted to help out his old hometown. ""My dad said I really want to help out in New Orleans because they’re suffering more than Lafayette is,"" says Murphree. ""I saw a video on Instagram where Justin was barbecuing for people in the service industry. So I sent him a message saying 'Hey, if we can do anything to help, let us know.'""

Murphree ended up going down to New Orleans where she had lunch with Kennedy at Parkway. By the time lunch ended, Kennedy ended up asking Murphree out.

Despite being dueling po’boy joints, the couple has a deep respect for one another’s take on Louisiana’s most iconic sandwich. During his first visit to Olde Tyme Grocery, Kennedy got the shrimp po’boy. ""I enjoyed it,"" says Kennedy. ""It’s different. That’s what makes it great. It’s so much different than what we have at Parkway. It is nice seeing something different."""
140,2020-11-03 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/11/03/cruises-2021-industry-extends-us-sailing-suspension-until-next-year/6133922002/,Exclusive: No cruising in US waters until 2021 as industry voluntarily extends suspension,"The cruise industry has suspended cruises until 2021 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""no-sail"" order expired Saturday and was replaced by a ""Conditional Sailing Order.""

""As we work to operationalize a path forward, our members have agreed to extend our existing suspension of U.S. operations through December 31,"" Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the industry's leading trade group, told USA TODAY in a statement.

The organization's members carry 95% of the world's oceangoing cruisers, all of which, Golin-Blaugrund said, are committed to implementing ""stringent measures to address COVID-19 safety, including 100% testing of passengers and crew, expanded onboard medical capabilities, and trial sailings, among many others.""

CLIA announced the voluntary suspension on Tuesday, which is set to expire on Dec. 31. The industry's previous suspension expired on Saturday, the same day the CDC's ""no-sail"" order expired.

The CDC's new order “introduces a phased approach for the safe and responsible resumption for passenger cruises,” the agency said in a news release.

The ""Conditional Sailing Order"" doesn't prohibit sailing as the CDC's ""no-sail"" order did, but it doesn't exactly allow passenger cruises to commence immediately either.

""This 'Framework of Conditional Sailing' lays out a pathway – a phased, deliberate and intentional pathway – toward resuming passenger services but only when it is safe, when (the cruise industry) can assure health and when they are responsible with respects of needs of crew passengers and port communities,"" Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told USA TODAY on Friday.

Not to mention the CDC still advises passengersagainst sailing on a cruise ship. Last month, the CDC issued a ""Level 3 Travel Health Notice"" recommending people ""defer travel"" on cruise ships worldwide. The Oct. 8 statement applies to both ocean and river cruising, which have already restarted in Asia and Europe.

Royal Caribbean Group, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and Carnival Corp. all announced their own voluntary sailing suspensions through the end of the year ahead of CLIA's announcement Tuesday.

Last week, Virgin Voyages delayed its debut season until January, too.

Sailing suspension continues, but the industry is preparing

The cruise industry has been preparing to sail again for some time, and by pushing sailing off until the new year, they will have more time to prepare and align industry protocols with standards in the CDC's new order, which includes test sailings, among other requirements to be completed, before passenger cruises can resume.

In September, the industry announced mandatory health and safety changes in preparation for a return to cruising. CLIA and its member cruise lines adopted more extensive mandatory health protocols for vessels that can carry 250 or more passengers, which include crew and passenger testing, mask-wearing, enhanced cruise ship ventilation, response procedures and shore excursion protocols.

CLIA worked with Royal Caribbean and Norwegian's ""Healthy Sail Panel,"" other cruise lines and health experts and examined sailings with new protocols in place in Europe.

In October, CLIA made the call that all its member ships would adopt all 74 of the panel's recommendations to healthily resume cruising in U.S. waters.

The industry also announced universal testing on ships with the capability of carrying 250 or more people worldwide.

Richard Fain, CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, believes that the industry has found a way to move forward.

""We do believe it is possible to make it that you are safer on a cruise ship than you are on 'Main Street',"" he said on the company's earnings call on Oct. 29.

141,2020-11-07 00:00:00-05:00,https://www.10best.com/interests/food-culture/why-is-fried-chicken-brined-in-pickle-juice/,Why pickle juice and fried chicken are such a magical combination,"What's the dill with this brine?

Fried chicken has been an inescapable part of the American culinary scene for well over a century now. The practice of frying chicken may have first been brought to the New World by Scottish immigrants, but it was African cooks, brought to the American South as part of the slave trade, that perfected the flavor profile of the dish.

At once juicy, crunchy, spicy and steaming hot, fried chicken is as close to it gets to a perfect food. So why have so many chefs and restaurants added a new element to their recipes? Why is everyone pickling – yes, pickling – their fried chicken all of a sudden?

We’re living during a period that has already brought us a pickle juice slushie from Sonic and a dill pickle-flavored vodka. So it’s really no wonder that all of that pickling has made its way into the global cuisine, be it haute or just down-home country cooking. Call it pickle down economics, if you will.

Bon Appétit has put its pickle-brined fried chicken recipe out into the world, and Food & Wine has its own respective iteration of the dish. Companies are giving us what they think we want, sure, but in this case, the pickle food trend may have inadvertently blown the doors open on a far superior way of preparing fried chicken altogether. Let me explain.

You see, pickling chicken in brine prior to breading and frying up the meat results in a chemically similar process to what raw fish undergoes when exposed to acidic citrus juice. While brining chicken doesn’t make it safe to eat in the same way adding acid to fish to make a ceviche might, much of what happens to the protein on a microscopic level looks awfully familiar.

Sodium chloride-rich pickle brine unravels the alpha helix of the chicken protein in a process called denaturing. What was once a tight, box spring-like coil is relaxed into something better resembling a fistful of al dente pasta. But vinegar isn’t content to let salt have all the fun. While the salt is busy uncurling the helix, the vinegar in brining liquid attacks the foundational hydrogen bonds of the chicken protein.

A chicken breast or thigh taking a dip in pickle juice for less than two hours might not be exposed to a long enough denaturing process to do all that much. Chicken left to soak for longer than a night may break down too fully, retaining the texture of wet, uncooked chicken even after it hits the grill or oven.

But the breakdown effect of denaturing isn’t the only complex chemical shuffling happening. As those protein helix strands loosen and unfurl from their previously tight coil, salt is drawn into the meat via the process of osmosis. As salt is sucked into the expanding proteins, these molecules make themselves at home, neatly filling out all of the new spaces.

When chicken protein that has been invaded by salt water molecules in this way finally does hit the frying pan, perfectly flaky, fall-off-the-bone fried chicken is created. Voila.

From a taste perspective – which is kind of the entire point here, and the reason we’re making fried chicken instead of tearing open a sleeve of crackers – the pickling portion of this recipe adds something that fried chicken never even knew it was missing.

In a traditional fried chicken recipe, most of the flavor is imparted upon the meat via either a buttermilk bath or from the spices added to the flour that is liberally coated across each piece before its dunked in the oil. Pickling your chicken beforehand adds hours of chemical osmosis, in which thirsty proteins literally draw the pickle juice into the meat, followed by the same buttermilk and spice opportunities.

Or to put it another way, think about how good those salty, vinegary slices of pickles taste on a fast food chicken sandwich. Pickling your chicken prior to frying it recreates this classic taste combo, dialed up to 100."

You're not the only one.

While stores have largely reopened amid the pandemic, many consumers are still opting to shop from home. According to a new survey from PYMNTS, a business-to-business platform specializing in payments and commerce, nearly 36% of U.S. consumers are buying retail goods online as of May 23 – up from 29% in mid-April, when few shops were open.

If you're looking to treat yourself to a few new looks but trying to save money, put down your credit card and work with your existing wardrobe. Chances are, you have a lot of neglected clothes in your closet.

Here are seven easy and affordable fashion hacks to transform clothes you already own.

Secondhand style:8 secrets for shopping used clothing and resale items online

How to style it yourself:TikTok is inspiring celebrity fashion trends from tie dye to straw hats

1. Tie-dye sweats

Many are sporting this comfortable and colorful look, but these sweat sets can range from $50 to $250. The look is easy to replicate at home with a fabric dye kit ($15 to $30).

All you have to do is find some white cotton sweatshirts, sweatpants, zip-up jackets or shorts (pre-wash if they're new). Rinse your garments, rubber band them, then tie dye away – with as many or few colors as you'd like. Once you're done, place the wet clothes in a plastic bag (to prevent a mess) for 6 to 8 hours before washing.

So how many colors should you add? Alison Deyette, a style and beauty expert seen on the ""Today"" show and ""Good Morning America,"" suggests using four or more colors if you're looking for a '60s Grateful Dead vibe, but limiting yourself to one or two may help you achieve a more contemporary look.

2. Acid-washed clothing

If the tie-dye is too colorful for you, no worries! You can create a vintage splattered look on your dark-colored T-shirts with some bleach or even stencil your own design with a Chlorox bleach pen.

""Draw a design, let it sit for an hour, and when you come back, it might get a little dry,"" Deyette says. ""Just brush off that top layer of the crustiness, let it sit again, then wash the item and you now have your own white design.""

3. Embroidered T-shirt pocket

If you have a T-shirt that's looking too plain, there's an easy way to personalize your look. With a needle and thread, you can embroider a cute little design, such as a strawberry, smiley face, flower or heart, onto the pocket of your T-shirt. For beginners, it may help to watch YouTube tutorials or print out and trace your desired image for cleaner results.

Because this skill might be difficult for beginners, Abi Patten, a former tie-dye and upcycle adviser for Stylist magazine, suggests using a pre-printed water soluble canvas ($9) you can print your design on.

""Using (the canvas) as a guide, you place it on top of your fabric and sew the printed design. Then when you've finished, you gently hand wash your design; the canvas magically dissolves and you are left with just your design on the garment,"" she says, adding that an embroidery hoop can help keep your design in place as you work.

4. Painted-pocket denim

Your denim jeans might all be looking the same, so try spicing them up with acrylic paint. Whether you want to paint the bottom of your flares or just the back pockets, it's a fun activity to create a personalized work of art that will get you compliments. Just make sure to add a fabric medium or acrylic polymer to prevent the paint from cracking.

""Wherever you're going to paint on any pair of jeans, look for less stitching. The more blank the space, the better it acts as your canvas,"" Deyette advises. She also suggests using blue painter's tape to block off areas you don't want paint bleeding into.

""You can use glitter glues and gems to brighten up your design,"" says Patten, who recommends hand washing or a delicate machine wash for your finished garment.

5. Fabric-painted sneakers

Bored with your solid-colored shoes? Deyette recommends fabric paint markers. Sketch out a design directly on the shoes, then draw right over it with your fabric pen. Paint tape can help you achieve crisper lines.

""I recently used old Cole Haan white leather espadrilles, and they were just a little too plain for me,"" says Deyette, who applied black fabric paint for a black-and-white look.

6. Iron-on shirts

Re-create a 2000s look with any plain shirt by printing out your favorite image or photo and ironing it onto your tee with transfer paper. Keep in mind that it's better to use dark-color shirts for light-color images (and vice versa), and make sure to flip the image before printing to avoid winding up with a mirror image of the original.

Patten suggests using cotton shirts for the best results, as the required heat may melt polyester or acrylic.

7. Fringe

All you need for this casual and breezy look are scissors! It's best to draw your lines first with chalk to ensure your tassels are even, Patten says. Once you're ready, start cutting your shirt, dress or tank top upward and voila!

Deyette adds that a similar look can be achieved with jeans. Just use sharp scissors to cut the bottom of your denim, then use a sewing hook to fringe for a vintage frayed look.

But how does someone, especially someone who's white, start (or continue) a conversation with family and friends about racism and privilege?

In order to help get you started, USA TODAY spoke with experts to create this guide on best practices and important things to remember when engaging in this type of work.

Of course, there is not a one-tactic-fits-all approach to having these difficult conversations.

As Jenna Arnold, author of ""Raising Our Hands: How White Women Can Stop Avoiding Hard Conversations, Start Accepting Responsibility, and Find Our Place on the New Frontlines,"" told USA TODAY it's important to remember that these conversations are ""a little bit case-by-case.""

So instead of a step-by-step guide, we've compiled tips and strategies for different steps of the process, from before the conversation starts to after it ends.

Things to remember before getting started

Know your purpose:

Dr. Amanda Taylor, senior adjunct professorial lecturer, School of International Service at American University, pointed to Ijeoma Oluo's book ""So You Want to Talk About Race,"" in which she suggests to first find your purpose or ""why.""

""It is really important to first personally get clear about why you want to have this conversation, and what you are hoping to communicate or understand,"" Taylor said.

Realize it will likely get uncomfortable:

""We must remember that real learning – about anything – only actually happens when we are uncomfortable,"" Taylor explained. ""For white people who have been engaged in the ongoing process of antiracist learning, I think it is very important that we actively commit to doing the work to support the learning and growth of our white friends, colleagues, and family members, even – and especially – when it is hard.""

Dr. Lorenzo Boyd, associate professor of criminal justice and assistant provost of diversity and inclusion at the University of New Haven, also spoke to why the conversations can get uncomfortable (and some people can quickly get defensive).

""The level of discomfort is going to happen,"" Boyd said. ""Some people are so used to privilege that equality feels like oppression.""

Arnold echoed, ""Engaging in this work requires getting comfortable with discomfort.""

Do your research:

Before jumping into discussions about racism and privilege, it's important to educate yourself on these topics.

""It is really important you do your background research, so you more fully understand the ideas you are attempting to get across or the point you are trying to make in the conversation,"" Taylor said.

Starting a conversation about racism, privilege

State your intentions:

""State (your) intention clearly at the beginning of the conversation, so the person engaging with you is clear about the goals as well. That can help ensure that the conversation is as productive as possible,"" Taylor said.

Remember that discomfort we talked about? Use that as a jumping off point.

Arnold says she often puts her vulnerability in front of the conversation.

""I will say, 'I want to talk to you about something that I'm wrestling with, but I'm not quite sure why and it might make us uncomfortable, are you OK if we have that conversation?' So instead of trying to compartmentalize the discomfort, spread it out. Let everybody know it's coming,"" she said.

Arnold says this is helpful for two reasons: The conversation is never as bad as people think it's going to be if you preface it that way and it invites the other person to do the same.

Best practices during the conversation

Know your audience:

Jermaine Graves, a licensed clinical professional counselor based in Washington, D.C., says it's helpful to use an angle that the other person has an interest in because it may help them to listen or understand.

""For example, if they're into sports, maybe try to give an example that's related to sports – maybe use sports as a metaphor to try to redirect the conversation,"" she said. ""(When) working with children or the younger generations, you may have to bring in toys or little props and things like that just to kind of help relay that information.""

Taylor also suggests using resources that best “speak the language” of those learning.

Ask questions:

""Always engaging with questions versus telling,"" Arnold said. ""Because it always puts people back on their heels.""

Listen actively:

Paraphrasing your understanding of what the other person has said is helpful, Graves explained, because if there's further clarity that's needed, the person that's giving the information can ""try to come from the different angle or get their point across in a different way if needed.""

Use narratives:

Arnold explains that facts are ""worthy to look at,"" but using human-focused stories and examples can be more powerful.

""We have to invite and get humanity in a way that a statistic never would,"" Arnold said. ""As we've seen in our political system, facts don't ever win arguments in ways that you think they would... Statistics often become battlegrounds and it's not often helpful when you're trying to bring people back to their humanity.""

Taylor added that reading books or watching movies focused on human narratives that ""illuminate the impact of racism on real people"" can be a powerful tool when using this approach.

She cautioned that this can not be where the conversation or learning ends though.

""Only focusing on individual narratives misses the ways that racism is fundamentally about institutions, policies, systems and structures,"" she explained.

Other tips:

Graves said going into these discussions empathizing with others and being compassionate is helpful. She also advises ""trying to come in with a calm demeanor and an open mind.""

Things to avoid

Being performative:

""You don't want to let yourself fall for the trap of performing some level of wokeness for an audience,"" Arnold warned.

More on performative allyship:George Floyd, Lea Michele and the problem with performative outrage

Shaming others:

""The first human response of preventing shame is defensiveness,"" Arnold said. ""So if you're setting them up to take them down in front of five people, 25 people, there's no way they hear you. They're just in an ego-based survival mode.""

Arnold clarifies that this approach doesn't pardon anyone who's been out of line, citing Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper, a recent example of a white person unnecessarily calling the police on a Black person. ""There are some circumstances that require immediate action,"" she says.

Boyd added that shaming someone's privilege isn't the goal in these conversations.

""You having privilege in and of itself is not problematic, how you deal with people who don't is the issue that we're trying to deal with,"" he explained.

Cashing checks, napping and more:Black people doing normal things who had police called on them

Interrupting:

Graves said that both sides of the conversation should ""fully allow the person that's speaking to get their points across without interruption.""

Stereotyping:

""I know sometimes we're brought up with a lot of different biases and sometimes it's really embedded or unconscious we may not necessarily know that we have a bias, but just trying to be aware of that when we are having those conversations,"" Graves said.

Making it directly about them:

Boyd suggests phrasing like: ""I'm not talking about you, I'm talking in general terms.""

""If I can deflect it from you, you're less likely to get defensive,"" he explained. ""I often use the term, 'There's a guy that I know.' And even though I'm talking about (someone specific).""

Centering on white emotions:

Taylor says for white people discussing issues of race, it is ""important to avoid letting our emotions be the beginning or the end of the conversation.""

""White people, especially those of us who are newer to the work, often feel defensive or guilty in conversations about race,"" she explained. ""Shutting down, whether by disengaging, crying, or keeping the conversation centered on our personal feelings, re-centers our own emotions rather than the emotions of those most harmed by racism and its ongoing impacts.""

Tips for defensiveness

Find common ground:

Finding where your views align can help determine where exactly your views diverge and lead to more productive conversations.

""Always try to put yourself in the other person's shoes just to try and understand where they're coming from,"" Grave said.

Flip the script:

Boyd suggests ""trying to get people to understand a different perspective.""

""(Saying), your story is important, but can we flip things around?"" he explained. ""Self-reflection is really important to understanding and if you can do self-reflection, you can begin to go toward empathy.""

For example, try re-imagining the country ""flipped on it's axis,"" Boyd explained, where the majority of people are Black (including all elected officials, police departments, etc.), and ask, ""How hard would it be for a white person to try and get ahead?""

Be prepared for common rebuttals:

""I don't see color"" ""When you say, 'You don't see color,' that's amazingly offensive to people of color,"" Boyd said. ""Because you are reducing major parts of their characteristics and their culture to nothingness.""

""All Lives Matter"" Boyd explained, ""When I say 'Black Lives Matter' and somebody else says 'Blue Lives Matter' or 'All Lives Matter,' to me that's akin to going into a cancer hospital and screaming out, 'You know there are other diseases too.' ""

""My life was hard too"" ""White privilege does not mean your life is not hard. It means that your race is not one of the things that makes it hard,"" Taylor explained.

""Not all cops are bad"" ""The question is, if there are so many good cops, where are all of these good cops when bad cops are doing bad things?"" Boyd, who is also the director of the Center for Advanced Policing at the University of New Haven, said. ""So if good cops aren't stepping in, aren't they actually bad too, then?""

""I agree with protesting, but not violence"" ""When Colin Kaepernick decided that he's not going to say a word, he's going to bow his head and take a knee and not make a spectacle... peacefully protesting, white people lost their minds,"" Boyd said, explaining that many types of protest are viewed as problematic. ""At what point is the harm of Black and Brown people – at what point does that become problematic for you?""

""Black Lives Matter? What about Black-on-Black crime?"" ""The difference is, the police have a different level of authority and the police represents the government. So now it's the government killing us. The people that are supposed to protect us are now killing us,"" Boyd said.



What if things aren't getting through?

Remember that these conversations take time:

""It is unlikely that you'll be able to step into a conversation, convert someone completely to your thinking and then exit gracefully,"" Arnold said. ""If you're going to enter a conversation and you feel like there's pushback, just know that's the first conversation of 73.""

Find someone else:

Graves suggests finding someone else who is willing to continue the conversation instead.

""If a mother and son can't have that conversation, maybe there's an uncle...or someone else in the community that that person is more receptive to receiving information from,"" Graves said.

Is there ever a time to give up?

Graves said that it can be difficult to change a person's thinking, but thinks ""everyone can grow and learn."" One sign it's time to take a break, however, is if things get physical.

""If things get completely escalated to the point that it may become violent or physical, then yes, that's the time (to say), 'OK, we need to end the discussion until we can actually have a civil conversation,' "" she said.

How to go beyond the conversation

So, you've had a productive conversation with someone. What's next?

Action doesn't need to end when the conversation does. Some options for going beyond the conversation include continued education, learning to be actively anti-racist, supporting Black-owned businesses, taking action with petitions and voting, getting involved in your community and amplifying Black voices online and in person.

As some experts predicted, Election Day 2020 is turning into election week, thanks to the large number of mail-in ballots cast because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The presidential race between Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump remained too close to call as the country awaits the final ballots to be counted, a process that could take days. And beyond the time it takes to count the ballots, legal battles could follow results – lawyers have already lined up across the nation to challenge voting rules and individual votes.

It was, quite frankly, overwhelming just to vote this year, let alone follow every election update and news development. We want to help you take care of your mental health while you stay informed.

We offer some wisdom, distractions and comfort in what is going to be a stressful week for everyone.

Be patient, if you can

We live in an impatient society. We want everything right now (two-day shipping! instant downloads!) and having to wait longer to find out the results of what has felt like an extra-long election cycle can be stressful.

But preparing yourself for a long haul can help make this week easier. As USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief Nicole Carroll put it, ""The delay doesn't mean there is a problem. It means the system is working, and states are ensuring every ballot is counted.""

Limit your news consumption to what you need to know

You don't need to be glued to your phone or TV screen to ensure you hear important election news.

""There is a fine line between being an informed citizen and making yourself crazy with all the headlines and social media conversations,"" says Dr. Linda Anegawa, a primary care physician with virtual health platform PlushCare. ""These activities can become not only a time suck, but it can drain your emotional energy.""

If you aren't learning anything new and you are feeling anxious, it's probably a sign you need a break.

Do something else

It's OK to spend time this week taking care of your mental health. In fact, it's extra-important to do so when the news is stressful.

""These are challenging times for us all, so it’s critical that we care for our emotional and physical health more than ever,"" says Anegawa. ""It's important that we all fortify ourselves in every sense of the word.""

Mediation, mindfulness, distraction and entertainment can help us relaxk. Here are some ways you might channel your jittery energy into a non-election activity:

You can watch one of the best shows on Netflix. Or Hulu. Or Amazon. Or HBO Max. Or Peacock. There is so much TV at your fingertips ready for a distracting binge-watch.

If you would rather watch a movie than commit to a TV show, here are film critic Brian Truitt's favorites from 2020 (so far). For a kid-friendly option, try one of these 25 great movies. Or a holiday movie like ""Holidate"" on Netflix might be the kind of happy, simple escape you need.

Still need a movie? Try one of our 100 favorites. There's bound to be one on the list that you'll love.

Or maybe you're more of a reader. There's nothing like curling up with a good book. Try downloading one of these top 20 for fall.

Sam Smith, Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton all released new music in October. Spend some time zoning out with your headphones.

Start your holiday shopping. There are plenty of sales already starting, but may we suggest one of these 15 products that will help with stress relief. Maybe you need them for yourself. Maybe you need them right now.

If you don’t want to spend money right now, you could also try your hand at DIYing some of these fall fashion trends at home without shopping.

Plan your safe Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other medical experts have cautioned against big family get-togethers, but that doesn't mean Thanksgiving won't be festive. Special menus (maybe try Cornish game hens instead of a turkey), Zoom calls with your family, crafts and more can make your Thanksgiving special.

Stress bake. It's time-consuming, fun and oh-so-tasty. We have recipes for beginners, moderate bakers and experts here. And if you are interested in bread and want it fast, here are some bread recipes that don't require yeast.

Meditate. If you've never tried meditation before, here are some tips for getting started.

We recently spoke to some astronauts about how they handle anxiety and isolation. Here are five tips they have for taking care of your mental health.

Sleep. It's hard enough to adjust to coming off daylight saving time without staying up too late.

Associated Press

We all know Thanksgiving is going to look different this year. If you're lucky, you might live where the weather will still be nice and you have space to create an outdoor Thanksgiving with appropriate social distancing.

The rest of us are preparing for the fact that an in-person Thanksgiving with all of our loved ones is unlikely because of pandemic safety concerns. For us, 2020 will be the year of the Zoom Thanksgiving.

So how do we make that feel OK?

From shared menus to organized games and discussions, some planning and coordination can go a long way.

""The idea is to still feel unified in some way,"" says Etsy trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson.

Capturing the view

For once, electronic devices at the table are something to celebrate. Think about how you will position your laptop or other device so those dining with you remotely can see as many people at your table as possible. This may involve changing up the seating arrangements, putting more people on one side of the table than usual.

Tech advice:The five most common tech support questions in America answered

Your computer or phone might sit on a buffet, side table or the table itself; move it around as the evening goes on.

Maryanne Sullivan of Jersey City, New Jersey, plans to leave the head of the table empty and put her laptop there, while her Massachusetts-based brother does the same at his family's table. The effect, she says, will ""be a continuation of one long table.""

Feeding distant guests

If you want to celebrate with family who might be unable to cook for themselves, think about how to get Thanksgiving food to their home. If they are nearby, drop things off well ahead of time; provide any necessary chilling, reheating or serving instructions so they can share the meal with you and not get lost in the preparations.

If your virtual guests are farther afield, consider ordering the meal from a restaurant to be delivered on Thanksgiving Day. Many restaurants will be creating Thanksgiving takeout or delivery menus, and you might be able to get the whole shebang delivered to your loved ones' door.

To personalize things further, see if a nearby caterer or restaurant might prepare specific recipes to be delivered. Perhaps your Thanksgiving doesn't feel complete without Aunt Sue's roasted butternut squash, or your sister's famous streusel apple pie? This might still be possible, if budget allows.

Coordinating menus

To feel more connected, create a menu together with remote friends or family. Choose specific recipes, and at least everyone can be eating the same Parmesan roasted Brussels sprouts and scalloped sweet potatoes.

Let everyone contribute a favorite recipe, perhaps. Then, when someone on the Zoom screen says, ""Wow, this is the best green bean casserole ever,"" you can heartily agree from your side of the internet.

Sullivan's family is picking two recipes to make in tandem with her brother so she can feel like ""you're eating the same stuffing I'm eating.""

They are also both laying in a supply of the same prosecco to make it feel celebratory.

""Even though this is a very unusual time, it's still a time we'll remember, and we want it to be filled with positive thoughtful memories,"" Isom Johnson says.

Send out the same cocktail-making kit or cheese boxes for everybody in advance, she suggests.

Matching cheese boards on Zoom? Very 2020.

Setting the stage

While many of us take care to set a nice table for the holiday, and perhaps create a seasonal centerpiece, this is a good year to take it up a notch to warm the homes of everyone celebrating with us virtually.

""There will be a lot more attention to detail with things like personalized name tags and fancy pieces of beautiful dinnerware and glasses, and all the bells and whistles of a very special, fancy dinner,"" Isom Johnson predicts.

For the tech savvy, she also recommends creating a family holiday Zoom background for everyone. It could involve rotating or fixed images, perhaps of a childhood home, previous family gatherings, past vacations. Let the teens or millennials in your house take on this task.

Another good task for the younger set: creating a shared playlist.

Joint activities

Post- or pre-meal games are a great way to connect and spark conversation. There are personalized, online bingo and card games for a crowd, for instance, and many board games work well over screens. You can have some lively Scattergories games via Zoom if you send everyone the word lists ahead of time, and a few rounds of virtual charades are easy.

Think about coordinating a pre-Thanksgiving non-perishable food drop-off to the local pantry. Everyone can share in the good feelings that come with making sure others have enough to eat.

And especially in these difficult times, psychologists say that finding things for which to feel grateful can lift your mood. A week or so before the holiday, ask everyone to write down one or more things they feel thankful for, large or small. Put them in a bowl or in an online chat, and during or after the meal take turns reading your own or others.

How is everyone doing?

We all knew it would take a long time to count the high volume of mail-in ballots in the 2020 election, but that doesn't mean that waiting for the results has been easy this week.

A winner has been called (barring legal challenges), but of course no outcome could have made politics less stressful, instantly end the pandemic or solve all of our problems. I want to reiterate my advice from Tuesday – be patient, take care of your mental health and take breaks from the news. It's good advice whether or not there is an election happening.

Associated Press

Over the past year, the historic Lucius L. Ball home at Minnetrista has transformed from two empty rooms into the Bob Ross Experience, reinvigorating the space where the iconic painter once filmed “The Joy of Painting.”

Ross, known for his landscape oil paintings, filmed his show at the house from 1983 to 1988. At the time, the house was owned by WIPB, the local PBS station.

“The Joy of Painting” ran for 11 years, capturing Ross’ quick techniques as he broke down the painting process into simple steps for viewers at home.

Ross died in 1995, but reruns of his iconic show continued to be broadcast across the country. Minnetrista’s exhibit, in partnership with Bob Ross Inc., will have the power of place.

“I think for the staff, knowing the history of the home, even beyond Bob Ross, something feels complete about having something in here like this,” said Katy Maggart, communications manager at Minnetrista. “Taking this home, that’s a historic Ball family home, and giving it new life feels good.”

Upon walking into the house, guests can read about Ross’ connection to Minnetrista and see one of his original paintings. The exhibit has six Ross paintings in total, and is only one of two museums to hold the painter’s work, the other being the Smithsonian.

“The paintings will rotate in and out throughout the year,” Maggart said. “So, hopefully, every time you come, there’s something new to look at. That was the intention.”

In one room, guests can see and stand where Ross filmed “The Joy of Painting” in a recreated studio setting. Minnetrista worked with Jim Needham, the general manager of WIPB at the time of the show, to revive the space.

From the outdated carpet to the original studio cameras, the room was reconstructed to how it looked in the 1980s. Guests can see, and sometimes touch, Ross’ easel, paints and brushes. There are other small items, including Ross’ afro pick, on bookshelves throughout the space.

“We wanted people to be able to come in and experience Bob in a real tangible way,” Maggart said. “We wanted this to be something people could come in and touch, explore and experience.”

The other room on the ground floor is set up like like a living room in the ’80s, complete with a CR2 television. The intention of the room is to recreate how people originally experienced Ross.

Along the back bookshelf are other artifacts of the time, like VHS tapes of “The Goonies” and “The Princess Bride.” There’s also a collection of Ross items, like a Chia Pet and bobble head of the painter, to show what an icon he was and remains.

“This is kind of a nod to the fact that people loved to invite Bob in,” Maggart said. “Of course, it’s kind of a nod to all of the fun stuff that’s come since. He became such an icon.”

The back hallway also features paintings done by Certified Ross Instructors (CRIs), who learn to paint like Ross and then instruct classes themselves. The four paintings are of the different seasons, and in Minnetrista’s way of inviting the painters in, they have the opportunity to add their own tree to the canvas.

Currently, the upstairs section of the building is under construction, and will eventually house a gallery and studio space. When open in 2021, Bob Ross painting classes will take place in the space.

Maggart said many have asked why Minnetrista is “doing Bob.” For the center, it’s the power of place. Ross almost exclusively filmed “The Joy of Painting” at the Lucius L. Ball home.

“That’s why it’s not a traveling exhibit,” Maggart said. “It can’t be, because it’s based on this space right here.”

Eventually it will be open to the general public, but for now the new exhibit will be open to ticket holders only, Maggart said. Tickets will be timed, partly due to COVID-19, and only 15 guests will be allowed in at a time.

Like Minnetrista’s other exhibits, the Bob Ross Experience will be open Wednesday through Sunday at various times. A temporary 10-month “Bob at Home” exhibit, opened on Oct. 31, in the Oakhurst Experience home, that will feature more than 30 Bob Ross paintings. Due to COVID-19, masks are required at Minnetrista.

The grand opening of the exhibit on Oct. 31 was expected to bring in hundreds, with workshops, behind-the-camera talks with people close to Ross and a Bob Ross costume parade and contest.

“A lot of people come in, and this is where Bob stood and everyone has a variety of reactions to that; some people cry and some people are cool,” Maggart said.

While Minnetrista tries to stay local in the work it does, Ross’ exhibit has received national and global attention, which is new territory for the center.

With Ross generally being a private and humble person, Maggart said the recognition perhaps would have been a little over-the-top for him. Nonetheless, she thinks he would be proud of the space.

“We would say Bob would love this. And that’s why we’ve worked so closely with these partners and these people who knew Bob when he was living,” Maggart said. “We wanted this to honor Bob. We don’t want this to commercialize Bob or to take him and make him something he wasn’t.”

Going forward from opening day, Maggart said she hopes the exhibit will continue to bring people in from all over the country.

“Our hope is to bring people to East Central Indiana, to Muncie, to our community and share with them what we have, which is Bob and other cool things,” Maggart said. “We want this to be a really great thing, for not just Minnetrista, but our community as a whole and our region as a whole.”

Tickets for the Bob Ross Experience are $15 for adults and $12 and will grant access to all of Minnetrista’s spaces. The exhibit is free to members, but they still have to get a timed ticket. Tickets can be purchased at minnetrista.net/bobrossexperience.

'We want transformation':Museums face calls to better represent people of color"
153,2020-08-13 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/08/13/15-things-we-miss-most-about-going-movie-theaters/3360921001/,Remember going to the movies? 15 things we miss most about theaters,"The simple act of going to the movies feels like a distant memory now, five months since many theaters have closed their doors.

Can you even recall what being in a theater was like?

With thousands of titles available from the couch and new releases going straight to streaming platforms amid the coronavirus pandemic, watching movies from home is a popular quarantine pastime. And it’s a good one. But it doesn’t compare to actually going to the movie theater.

Of course, the screen is bigger and better at a theater than it is at home, but USA TODAY's movie team longs for the little things associated with a trip to the cinema.

Here’s what we miss most about going to the movie theater:

There's an art to date night

Listen, it’s nice to be able to pause and run to the bathroom, refill snacks or make your own Negroni. But watching movies at home ruins the magic of a shared experience, especially when your plus one checks their phone or keeps glancing at incoming texts on their Apple Watch. PAY ATTENTION! I want to holler, but I cannot, because it’s COVID date night and it was him who made the Negronis, anyway. – Andrea Mandell

The magical soda machine

Fountain soda just tastes better. With some of the newer drink machines, you can make infinite mixes out of flavors you didn’t even know existed (Peach Fanta?! Orange Diet Coke?!). Each film got a special drink. – Carly Mallenbaum

Absurdly large containers of popcorn

I miss having a disagreement at concessions over the popcorn, and the fact that – I believe – an extra-large bucket of the stuff will always be a ridiculous amount of food and free refills make the purchase even more absurd. But arguing that point with my hungry loved ones, amid the alluring smells of freshly popped goodness in concessions, has become a comforting ritual. – C.M.

Debating the coming attractions

There’s something about watching coming attractions that makes me feel as though I’m an ancient Roman determining whether what I’ve just seen deserves a thumbs-up. My one-word reviews, uttered quietly, are inconsequential but somehow feel all-powerful in the moment. – C.M.

The drama of opening credits

The lights go down. The people beside you shush. The person three seats down turns off his phone. A latecomer scurries to her seat whispering, “Sorry!” It’s happening. There’s an immediacy to the start of a film inside a darkened theater that pressing play at home just can’t match. – A.M.

The anonymous sniffles

Is there anything more intimate in a public space than hearing strangers suck in their weepy snot? It fosters a sense of community. – C.M.

Hearing everything in surround sound

I couldn’t hightail it to a theater fast enough to experience “Wonder Woman” in Dolby Digital, with bullets whizzing by unnervingly as Gal Gadot fought her way solo through no man’s land. And I’d rank the joy of being engulfed in The Beatles’ “Na-na na nas” while “Hey Jude” plays at the end of “Yesterday” right up there with any Marvel post-credits scene. – Kim Willis

The collective spontaneous reaction

Sure, we could all do without the loud dude who announces what’s going to happen before every pivotal scene. But there’s no substitute for the energy of the group gasp that occurs at any movie’s equivalent of “The Empire Strikes Back” shocker (“I am your father”) or “The Crying Game” twist (Google it). – K.W.

Dressing to match the occasion

Movies are the ultimate, accessible event night that require just enough effort to make it special: getting dressed, navigating arrival and giving undivided attention in the dark. When the entertainment on the screen meets what you give, that’s how movie magic happens. – Bryan Alexander

Experiencing old movies on a big screen

Is “Tenet” an actual movie or Film Twitter’s cruelest joke? Honestly, who even cares? We just want to see a movie – ANY movie – in theaters right now. Nothing beats seeing a classic film on the biggest screen possible, thanks to local independent theaters and programmers such as Fathom Events. We’ll never forget craning our necks to watch “Lawrence of Arabia” from the first row of a theater, or feeling the stares of kids and their parents as we bawled through a brunch screening of “E.T.” – Patrick Ryan

Snagging the perfect seat

First row up from the floor in stadium seating. Dead center. Legs up on a guard rail (as long as no one else is in front of you). Nothing’s better. – Brian Truitt

The thrill – and risk – of IMAX seating

Huge IMAX theaters are another beast entirely and there’s a thrill of the hunt to snag the very few best seats in the house: right smack in the middle of the place. Everything else is a crapshoot, and good luck with your future chiropractic appointment if you end up in the front row. – B.T.

Sticking it out to the bitter end

Marvel superhero movies have taught (most of) us that just because the credits roll, the movie isn’t always over yet. While we wait around for a tease of a next film, we’re gifted with the names of all cast and crew – the grips, the craft service, the music engineer – so we can fully understand the enormous amount of work that goes into our entertainment. Viewing at home, and scrolling on the navigation bar to the end to see if there’s anything worth watching, just isn’t the same. – B.T.

Whispering about post-movie plans

Asking my friends what we’re doing afterward as we walk down the carpeted stairs when the credits roll. Plans! God, I miss plans. – A.M.

Eavesdropping on exit chit-chat

Of course, we must go somewhere to dissect the film after sitting through it. But first, I need to listen to my fellow moviegoers' conversations to get a read on reaction to what we just saw. This reminds me: I really miss eavesdropping. – C.M.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in police custody May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck.

The horrifying bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media, showing the officer driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly says he can't breathe.

Four officers involved in the incident were fired, and on May 29, former officer Derek Chauvin was arrested, days after the video surfaced.

If you're looking to get involved outside of organizing in person, we've rounded up a list of ways you can take action from home, including ideas specific to demanding justice for Floyd and addressing racism in general:

58. Work to eliminate hiring bias in the workplace

59. Engage in productive discussions in the workplace

Arranging meetings to continue discussions around workplace equality beyond one-time training is a good idea, according to SHRM’s Arlene Hirsch. “Training is not a silver bullet; it's the beginning of an ongoing discussion,” Hirsch writes.

60. Urge schools to integrate diversity into the curriculum

Teachers can help educate students on racism, incorporating diversity and inclusion into their curriculum.

What do we tell our children? George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor.

61. Encourage students to study diverse historical figures

The United Nations suggests that students study ""the stories of famous people who have fought against discrimination. Study the contributions made by people from all parts of the world to the common stock of human knowledge and experience. Introduce as much cultural diversity as possible into the curriculum.""

62. Bring diverse voices into schools/ Volunteer to be a speaker

""Invite people of other races or colors who are active in community work to speak to the class about what they do,"" the United Nations also suggests.

63. Read about race

Talking to kids about complex world issues can be tough, but these books can help young people learn in a gentle, thoughtful way.

64. Activities that teach about race/racism

The ""National Black Lives Matter At School"" network of educators and supporters has activity guides with kid-friendly language that help educate about race.

65. More resources for kids

The D.C. Area Educators for Social Justice website also has resources for kids and teens.

""The key way to be antiracist is to name, interrupt, and counter racist ideas and actions in our everyday lives,"" Dr. Amanda Taylor, senior adjunct professorial lecturer, School of International Service at American University, told USA TODAY.

67. Tips for calling out family and friends in person

Amnesty International suggests using ""I"" statements when confronting a family member or friend. ""Rather than saying ‘You’re a racist,’ talk about how those comments are impacting you and how you are feeling about it,” their website states. They also suggest clarifying the other person's stance, talking to them quietly and not getting too aggressive, which may lessen the effectiveness of you ""persuasive powers.""

68. Tips for calling out family and friends online

Amnesty International has a couple of suggestions for dealing with racists online, which include ""Deleting or blocking them,"" ""sharing a link that explains the holes in their views"" or ""taking a similar approach to the tips above for real-life conversations.""

69. Influence people in your group

It's great to call people out on racist comments, but don't stop there. You can also preemptively help educate others by talking to people in your own life about how systems of oppression affect marginalized groups.

70. Demand change from brands

Your wallet can be your power when it comes to taking action. For-profit brands need customers to make revenue, so using your purchasing power and your platform on social media and with reviews are ways to push brands into enacting change you would like to see.

71. Question the media outlets you read

Are media outlets sharing statements of solidarity but not actually contributing to diverse newsrooms? As readers, you can question and share your opinions and concerns on the content provided. Sharing job postings and internship opportunities within your communities also helps give more people the chance to make their voices part of a larger outlet.

72. Understand privilege

""It is also important, as white people, for us to remember that we will never 'get it.' We are all subject to racist ideas and we will never fully understand the experience of our Black community members, no matter how much we read, study, think or learn, or how many Black friends we have, or even if we have Black romantic partners or children,"" Taylor said.

73. Question yourself about privilege

In order to understand privilege, you can ask yourself questions. For example, were you ever called names because of your race, class, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation? Also consider your own possible racial biases, which may be implicit even though you think you are being open-minded.

74. Actively acknowledge and support members of the LGBTQ+ communities

Part of the movements and protests is to create space for all marginalized people to share their voices, especially for Black people who also identify as LGBTQ+. Making space, amplifying those voices and defending people in LGBTQ+ communities is multifaceted, whether that's having honest conversations with those closest to you or supporting organizations and brands that provide safe spaces.

75. Do the research

""It is equally vital that all of us, and white folks, in particular, do the ongoing personal work to read and educate ourselves on the ways that racism shows up in our own lives, neighborhoods, schools, and communities,"" Taylor said. Research your state's civil rights history to be better informed about your community's legacy and racial roots.

76. Avoid being silent

“Particularly white people who want to be allies, stop it, call it out. Say, ‘That’s not funny.’ Silence looks a lot like complicity,"" Associate Professor of Criminal Justice, Director of the Center for Advanced Policing and Assistant Provost of Diversity and Inclusion at the University of New Haven Lorenzo Boyd told USA TODAY. ""You have to physically say, 'That’s not cool, you can’t say that.’ “

77. Accept you'll make mistakes and apologize

""Recognize that you might mess up, and if you do, apologize sincerely, and keep learning and growing,"" Taylor said. Be mindful of questioning something considered prejudiced or racist. Doing so does not promote discussion, but instead undermines historic personal pain.

78. Avoid commenting on character traits

“I can’t change my eyes or my hair or my skin color, or to some extent my weight or my height, so things that are physical traits or character traits, we shouldn’t be commenting on. We can talk about behavior,"" Boyd says. For example, we no longer say, “She’s just blond. Or, she’s having a blond moment,"" Boyd explains.

79. Don't perform antiracism

""For my white friends and colleagues, in particular, I think it is really important for us to be sure we are not performing antiracism,"" Taylor explained. ""Antiracism and allyship are not badges or identities, or about woke-looking T-shirts or passionate posts on social media. Rather, antiracism is a series of intentional and ongoing actions.""

Support Black-owned businesses

80. Actively seek out Black businesses to support

The first way to support Black-owned businesses is to actively work on finding them and frequenting them. The Official Black Wallstreet app helps businesses gain exposure and gives people an easy way to search for companies.

81. Support Black restaurants in your area

If you're eating out and want your dollars to go toward Black-owned eateries, there are tasty options to try. Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington, D.C., Brooklyn's BK9 and Minneapolis' Angelea’s Soul Food Kitchen are just some of the offerings available – research your city's restaurants and who owns them. The EatOkra app allows you to search for Black-owned restaurants in your area.

82. Support beauty brands by Black creators

Looking for beauty brands as well? Dehiya Beauty, The Honey Pot Co. and Beneath Your Mask are all options from Black founders that can be found in stores or online.

83. Support fitness brands by Black creators

A few examples include AARMY, Alicia Archer, Ingrid Clay and Speir Pilates.

84. Support Black-led food brands

Berhan Grains, Blk and Bold, Brooklyn Tea and Partake Foods are just a few you can check out.

85. Buy fashion from Black designers

Founder Anifa Mvuemba brings bright colors and innovative branding to fashion line Hanifa; Grace Wales Bonner's eponymous label offers tailored silhouettes; and mother-daughter design duo Rebecca Henry and Akua Shabaka at House of Aama share an ""ode to Southern Creole spiritually and African roots"" with their clothing.

86. Join the ""15 Percent Pledge""

Want to see more Black-owned brands in stores? The ""15 Percent Pledge"" petition challenges ""major retailers to pledge 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned businesses."" Brother Vellies designer Aurora James launched the campaign and is calling on stores including Whole Foods, Target and Barnes & Noble to take the challenge.

87. Support digital and tech companies operated by Black leadership

Baltimore-based RightDirection Technology Solutions, Mobile Defenders in Kentwood, Michigan, and Blacc Spot Media are all examples of Black-led tech companies.

88. Support home brands with Black leadership

Godly Gorgeous, Herpothecary, Pur Home and Rochelle Porter are just a few.

Follow and help amplify nuanced voices on social media

89. Follow people promoting helpful information and resources

Academic and writer Rachel Cargle has shared letter templates for holding your employer accountable for racial justice and resource roundups on social media. Black Lives Matter founders Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza and Patrisse Khan-Cullors provide thoughtful commentary and often share news and helpful resources, as do activist and author Brittany Packnett Cunningham, The Black List founder Franklin Leonard and director/producer Matthew A. Cherry. Teen Vogue editor in chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner has been a mainstay as a vocal proponent of telling stories with Black people, people of color and people from marginalized communities at the center and sharing her experiences on social media.

90. Follow allies using their platform

Celebrities, including Chrissy Teigen, George Clooney and Ellen DeGeneres, have been using their platforms to reflect on racism and highlight organizations that accept donations. White influencers such as Kate Austin have also been amplifying Black voices, making donations and urging their followers to do the same. Illustrator Jane Mount has shared book recommendations to learn more about antiracism with her social media followers. GQ columnist and former Out magazine editor in chief Phillip Picardi often shares intersectional content with his followers that looks at LGBTQ+ communities. Celebrity chef Jose Andres has continuously provided food and resources to assist those facing food insecurities in times of crisis.

91. Organizations to follow

The Audre Lorde Project is a “community organizing center for LGBTSTGNC (lesbian, gay, bisexual, two spirit, transgender, and gender-nonconforming) people of color communities.” Showing Up for Racial Justice is a “national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice.” RAICES is the “largest immigration legal services nonprofit in Texas, focusing on under-served immigrant children, families & refugees.” SisterSong describes itself as a “National Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective.”

92. Wellness spaces promoting mental health

The American Psychological Association has created a list of psychologists available to discuss issues surrounding violent events targeting African Americans. They also have articles on understanding racism and the stress of invisibility on the African American community. Black Mental Wellness provides access to ""evidence-based information and resources about mental health and behavioral health topics from a Black perspective.""

Dr. Joy Harden Bradford's ""Therapy for Black Girls"" podcast and Instagram account provide mental health resources for Black women and a community space to help heal. Sista Afya is a community-driven organization based in Chicago that offers Black women low-cost therapy sessions and other mental health support including group therapy, workshops and discussions.

Other ways to help

93. Vote! Boyd says political action is another vital part in taking action. “Going to the polls,” he explained. “White America just by the numbers has a lot more voting power and a lot more political power than Black America does, so to have white America agree to levels of accountability for politicians” is important.

94. Be aware of overt versus covert racism

Boyd explains that overt is direct, “over-the-top, in your face” racism, whereas covert or “hidden” racism looks like microaggressions. For example, “Wow, you’re amazingly articulate for a Black guy.”

“The covert racism I think could be more problematic. When people are overtly racist, we see them. I see the guy wearing the KKK outfit,"" Boyd explains. ""The covert racism often masks itself as, ‘We’re friends but when you’re not here …’ (so it’s) a false sense of security.”

Taylor added, ""As white people, we don’t have to have active feelings of hate in our hearts in order to be engaging in racist behavior. Even when we have good intentions, we can still cause racial harm. In other words, we don’t have to be 'bad people' to be engaging in racism.""

95. Educate yourself by reading

Reading novels by Black authors can help educate people on Black history and experiences. There are also books that specifically lift up Black female voices as well as help children understand race. To see a full list of book suggestions, click here.

96. Educate yourself with podcasts

Support Black-run podcasts such as “Earn Your Leisure” and ""ForAllNerds."" There are also podcasts that specifically focus on race, including “About Race,” “Momentum: A Race Forward Podcast” and “Intersectionality Matters!”

97. Educate yourself with movies and TV

A few examples are Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13th,"" George Tillman Jr.’s “The Hate U Give,"" Barry Jenkins' ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" and ""Moonlight"" and Denzel Washington's ""Fences.""

DuVernay's Netflix limited series ""When They See Us"" is required viewing for the intersection of race, incarceration and justice in the United States. ""Little Fires Everywhere"" on Hulu and ""Watchmen"" on HBO both weave race and generational inherited trauma into their tales of justice. For lighter fare, Issa Rae's HBO comedy ""Insecure"" shares a slice-of-life look at a group of Black women in Los Angeles and their triumphs and struggles. The 1997 miniseries ""Roots"" is based on Alex Haley's 1976 novel ""Roots: The Saga of an American Family.""

98. Learn from people via Zoom events

Angel Kyodo Williams and others have promoted virtual classes and discussions surrounding a variety of topics. Some are free, others require donations.

99. Be mindful of images you’re sharing online

“There is vicarious trauma in the Black community,” Boyd said. “And it’s not my family, it’s not my person that’s being killed, but over and over again when people of color turn on the TV or open up social media … and they see Black pain, that hurts a little bit more.""

He continued, “So in order for us to let people get over this trauma, we need to stop sharing it as much as we do. I’m not talking censoring, people have a right to see, but the people who share it because of its shock value.”

100. Be mindful of sharing images of protesters

Posting photos from protests on social media could expose protesters' identities.

As concerts are postponed, sporting events are canceled, schools are closed and tourist hot spots are shut down, experts recommend that even those who show no sign of illness stay home during this time of global pandemic.

That's right: It's advised that you self-quarantine.

Although remaining inside is a good way to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus, and is an important measure to help ""flatten the curve"" of daily cases that put pressure on our health care system, it could lead to a lesser evil: boredom and stir craziness.

What's there to do while stuck indoors? We've compiled 100 suggestions to help make your time quarantined as interesting – and perhaps even as productive – as possible.

And now, there's another cooking craze taking the internet by storm: hot cocoa bombs.

Following in the footsteps of dalgona coffee, pancake cereal, cloud bread and other dishes that have gone viral this year, the hot cocoa bomb first exploded in popularity on TikTok. As of Friday, more than 28.5 million videos on the app have been tagged with #hotchocolatebombs, and more than 13.2 million have been tagged with #hotcocoabombs.

But what are they?

Perfect for fall and winter weather, the hot cocoa bomb is basically a hollow chocolate ball filled with marshmallows and hot cocoa mix. The neat treat turns any mug of hot milk into a steaming mug of hot chocolate, complete with marshmallows, in a matter of seconds.

In internet videos, users drop hot chocolate bombs into cups of hot milk and watch as the candy spheres melt, releasing the cocoa mix and marshmallows. Thus, a very ordinary cup of milk is turned into a very quick cup of hot cocoa.

Basically, it's a bath bomb you can eat.

Already perfected your sourdough? Try these 6 creative twists on quarantine cooking trends

Recipes vary slightly but aren't complicated. According to user @honeybobear's video, start by melting chocolate in the microwave, and then spread the melted chocolate into a baking mold. Once the molds are filled, refrigerate until the chocolate is solid. Then, fill the bottom half of your chocolate molds with hot cocoa powder and top off with marshmallows.

Lastly, melt the edges of the top half of your molds and attach them to the bottom half molds. Refrigerate again to seal your hot cocoa bombs.

People have also put their own spins on the trend, with some making them heart-shaped and others making them into spooky shapes for Halloween.

But if this feels as if it's too much work, never fear. Hot cocoa bombs have been spotted by social media users on sale at Costco. There are also a variety of brands available on Amazon and plenty of sellers on Etsy.

For Black creators, bringing moments of positivity to their followers is a break amid sadness, a light shining when it seems like hope is lost.

As many Black people and communities grapple with the coronavirus pandemic (with its disproportionate effects on people of color) and the ongoing protests and conversations around racism and equity, Black creators, influencers and celebrities are providing the space to heal, laugh and connect.

Tabitha Brown cooks and calms; Rickey Thompson dances like he's a '90s pop star; Kerry Washington does yoga to reflect.

Brown's Southern accent soothes and delights as she gives motivational talks and guides fans through recipes sprinkled with her signature phrases ""like so, like that"" or ""'cause that's our business.""

""I think my content has a responsibility to bring light every day, whether it’s in laughter, whether it’s in inspiration, whether it’s through food,"" she tells USA TODAY. ""I want to be helpful to people.""

The actress-turned-vegan foodie and TikTok star is reveling in being herself. Brown made the switch away from a career's worth of acting work and into creating uplifting internet videos after battling almost two years of chronic pain and fatigue.

""I was so sick on certain days I thought I was going to die,"" she says.

Brown watched the documentary ""What the Health,"" then tried veganism. Brown says the diet worked to cure her ailments, and she decided to make more life changes.

""For years, I always covered my accent because I was told to,"" Brown says. ""I always wore my hair long and straight because I was told to, always trying to be a certain look to fit in to what I thought Hollywood wanted me to be. I often think that some of the reason I got sick is because I was suffocating the real me.

As Brown serves up vegan dishes and compelling mini sermons to her 2.6 million Instagram followers (and her more than 4 million TikTok followers she's amassed since her March 8 debut on the app), she joins others who spread joy in their own ways.

Alongside her posts about social and political activism, actress Yara Shahidi shows up on her Instagram feed with short videos of herself smiling and dancing. Creator Donté Colley dances on-screen alongside encouraging affirmations. ""Scandal"" star Washington leads yoga sessions as part of a recent IGTV series (when she's not posting about wearing masks or demanding justice).

For those who follow them, the lighthearted posts are a welcome respite when scrolling through posts about death, sickness and inequality.

""There are studies that show that social media can be quite traumatizing in terms of being exposed to racial trauma. At the same time, people still find joy in the midst of pain,"" says Angel Dunbar, developmental scientist and assistant professor in the African American Studies department at the University of Maryland.

""Black people have done this for millennia. If people can find humor during slavery, we can find humor now. It’s helpful toward improving mental health, but also decreasing bad things and increasing resiliency.""

From hisenergetic choreography to his relatable rants and self-affirmations, it's hard not to smile watching Thompson's aspirational air of confidence.

Thompson's story is not unlike Brown's journey to self-acceptance.

""As a kid growing up in North Carolina, I was shy. I was bullied for being gay and being an extra-loud person,"" the Vine-turned Instagram star told The New York Times in a 2019 interview. ""When I look back, I wish I could tell myself not to change myself. You will be loved for being yourself.""

Colley's videos are a burst of positivity and color, reminders that everything will be OK.

""When I was younger, I tried to get more involved in the dance community, but I felt like I didn’t belong being the only Black boy amongst a majority of white girls who would tease me,"" Colley tells USA TODAY.

After suffering losses in his family, Colley says he had ""a wake-up call"" about using his voice to be supportive of others: ""Because as a Black person, our whole journey is trying to keep all our emotions within because we’re supposed to be strong, we’re supposed to be these tough people – but we’re also human, too. What’s important is letting other people know you’re not in this alone.""

Black joy:Instagram's inspirational dancing guy Donté Colley will make you smile from ear to ear

Or look to Jay Versace. He has mastered providing humor in walking, dancing and expressing himself exuberantly to his 4.3 million Instagram followers. The influencer's content constantly finds new life, often receiving meme treatment on social media (a video of him dining enthusiastically became the ideal of how people said they would ""be eating when the restaurants open back up"" post-coronavirus, racking up hundreds of thousands of likes and retweets).

""Sometimes, Black people can be shamed for finding jokes in things. But negative or positive emotions are not mutually exclusive,"" Dunbar says. ""You can be sad, you can be angry and still have joy and make jokes, and that’s actually perfectly fine and healthy.""

Brown says she wants to be ""whatever it is (my viewers) need in that moment.""

""So that even if it’s for one minute, it’s an escape for whatever they have going on in life,"" Brown says. ""They can laugh a little bit or cry if they need to, but they just feel like they have somebody in that moment.""

162,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/11/09/mcplant-mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-crispy-chicken-sandwich/6187977002/,"McDonald's confirms creation of McPlant plant-based burger, unveils new Crispy Chicken Sandwich will debut in 2021","McDonald’s could be renewing two food fights in 2021 – the meatless burger battle and the Chicken Sandwich War.

The global fast-food giant shared exclusively with USA TODAY Monday that it has developed a new plant-based platform dubbed McPlant with tests of the burger expected in some markets around the world next year.

In a move that could kick-start a new round of the Chicken Sandwich War, McDonald's also confirmed its new Crispy Chicken Sandwich would arrive in the U.S. early next year during its virtual investor update Monday.

""McPlant is crafted exclusively for McDonald’s, by McDonald’s,"" Ian Borden, McDonald's international president, said at the investor meeting. ""In the future, McPlant could extend across a line of plant-based products including burgers, chicken substitutes and breakfast sandwiches.""

McDonald's McRib is coming back:Barbecue sandwich will be available nationwide for the first time since 2012

The plant-based and chicken sandwich announcements were part of the company's new growth strategy called ""Accelerating the Arches."" The strategy includes a commitment to the core menu.

McDonald's also released its quarterly earnings Monday that beat analysts' projections, but shares of the Chicago company dropped more than 1.5% and closed at $213.22.

McDonald's is behind its competition on launching a plant-based burger in the U.S. In 2019, Burger King launched the Impossible Whopper using a plant-based patty from food startup Impossible Foods, maker of the Impossible patty.

Carl's Jr., Del Taco and many other chains also added plant-based menu items in 2019. Author Kathy Freston started a Change.org petition asking for McDonald's to add a vegan burger about seven years ago. The petition has more than 234,000 signatures.

""There are other plant-based burgers out there, but the McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich,"" McDonald's said in a blog post Monday. ""It’s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.""

Borden said some markets will test the burger next year. Whether or not the vegan-friendly burger will arrive in the U.S. and a potential timeline was not immediately known.

""We are excited about the opportunity because we believe we have a proven, delicious-tasting product,"" Borden said. ""When customers are ready for it, we will be ready for them.”

Last September, McDonald's started testing a plant-based burger called the P.L.T., which stands for plant, lettuce and tomato that featured a non-meat patty crafted exclusively by McDonald’s by Beyond Meat.

A Beyond Meat spokesperson confirmed the company co-created the plant-based patty that will be part of the McPlant platform with McDonald's.

McDonald's has also had plant-based options in other countries and launched the Big Vegan TS in Germany in May 2019.

Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, previously told USA TODAY that the growth of plant-based products in restaurants and stores isn't a trend but a movement.

“Major fast-food chains are realizing that they have to respond to this growing consumer demand,"" Simon said. “We’re talking of a mainstreaming of this way of eating. You can’t get more mainstream than Burger King and Carl’s Jr.”

Crispy Chicken Sandwich coming soon

McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said U.S. restaurants would introduce the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich in 2021. The premium chicken sandwich was tested in Houston and Knoxville, Tennessee, in late 2019 through late January.

“It’s a simple build relevant for our U.S. customer base – with chicken, a potato roll, crinkle-cut pickles, and butter. It’s extremely craveable. I love it,” Erlinger said. “More importantly, our customers loved it in test.”

The chicken sandwich war of 2019 began after Popeyes' debut of its New Orleans-style fried chicken on a bun when the chain started a viral Twitter feud with Chick-fil-A and other restaurants.

McDonald's U.S. franchise owners, part of the National Owners Association, said in July 2019, prior to Popeyes sandwich being released that a new premium chicken sandwich should be McDonald's top priority.

""We believe it’s going to jump-start our chicken journey, build our chicken credentials and get people to start looking at us differently,"" Erlinger said Monday. ""We’re excited about the moves we’re making to meet – and exceed – customer expectations for great-tasting chicken. That is how we will start to build our chicken credibility.""

McDonald's has trimmed its menu because of staffing challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic but in recent months has made additions including new pastry items, limited-time celebrity meals with Travis Scott and J Balvin and Spicy McNuggets.

In December, McDonald's is bringing its iconic barbecue sandwich, the McRib, back for a limited time. It's the first time since 2012 that it will be available at restaurants nationwide.

McDonald's to launch loyalty program

McDonald’s announced plans to launch a loyalty program called “MyMcDonald’s,” which will launch as a pilot in the Phoenix area in the coming weeks.

Officials said the rewards program will be a spend-based program, which is similar to other restaurants.

In July, Wendy's launched the Wendy's Rewards loyalty program where members can cash in points earned on purchases for free food. Starbucks recently updated its Starbucks Rewards program and Taco Bell also launched a rewards program.

Currently, McDonald’s offers discounts on its mobile app.

Here's how to get the deal,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's annual Halloween promotion is changing amid the coronavirus pandemic.

After years of rewarding costume-wearing fans with discounted meals at restaurants nationwide on Halloween, Chipotle announced Thursday that this year it will offer a digital-only deal, canceling the costume offer that has been around since 2001.

The fast-casual chain said it will give fans a chance to ""virtually trick-or-treat"" for half a million buy-one-get-one entree free codes via text.

""Over the years, Boorito has become a mainstay for Chipotle and while we can't have our usual in-person event, canceling completely was never an option for us,"" Chris Brandt, the chain's chief marketing officer, said in a news release. ""This year, we've introduced a virtual Boorito to help our fans celebrate and enjoy our real food from anywhere this Halloween.""

Chipotle says the 500,000 codes will be ""dropped"" via TikTok, Twitter and Instagram from Oct. 29 through Halloween.

""To claim their BOGOs, fans will have to act fast and text the valid keyword to 888-222 before Chipotle's virtual House of BOGOs runs dry,"" the company said in the news release. ""The BOGOs will only be redeemable via the Chipotle app or Chipotle.com on Halloween, October 31.""

Chipotle started celebrating Boorito in 2000 with a burrito-themed costume contest. The company then started offering discounted meals on Halloween for consumers who showed up in costumes on Halloween.

In 2018, the company offered a Boorito deal online along with the in-store special but demand online was high and some had issues redeeming the promo code.

Here's how some are making do,"Homeschooling and remote work have taken on entirely new meanings during the coronavirus pandemic.

Parents have been forced to transform their homes into places where they may be continuing to work, while their children have begun the new school year attending some or all of their classes remotely – from their bedroom, the family living room or another place in the house.

Many strategies have been deployed. Some homeowners have taken advantage of record-low interest rates to buy a new home perhaps more suitable for the school- and work-from-home situations.

Others have expanded their workspaces by buying – or building – a shed for the backyard or elsewhere on their property to use as a home office – to not only separate working adults, but also adults from virtual school-attending children.

At-home school:10 homeschool seating options for kids who love to wiggle

But most have taken more modest steps to improve setups within their homes for students or working adults. Several families across the U.S. recently shared their school and work from home strategies with USA TODAY.

Destiny Hamlett and her family lost their home during the Camp Fire in northern California two years ago. Now, her husband, their three daughters and his father live in a 35-foot trailer in Thermalito, California, on a friend's property.

""There's not much room to work with as it is tiny. I found the smallest folding table I could find"" as a study place for the girls, which are in the eighth grade, fifth grade and first grade, said Destiny Hamlett, a stay-at-home mom. Since the fire, it has been hard for her husband to find work, but he does odd jobs, she says.

Burger King Snack Box:New deal with 10 nuggets, a medium fries, cheeseburger and small drink costs $2 to $3

This summer's fires continued to burn around the area since the girls' virtual schooling began a few weeks ago.

""Communication with the teachers has been difficult at times because it may take them one or two days to get back to me on a problem,"" Hamlett said.

Their school gave them a hot spot, ""but it only allows one laptop to get on it. If I try more than one, it kicks one off,"" she said. So they've been also been using her phone and her husband's as hot spots, too.

""That has eaten up a lot of our data,"" she said.

Stephanie Eno, 45, of Los Angeles, bought a new desk for her daughter Bella, 10, in preparation for fifth grade, which started more than a month ago. When schooling went remote in March, Eno noticed her daughter didn’t have an ideal place to study.

“She would be at the dining room table, then on the couch and then in her bedroom,” Eno said. “She literally did not get out of pajamas for four and a half months.”

The desk was placed by a window, with no real distractions outside. Bella was asked to at least dress her upper body for school, and an Amazon Alexa notifies her five minutes before class starts.

“Now she only goes to that desk for school,” Eno said. “I pack her lunch in the morning, so when she does have her breaks, she can go do her own thing. We definitely structured the day much more regimented as if she were going to school.”

A single parent who is the head of development for a small TV production company, Eno moved her work at home setup to the kitchen in the rear of the home, “so if I have calls, I can duck out my back door and not distract her.”

Other upgrades: a better modem and faster broadband service.

“We are now having fewer Wi-Fi dropout problems than last year,” Eno said.

Better internet a must for school, work at home

Broadband connectivity has been critical for remote work and learning.

During the second quarter of the year (April-June), the largest U.S. broadband providers added about 1.25 million subscribers, compared with 375,000 during the same period last year, according to the Leichtman Research Group.

""With the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there were more quarterly net broadband additions in 2Q 2020 than in any quarter in eight years,” principal analyst and President Bruce Leichtman said in a recent report.

During the first half of the year, more than 2.4 million consumers added broadband, the highest first half-year increase since 2008, he said. Overall, about 103.4 million subscribers get broadband from top cable and telephone providers.

Faster broadband was essential, too, for Jared Craig, 22, of Houston, who is a student teacher of second-grade social studies, and his roommate, who is also teaching and studying for a master's degree in music composition.

They bumped up their broadband speed from about 25 megabytes per second to about 50 Mpbs.

""Since we are both teaching from a live video format, we have purchased a better internet upload/download speed, and I personally keep my phone off of the Wi-Fi,"" says Craig, who is earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education from Fort Hays State University in Kansas.

He conducts classes in his room with the door closed, and his roommate doesn't practice on musical instruments while Craig is teaching on Zoom.

Teachers have reduced screen time to 15 minutes of live lessons per subject, so students aren't staring at screens for long periods of time, Craig says.

""Overall, for second graders, I have been impressed with their attention spans and quality of work,"" he said. ""Another issue we often face is Zoom randomly kicking us off. The kids could potentially sit in a Zoom call together with no supervisor and cause all sorts of ruckus.""

Demand high for desks, computers

Upgrading your home for remote schooling and continued work from home hasn't always been easy. Some retailers had COVID-19-caused shortages of desks and chairs in advance of the new school year, as more households faced new realities of school and work at home.

Retailers expected record spending this year, with the average family with school-aged children – from elementary school to high school – expecting to spend about $790, topping the previous record of nearly $697, according to The National Retail Federation. Total back to school spending is expected to approach $34 billion, blasting past the previous record of $30.3 billion in 2012.

""Consumers were telling us they were planning to spend a significant amount more on average, particularly parents of grade school and high school students,"" said Katherine Cullen, senior director of industry and consumer insights for the federation. ""Some of that is fueled by e-learning, but a lot that was from having to plan for multiple scenarios.""

More than three-fourths of consumers (76%) surveyed said they planned to spend on products specifically for online learning, found the NRF survey of 7,569 consumers, conducted Aug. 3-11.

About 37% expected to buy laptops, up slightly from 36%, in a similar NRF survey in July. Those expecting to buy desks for home studying rose to 23% from 17%.

""Lamps, speakers and headphones were another big area, which stood out for us because if have multiple kids learning at home or kids at home while parents are also working, you have to create that sense of privacy and focus,"" Cullen said.

And high demand for home computers may continue into 2021. Total U.S. PC sales rose 42% from March to August, while notebook computer sales rose 46%, according to The NPD Group. Consumers are spending more on notebooks than in the past, with average prices of Chromebooks topping $300 and Windows notebooks often surpassing $575, NPD says.

NPD projects PC sales to increase 49% in the last three months of the year and 20% in the first three months of 2021.

""In response to a global pandemic that has restricted our ability to gather in person for work and education, among other things, many of us have turned to technology to keep us connected,"" said Stephen Baker, NPD's vice president and industry adviser for technology and mobile, in a recent report.

For some folks, adjusting their lives during the pandemic meant making moves. In New York, licensed real estate salesperson Christopher Totaro, 56, and his family moved from Tribeca to his brother and sister-in-law's home on Long Island. There, three adults including his wife work from home – Totaro commutes to New York City when needed for work – and two children attend school virtually.

He has hired two virtual tutors for his fourth-grade son who assist via Zoom with grammar, writing, math, organizing and scheduling.

""It has been a huge blessing,"" Totaro said. ""It is not so far off from in-person learning. The tutors are very engaging and actual teachers, so the Zoom is productive.""

The other upgrade many families mention adding to their lives is more about bites than bytes: more snacks.

Trebek, 80, died Sunday, about 20 months after he announced he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer — more than twice as long as the average patient survives after diagnosis, according to the Hirshberg Foundation for pancreatic cancer research.

Since July, Civil rights icon John Lewis and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also died of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer.

More:Civil rights icon John Lewis remembered by fellow veterans: 'We had right on our side'

More:Supreme Court justices remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as 'a superb judge' who 'inspired us all'

Fewer than 10 percent of people live five years after being diagnosed, according to American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Why survival rates are so low

A lack of cost-effective screenings that can reliably detect cancer for people without symptoms make it difficult to diagnose.

As a result, most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages — often Stage 4, when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. In December, Rep. John Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with State 4 pancreatic cancer. cancer. Ginsburg, by contrast, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2009 that was discovered during a regular checkup.

Ginsburg's cancer was discovered during a regular checkup and, after she had surgery to treat it she lived for more than a decade -- a rarity among those who have pancreatic cancer.

Most people diagnosed with the cancer are not candidates for surgery because the cancer has metastasized – spread outside of the pancreas to other parts of the body. And although treatment is available, pancreatic cancer is considered largely incurable.

The chances of getting pancreatic cancer are about 1 in 64, according to the American Cancer Society. The ACS reports those chances are affected byspecific risk factors that can be controlled such as:

— People who smoke are about twice as likely to get it.

— People who are ""very overweight"" face a 20% higher chance of getting it.

— Diabetes, especially Type 2, puts people at increased risk.

— Chronic inflammation of the pancreas, commonly linked with smoking and heavy alcohol use, increases the chances.

Other factors include age (at least two-thirds of patients are 65 or older), gender (men are slightly more likely to get it), race (Black people are slightly more likely than white people to get it) and inherited gene mutations (found in 10% of cases).

What are the symptoms?

Before the diagnosis, Trebek said, he experienced persistent stomach pains, and John Hopkins Medicine reports that a dull pain in the upper abdomen or upper back is common.

“This is probably caused by a tumor that has formed in the body or tail of the pancreas because it can press on the spine,’’ according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. “Some patients describe pain starting in the middle abdomen and radiating into the back. Pain can be worse when lying down and can often be relieved by leaning forward. Pancreatic cancer pain can differ from person to person…’’

Symptoms can include jaundice, pain and weight loss.

Pancreatic cancer research

Last month, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted “orphan drug designation’’ for a new generation of antibody therapeutics designed to treatment pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer. ""Orphan drug designation'' means special status to a drug or biological product a rare disease or condition upon request of a sponsor, according to the FDA.

“Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, up to seven years of marketing exclusivity for the orphan indication and waiver of certain FDA fees,’’ Apexigen, Inc., the company developing the research, said in a statement.

The use of immunotherapy, the artificial stimulation of the immune system, also is being explored as a treatment.

During my brief brush with fame 20 years ago after my initial ""Jeopardy!"" appearance, it was nearly always the first one I got. It came like clockwork right after the recognition, the congratulations and my thanks.

“So, what’s Alex Trebek really like?”

It’s understandable in a way. People are naturally curious to know if the guy they see every night reading clues and bantering with contestants has the same personality and demeanor off camera.

In that sense, it’s a difficult one to answer. First-time contestants don’t actually meet the host until he walks on to the stage. Even then, we don’t have all that many opportunities to interact with him on the set.

Tributes:'A lovely and deeply decent man': 'Jeopardy!' GOAT Ken Jennings mourns host Alex Trebek

This is, of course, by design. Following the quiz-show scandals of the 1950’s, it became a federal crime to rig a show. Producers have to make doubly and triply sure there is no hint of tampering with the results of any game, so any contact between prospective contestants and members of the on-air staff is strictly controlled.

Having said all that, I was somewhat fortunate in that I had more chances to see Alex than most players who get their shot. I am, therefore, able to offer a somewhat more substantial answer to that question.

For the most part, he’s every bit the consummate professional the viewers see night in and night out. His authoritative style, polished delivery and impeccable cadence keep the game moving, and even the occasional zinger he gets in is all in good fun.

There was, however, a little bit more involved with our encounter. As I said, he wasn’t allowed to meet me ahead of time. But he did have to be briefed regarding my appearance, simply because there were a couple of minor procedural matters of which he needed to be aware.

As the first totally blind contestant in the show’s history, I neither wanted nor needed much in the way of special treatment. But Alex did have to be told that I’d need a verbal review of the scores when a daily double was uncovered. Also, I might not pick a specific dollar amount from the board every time but might just say, “Next in the category,” or words to that effect.

In short, my presence on the set would be something of a new experience. I have to suspect that Trebek was more than a little curious to see how the show might unfold. I got the distinct impression that once it became clear that I could handle the bright lights, which, after all, didn’t affect me, Alex himself was able to relax. I heard him say to the audience during one of the commercial breaks that he was probably more nervous than I was at first. He couldn’t outright root for me, of course, as that would certainly not have been fair to my worthy opponents. But after my five-game run that qualified me for a spot in the annual Tournament of Champions, Trebek admitted in interviews that he had hoped I would do well.

As a result of my initial run of success in 1999, I was privileged enough to be invited back to the show for some of their special event tournaments over the years. I have to say every time I was able to return to the set, it had the feel of a family reunion.

While taping the Battle of the Decades tournament in 2014, Trebek took time out of his own lunch break to introduce himself to my then-nine-year-old son. He was also kind enough to send me a signed copy of his recently published memoir, in which he included a short chapter devoted to my appearance on the show.

So I’m not exaggerating when I say the news of Trebek’s death Sunday comes as a gut punch to us. As my wife aptly put it when he announced his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 2019, it felt like we’d received word about a family member.

All of this is to say that the answer to that most frequently asked question is, he’s a genuine guy who’s very good at what he does, and it was a great honor to have known him. I’m even now having difficulty referring to him in the past tense.

Jeopardy! Will go on, of course. Before Alex Trebek, the late Art Fleming got the country into the habit of saying ‘What is ... ” before answering. But Trebek will be missed, and he most certainly won’t be forgotten."

President Donald Trump has baselessly and repeatedly accused Democrats of “stealing” the election as election officials tally more votes for his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.

There is no evidence of any substantive fraud, refuting the president's claim. But that doesn’t mean the facts will be what Americans remember.

That’s because research has shown that falsehoods tend to linger in our minds, often eventually distorting our memories and influencing our opinions.

“We often remember the content of information while forgetting the source or who said it,” said Lisa Fazio, assistant professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University, who has studied the effects of misinformation. “Over time, we might remember the allegations of voter fraud but forget that they came from an unreliable source.”

QAnon effect? Were voters supporting extremist ideology undercounted in polls?

Social media transition of power:Trump will be a regular citizen on Twitter when his presidency ends

Take a seminal study conducted in the early 1950s by Yale University psychologist Carl Hovland. He showed that study participants tend to believe false claims after the passage of time, even when they originally knew the material to be false.

Hovland called it the “sleeper effect” – the tendency of people to forget the original source of the information but remember the content.

Think about it like this: How many times have you recounted the details of a story or a post you read on social media but have been unable to remember where you read it or who said it?

""Lies, in fact, seemed to be remembered better than truths,"" Hovland wrote.

Misinformation has been used on many occasions throughout history to destabilize political systems, cause chaos and turn people against one another. In recent years, it has been used to foster uncertainty about, for example, whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. (He was.)

Although the facts on the so-called birther conspiracy were known from the time Obama ran for president in 2008, more than half of Republicans still incorrectly believed in 2017 that he was not born in America.

One possible reason? Republican supporters of the conspiracy theory, including Trump himself for years before he became president, repeated the theory over and over.

And lies are especially dangerous when they’re repeated many times.

In a 2011 study, cognitive psychologists Linda Henkel of Fairfield University and Mark Mattson of Fordham University examined the effects of repeated falsehoods compared with facts.

They asked their study participants to absorb information from a reliable source and an unreliable source. The participants consistently dubbed statements that were read to them repeatedly to be true, even when they had been told beforehand that the assertions were false.

“Statements read multiple times were perceived as more valid” regardless of their actual validity, Henkel and Mattson wrote.

When people are already eager to believe something, the effect of misinformation that confirms their biases is even worse.

Elizabeth Loftus, a University of California, Irvine professor whose groundbreaking research on the “misinformation effect” has demonstrated the long-lasting nature of false memories, said the combination of misinformation and confirmation bias is especially dangerous.

“What fairly recent work shows is that we are far more likely to accept misinformation when it fits with our preexisting beliefs or biases,” she said. “When people get misinformation and it contaminates their beliefs and memories, it has ripple effects, it affects their later thoughts, their later intentions, their later behavior.”

Those effects can be deadly in the case of a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization has used the term ""infodemic"" to describe the intersection of misinformation and the pandemic. Falsehoods such as those suggesting that masks aren't effective against the virus are potentially fatal for people who believe them.

Loftus agreed that the president’s false claims about the validity of the 2020 election are likely to have a deleterious effect on Americans’ trust in electoral process in the long run.

“Planting false information and getting people to believe or misremember can affect their later thoughts or their later behavior – and that kind of thing is likely to happen to here,” she said.

Special to USA TODAY

It wasn’t long ago that cellphones were accused of potentially causing cancer. Times have changed, and the National Cancer Institute put many of our cellphone fears to rest. While routine exams and trips to the doctor are hampered by a pandemic, new technology and app advances on our smartphones may be the most important tools we have on hand for screening and early detection.

""I'm going to paint a wild picture,"" said Neal Batra of Deloitte’s Life Sciences and Health Care. ""Imagine a magical technology that allows you to detect cancers that emerge in the body with a tech platform that is personal to you, always on, completely private, alerts your doctor and maybe even ultimately saves your life. Wild, right? Well, it already exists, and we have many emerging examples already radically changing outcomes.""

Pandemic postpones screenings

During the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer screenings decreased by as much as 94%, according to a report in July by the Epic Health Research Network. Officials from the National Cancer Institute said a sharp decline in routine screenings for breast, lung, colon and skin cancers – among others – will lead to missed and delayed cancer diagnoses that could result in more than 10,000 additional deaths from breast and colon cancer over the next 10 years.

How your phone can help

One of the best examples of new tech helping bridge this pandemic-fueled health care gap is the new skin-cancer-fighting app Miiskin (iOS, Android). It’s the first AI-powered app to use full-body skin mapping and augmented reality to digitally track moles, freckles and skin changes over time.

Why is this important? One in five Americans develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Because of COVID concerns, skin cancer screenings were down this year. Though they seem to be on the rebound, this simple, private way to track skin is a huge plus for doctors and patients alike.

""People can use it to document changes in their skin month by month, and then (share those results) with their dermatologist or primary care provider. (Up to) 80% of melanomas appear as new marks or moles, and just 20% come from existing moles, so tracking changes in the skin is critical for catching skin cancer early,"" said Jon Friis, founder of Miiskin.

The app is not a substitute for virtual or in-person visits with your doctor, and it does not evaluate risk level or diagnose skin cancer.

""Miiskin’s goal is to empower patients in between regular skin checks,"" Friis said.

The way it works is simple. You download the app and add your date of birth and email. It shows you how to prop your phone between two books and take a series of shots – either full body or close-ups of a particular mark.

The basic version of the app lets you track three moles and marks, do a side-by-side comparison of photos and set reminders to take new shots every few weeks. The premium version (at $24.95/annually or $4.99/month) adds unlimited mole and mark tracking, and advanced features include what the company calls “Automatic Skin Imaging,"" or ASI.

""ASI uses Apple ARKit 3's technical computer vision capabilities to detect the scene and surroundings in combination with the person to photograph,"" Friis said. ""The AR technology also augments the camera feed with a digital representation of a human being for visual assistance.""

It’s the kind of next-generation tech tool we’ve been imagining for a while, and one I’ve recommended to most of my friends and family.

The mHealth wave is coming

This is just the beginning of a mobile health (mHealth) boom.

Today, it’s a skin cancer prevention app – tomorrow, a tap of an app or snap of a photo could help detect a fever or prevent anemia, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and, yes, even COVID-19.

""If we were to put a true north to this,"" Deloitte’s Batra said, ""it's about evolving from a provider-centric health care system to a consumer-centered system. At the end of the day, health care is about two things: I want to be well, and when I’m not well, I want to get care. This is a massive step forward in the right direction.""

Twitter, which has given the president leeway when he violated company policies, would take away Trump's exemption when his term ends in January.

Twitter's rules prohibit hate speech or posts advocating violence, both of which Trump has often done. Twitter has different standards for world leaders and instead of yanking down their tweets, it adds warning labels.

More:Facebook shuts down pro-Trump 'Stop the Steal' group over 'worrying calls for violence'

But post presidency, instead of being labeled, Twitter's policy calls for the tweet to be taken down altogether. If there are multiple violations, Trump could find his account frozen, suspended or banned.

Some of Twitter high-profile bans include InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and congressional candidate Laura Loomos, who just lost a bid in Florida.

""A critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable,"" Twitter said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""With this in mind, there are certain cases where it may be in the public's interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules.""

On Thursday, several tweets by Trump were flagged by Twitter. In them, Trump claimed, without evidence, that voter fraud had occurred in the presidential election.

Twitter linked to its own guidelines on the president's tweets, saying that manipulating or interfering in elections on the network is not allowed.

The Motley Fool

Nintendo's hit mobile game ""Pokemon Go"" is still going strong and will post its best-ever annual sales this year, according to new data from Sensor Tower. The game has generated over $1 billion in revenue in the first 10 months of the year, which is already up 11% compared with its $902 million in sales across 2019.

""Pokemon Go,"" which is co-owned by The Pokemon Company and Niantic, launched in 2016 and has posted stellar performance since its debut. Sensor Tower reports that the game has now generated over $4 billion in lifetime revenue, and the title's incredible longevity points to the huge opportunity Nintendo still has in the mobile market.

'Pokemon Go' shows what's possible in mobile

Nintendo's management earlier this year suggested that the company might focus less on the mobile market in favor of devoting more software-development resources to support its Switch hardware platform. The Japanese gaming giant has seen somewhat uninspiring performance for some of its recent mobile games, and the fact that it has to pay a significant cut of sales on games sold through Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play to the platform owners presents another incentive to focus on its own hardware ecosystem.

While the company's Switch console has been hugely successful, opting to focus less on mobile would likely be a mistake for Nintendo. The company owns more valuable properties than any competitor in the video game industry, and it has the opportunity to reach billions of mobile gamers around the world.

""Pokemon Go"" now stands as one of the most profitable games (and overall entertainment releases) in history, and its success proves that an otherwise relatively slow start in mobile shouldn't deter Nintendo from betting big on the platform.

JERUSALEM — Facebook says it has taken down several fake accounts based in Iran that had voiced support for protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Facebook detailed several instances of ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" around the globe, in which fake accounts were set up to interfere in the politics of other countries. It said the accounts have been removed from the social network.

The announcement came in a monthly report released on Thursday. It said one such case involved 12 Facebook accounts, two pages and 307 Instagram accounts that had shared content in Hebrew and Arabic about protests in both Israel and Iraq.

Facebook said the individuals behind the accounts had sought to shield their identities but that it was able to trace them to a Tehran-based IT company. It said the network of fake accounts had around 10,000 followers and was in the early stages of building an audience.

Netanyahu and his supporters seized on the report, saying it proved that Iran supported the aims of his political opponents. The Black Flag movement, one of the main protest groups, accused the prime minister of incitement and called on supporters to attend its next weekly protest on Saturday.

Israelis have been holding mass protests for months calling on Netanyahu to resign over his trial on multiple corruption charges and his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.

Israel views Iran as its greatest threat because of Tehran's nuclear program, its support for regional militant groups and the incendiary rhetoric of its leaders.

Israel said it thwarted a major cyberattack earlier this year targeting its water infrastructure, which was widely attributed to Iran. Israel is suspected of retaliating two weeks later with a cyberattack on an Iranian port.

Israel and Iran have engaged in years of covert battles that have included high-tech hacking and cyberattacks. Most famously, U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies are suspected of unleashing a computer worm called Stuxnet that disrupted Iran's nuclear program."
174,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/06/qanon-2020-election-trump-biden-polls/6167059002/,Were voters manipulated by QAnon a force behind Trump's 'red wave' in 2020 election?,"President Donald Trump's stronger-than-expected performance in several battleground states may be partially due to Americans who believe in a radical conspiracy ideology rushing to the ballot box to support him.

QAnon adherents appear to have accounted for a larger share of the electorate in swing states than in the average state, according to a fresh analysis conducted for USA TODAY by University of Southern California experts on misinformation and social media.

Emilio Ferrara, a professor and research team leader at the USC Information Sciences Institute, said voters in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona “have engaged and supported” QAnon content at a rate of “about twice” the average state.

“That is a lot,” he said. “This is something that the polls that were based in traditional surveys didn’t surface.”

Ferrara based his conclusion on a fresh state-by-state review of 240 million election-related tweets from June 20 through Sept. 9 that he previously analyzed in a peer-reviewed study published five days before the election.

Some QAnon watchdogs, however, are skeptical that the movement had an outsized impact on the election's outcome.

""I do not think QAnon activity had an influential effect pre-election,"" said Emerson Brooking, resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""QAnon networks are, however, amplifying some of the wildest conspiracies in this dangerous post-election period. I am concerned about how they are contributing to the general atmosphere of uncertainty.""

Conspiracy theories abound:How QAnon and other dark forces are radicalizing Americans

QAnon conspiracy theories debunked:Don't be fooled

QAnon followers believe in the debunked premise that an evil cabal of Democrats is running a secret child-sex-trafficking ring – and that Trump is poised to break it up. The group also promotes a host of loosely connected and often disprovable theories, often using the hashtag #SaveTheChildren to circulate falsehoods.

In the final weeks leading up to the election, QAnon believers rallied around the bogus premise that the former vice president’s son, Hunter Biden, is “an incestuous pedophile based on speculative and unverified contents from his laptop,” said Aoife Gallagher, a disinformation and extremism analyst at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks extremism around the world.

""It is hard to say whether this had an effect on people's voting decisions, but we certainly came across evidence of concerted disinformation campaigns to get people to change their vote on the back of this information in the final days of the campaign,"" Gallagher said.

While it has thrived on extremist message boards and in the dark corners of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, QAnon activity is not limited to the backwoods of the internet. The group has drawn support from the highest ranks of American politics.

Trump himself has refused to denounce the group on several occasions, while Congress is set to get its first QAnon supporter with the election of Georgia Republican candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene. Another Republican winner, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, also previously expressed support for QAnon while saying she is not a follower.

Despite the increasing spread of their ideology, QAnon supporters can be hard to identify in traditional polls because they are believed to be hesitant to admit their beliefs or less likely to participate in surveys, Ferrara said.

But the polls may have undercounted Trump supporters in general regardless of whether they engaged in QAnon activity.

For example, in Wisconsin, the polling average calculated by data analytics site RealClearPolitics gave Biden a 6.7 percentage-point lead, but he ended up winning by less than 1 point. In Florida, the polling average gave Biden a 0.9-point edge, but in the end Trump prevailed by more than 3 points.

“There are some judgmental aspects to disclosing yourself in alignment with these more unconventional ideas, therefore their responses were not necessarily accurate,” Ferrara said of QAnon participants in pre-election polls.

Additional research indicated that QAnon activity was especially acute in key swing states.

QAnon accounts were particularly active in the battleground states of Texas, Florida and North Carolina, according to research from Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit public interest research group that studies disinformation.

To be sure, in recent months, Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube took steps to ban or significantly limit QAnon activity. Those efforts restricted the reach of what Gallagher described as the “digital cult” and what the FBI has labeled as a domestic terror threat.

But experts say QAnon supporters have continued to find ways around social media limits.

As of Nov. 3, there were more than 95,000 active QAnon accounts on Twitter, an analysis from Advance Democracy found. Those accounts were responsible for 334,200 posts about the 2020 election from midnight to 5 p.m. on Election Day, more than double the amount from the same period on the previous day. And QAnon accounts made up 2.3% of the Twitter conversation about the election during that timeframe.

Two of the top 10 hashtags used in posts about the 2020 election – #maga and #trump2020 – received over 7.1% of their amplification from QAnon accounts during that period, according to the analysis. Even the #stopthesteal hashtag, which Trump supporters used to promote the false concept that Democrats were stealing the election, got a boost from QAnon. About 15% of #stopthesteal posts came from QAnon accounts, Advance Democracy found.

Beyond just amplifying these messages on social media,QAnon supporters were likely motivated to vote based on their beliefs about Trump’s supposed anointment as the person responsible for destroying the fantastical sex-trafficking cabal, said Gallagher of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

“QAnon at its core is a pro-Trump movement that positioned Trump as the savior and Biden as the devil,” she said. “It did this by bombarding people with lies and sowing complete distrust in industries and institutions that people would traditionally turn to for information. We're also seeing the QAnon movement spreading vast amounts of disinformation related to voter fraud and attempting to sow distrust in the results of the election.”

Sony’s new video game console, available Nov. 12 for $499.99, represents a significant step for the PlayStation brand after nearly 26 years. It delivers a whole new look, a new way to interact, and a potentially (forgive the pun) game-changing controller.

Much like the Xbox Series X and S, which comes out Nov. 10, the PS5 is going to solve some of the annoyances console video game players face. You spend less time waiting to load your games and more time immersed in those ever-dynamic virtual worlds. However, the key difference between PS5 and Xbox is the device in your hands: a controller capable of helping you feel what’s happening within a video game.

DualSense: The best controller available

The DualSense wireless controller uses haptic feedback, or a vibration effect when playing games. The concept behind haptics isn’t new. Our smartphones have them, and console video games have incorporated them in some form ever since the Nintendo 64 and the Rumble Pak.

The haptics on PS5's DualSense are the most advanced ever for a video game controller. The left and right adaptive triggers offer resistance, mimicking an action that might require more tension. And the controller will also offer haptic feedback specific to every situation, not just a generic rumble with any action.

Its potential is best reflected in the game ""Astro's Playroom,"" a free PS5 game starring the charming robot Astro. Combined with the audio speaker built ino the DualSense, you can feel every step Astro takes. You feel snow crunching under your feet, and water as you perform each kick and stroke. During one stage, it rains and Astro pulls out an umbrella, allowing you to feel every raindrop pitter-patter above his head.

But you even get it in games like ""Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,"" feeling every ""thwip"" of web Spidey shoots out. The DualSense has the potential to add a layer of immersion we have yet to experience in console games.

The DualSense, slightly bigger than the PS4 controller, also adds some bonus wrinkles, including lights that better signal how many players are present. Also impressive: The controller maintains the same 4 to 6 hours of battery life as its predecessor.

Xbox Series X and Series S review:Are the new video game consoles worth the upgrade?

PS5: The interface is new, too

As for the PS5 itself, it boasts a futuristic black and white design. It is also enormous, even bigger than the original PlayStation 3 at launch. Fortunately, it comes with a stand to place it vertically. The stand also works horizontally, although the PS5 feels wobbly in this position.

Despite its size, the PS5 is really quiet. If you owned its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, then you may have heard loud sounds resembling an aircraft preparing for takeoff when you turn the console on, or during play. On the PS5, if not for the white power light, it's hard to tell whether it's turned on.

The interface undergoes a significant overhaul. It's much sleeker and allows you to get to what you want more quickly. When you hit the PS button on the controller, you open up a quick menu featuring a series of actions players can take, including a Launcher to quickly switch games, friends list, battery life on the controller, power and more. This menu is also customizable.

The main games screen is streamlined to feature fewer recent games and more immediate access to your game library. Media is also split into a separate tab, instead of the TV/video app featured on PS4.

With PlayStation 5 you can diss the disc

The PlayStation 5 Digital Edition $399.99 looks exactly like the standard PS5 – and performs the same – but costs $100 less and doesn’t have a disc drive to play Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs. The PS5 with a drive can also handle standard Blu-rays, DVDs, and PlayStation 4 games. (The PS5 does not play music CDs.)

As you set up your PS5 using the PlayStation app, the console creates a library of your current games, which you can download onto your new system. For instance, my PS4 games such as “The Last of Us Part II” and “Doom Eternal” were in my Game Library ready to be downloaded.

You can also transfer games from your PS4 to PS5 wirelessly or via Ethernet cable or by moving them to an external drive.

Voracious gamers may find themselves quickly in need of even more storage; the PS5 Digital Edition has the same-sized 825GB solid-state drive as the PS5 console with a disc drive.

Adding ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales,"" ""Ghost of Tsushima,"" ""Tetris Effect"" and ""Fall Guys,"" along with the entertaining ""Astro’s Playroom"" (11 GB) quickly added up to 100 GB, leaving just more than 545 GB for more games and apps (some drive space is taken up by operating programs).

Both PS5 editions have a bay where you can expand solid-state storage, but it is not something the PS5s will recognize on Day One. An update is expected soon. You can also store older games on an external hard drive, even the one you might currently use on a PS4.

As with Xbox Series X and S, the PS5 does suffer from a lack of experiences specific to the console. Most older PS4 games are supported here, which should help bridge the gap, as will games as ""Astro's Playroom"" and ""Spider-Man,"" but players may find themselves waiting to find more experiences built specifically to PS5.

However, right out of the box, thanks to its innovative controller, PS5 provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of video games.

Twitter confirmed the suspension in a statement to USA TODAY that said Bannon's comments violated the social media company's policy on the glorification of violence.

""I'd put the heads on pikes. Right. I'd put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you are gone,"" Bannon said during a livestream of his online podcast show ""War Room: Pandemic.""

They formed part of a series of Bannon musings on what Trump should do in the event he won a second term in office. Firing Fauci and Wray should on that list, Bannon said.

His remarks come as Trump has falsely and without evidence accused Democrats of trying to ""steal the election"" amid a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Bannon's comments were posted to his Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter accounts. Facebook and YouTube eventually removed the video for ""inciting violence"" but not before it had been viewable for a number of hours.

Bannon did not immediately return a USA TODAY request for comment.

Ahead of the election, Trump suggested he was considering firing Fauci, who has consistently challenged his false rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans. Trump has expressed displeasure with Wray following the release last year of a Justice Department inspector general’s report highly critical of the FBI work in the the Russia investigation that has shadowed Trump’s presidency.

President Trump:Weighing firing of FBI Director Christopher Wray after election

More recently, Wray has drawn Trump’s ire for his testimony during congressional hearings in September when he highlighted the conclusions of intelligence officials who warned that Russia was actively attempting to denigrate Biden's candidacy.

Bannon is out on bail after being indicted for an alleged fraudulent fundraising scheme connected to Trump's plan to build a U.S border wall with Mexico.

With winter storms on the horizon, a generator can be a great investment for homeowners. In order to prepare for the impending winter months, now is a great time to purchase one—especially this year, given shipping delays to the coronavirus pandemic. We've seen generator shortages earlier this year before Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta hit the United States. If you're worried about losing power during any future storms, a generator is certainly worth its price, as not having electricity when it's cold outside is particularly painful.

The most common home generators are the standby and portable varieties, and each comes with its own pros and cons. While standby generators may be more expensive and will require onsite installation by a pro, they're wired right into you home’s electrical system and they're weatherproof, so it means less handiwork for you when the power does go out. Portable generators are less expensive and can be moved, though it's important to note that the exhaust presents a carbon monoxide poisoning hazard. This means that portable generators need to be set up outside, away from the house, and may require additional weatherproof casing.

In terms of power, the wattage you need varies from house to house and depends on how much you plan on powering (i.e. one room vs. several). Below, you'll find all the places where you can order a generator directly online and have it shipped straight to your door. Each comes highly rated and should have enough wattage to power your basic needs.

This year marks Vizio's first foray into the OLED TV market, and the company's new-for-2020 OLED TV is one of our favorite OLED TVs ever. Today, you can get two of the brand's most popular options—the 55-inch version and the 65-inch version—for some incredibly low prices during Best Buy's Black Friday 2020 sale, which is happening now.

Looking for hard-to-find essentials? Sign up for our Resources by Reviewed newsletter.

The former, which is regularly $1,299.99 falls to just $899.99 when you sign in with your My Best Buy account (it's free to sign up), while the 65-inch version is down to $1,499.99 from its usual $1,999.99.

OLED TVs stand out from the crowd due to the individual nature of their pixels: each one can turn on or off independently of the others. This makes for extremely vivid colors and, best of all, shadowy black levels that are truly dark. OLED TVs are renowned for their amazing contrast and color, and Vizio's OLEDs are no different in that regard.

These picks were already more affordable than the average OLED, despite looking just as good on average, so saving even more via this Best Buy deal is seriously exciting. If you're looking for a major TV upgrade that won't break the bank, this might be the year's best TV deal.

As we noted, You'll need to sign up for a free My Best Buy account to get this deal, which only takes a few moments. Also, don't forget to check out all the other great Black Friday deals we've found.

Apple makes some of the best products we've tested. It also some of the most expensive items we've tested. The brand's AirPods Pro earbuds, which we we named the best, typically retail for as much as $249, for instance. If you've been eyeing these Reviewed-approved buds, today is your lucky day, though, as you can snag 'em for one of the lowest prices we've ever seen.

While Apple's latest and greatest earbuds usually retail for $249, you can snag them for $194 right now at Amazon. That's a total savings of $55, which is even lower than the Amazon Prime Day price drop we saw on these earbuds.

We dubbed the AirPods Pro the best true wireless earbuds of 2020, as we were floored by the quality, fit, design and overall usability. In other words? We loved pretty much everything about them.

They certainly made vast improvements over the standard AirPods 2 (on sale for $159.99) with their water- and sweat-resistant build and added active noise-cancelation, which we found to be quite impressive. They're also far more comfortable thanks to the silicone ear tips, which come in three different sizes for a super snug fit that beat out their predecessor's one-size-fits-all design. Like the previous model, the Pros still support wireless charging and pair seamlessly with other Apple devices.

The only downside seems to be the usually-high price tag, but for less than $200, all doubts are eliminated. You can also get the company's Apple AirPods with charging case for $129 at Amazon right now, which is down $30 from their regular $159.

The AirPods Pro sold out quickly at this price last time, however, so get 'em while the getting's good!

If you have a pet (or pets, plural) in your home, your ears will perk up at this furry-friendly deal: Best Buy is currently offering the Bissell CrossWave Pet Pro wet/dry vacuum at a big discount for its huge Black Friday 2020 My Wish List sale.

Subscribe to Reviewed's Resources newsletter for tips, tricks and hacks to get through this together.

This highly-rated machine has earned 4.4 stars from nearly 600 customer ratings on the site, indicating that it like does what it promises to do, which is to effectively clean dirt, dust, grime, and, most importantly, pet hair, from a variety of surfaces (think thin carpets, tile, hardwood, wood, laminate and even marble). This device both dry vacuums and wet mops at the same time thanks to a two-tank system, essentially functioning as two cleaning appliances in one. Reviewers call it ""life-changing"" and even ""fun to use,"" praising the shocking amount of gunk it was able to pull off their floors.

This vacuum is making some serious waves. (Photo: Bissell)

What sets this machine apart for pet owners in particular is that it works with an optional hair strainer that's specially designed to handle animal-made messes. That means when it's time to empty the machine, which is totally bagless, you can separate debris from dirty water to avoid clogging your sink. The included pet cleaning solution, meanwhile, is made with Febreze to help eliminate pet odors. On the vacuum side, the brush roll is designed to be tangle-free (something pet owners will appreciate, since they won't have to worry fur wrapping around the brush).

At 11.5 pounds, it's pretty light and compact, and also easy to store away when not in use. There's also a long, 25-foot cord, which makes it easy to navigate from room-to-room.

In addition to all these fabulous pet-friendly features, shoppers can feel good about their purchase, since a portion of the proceeds will go to support the Bissell Pet Foundation program, which works with a number of animal welfare organizations across the U.S. to help find loving families for animals in need.

If you own a pet that sheds a lot of hair, like a dog or cat, this is certainly a vacuum well-worth considering. It's been selling out quickly, however, so we highly recommend grabbing it while you still can!

As schools consider reopening, children face a future in which online courses will probably be part of the curriculum. To make the best of this situation, here are some tips to help your child adapt to learning from home.

Studies show that in online learning, parents often take on the role of a teacher. Making school a priority will help keep kids from treating online learning as a vacation.

Research suggests that some types of parental participation have a greater impact on children’s academic achievement than others. One analysis showed that schoolchildren benefit from discussions about learning and school-related issues with their parents and from joint readings.

Reduce distractions

A report in 2016 found that students spent about one-fifth of class time on laptops, smartphones and tablets, knowing that doing so could harm their grades. They check these devices for ""non-class purposes” 11.43 times a day on average. The majority said they do so to stay connected and to fight boredom. In virtual learning, this behavior might be even more common. Social media and web surfing may hurt students' performance, as multiple studies show.

It might be a good idea to limit the use of the devices until the schoolwork is done. Some students may need an adult to check on them.

The surrounding environment can be a big distraction, too. Having favorite toys around can make it harder for the kid to focus. Consider setting up a quiet, clutter-free workspace that is comfortable for your child.

Brain breaks for online learning

Higher levels of screen time are associated with a variety of health harms, such as obesity and depression. Small amounts of daily screen use are not harmful and may have some benefits.

It may be hard for some kids to sit through an entire class. Some children might need more frequent breaks than others. Include ""brain breaks"" in between learning. A young child may need a quick break after staying on a task for five to 25 minutes, said Linda Carling, an associate research scientist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Education Center for Technology in Education.

Allowing time for exercise before your child is expected to focus on learning might be a good idea. Repeated physical activity during school can improve children's attention. Exercise is one of the best ways to reduce stress and prevent anxiety. You may consider having the computer on a raised surface as some children better focus on tasks when standing.

Time management tips

Having a consistent schedule for schoolwork will allow parents to plan the workday and let students more easily transition in and out of school time. Research shows that students who have higher GPAs are usually better at time management. Try to build as much structure and consistency as possible, setting times for meals, schoolwork and other activities.

Before embarking on creating a schedule, there are a couple of things to consider.

Try to get children on the same schedule they had when they were going into school. That means the same wake-up time. Have kids start schoolwork at the same hour they used to start classes.

Observe your child to see what works best. Many children are more engaged and focused during the morning.

For younger children, you may want to break down segments of the class to tackle one at a time rather than having them finish a whole lesson in one sitting. Older students can usually stay focused for longer periods of time. If you have a high schooler, consider breaks between different subjects.

Every kid is unique and it's important to find out what works best for your child. Set some time a few days into the semester to observe your child and figure out the optimal length of learning sessions, the times that they are most engaged, and what helps them maintain focus.

Allow for flexibility in the schedule. Give children a break if they are frustrated, anxious or very distracted. It’s OK to slow the pace, giving your child more time to think and process a challenging topic.

Try to maintain a planner to keep track of all school activities and homework.

For some children, a basic visual checklist of tasks will help keep them focused. It allows them to see the full scope of what they have to accomplish and what steps to take. The child would check off each task with you as it's completed and receive a reward at the completion of the list.

How to create a space for online learning at home As many schools start to opt for online learning, here are tips to minimize distractions at home. ProblemSolved, USA TODAY

Provide positive feedback

Many children miss receiving reinforcement and reassurance from teachers and counselors. Building a reward system can help maintain motivation. After kids complete a task or finish a class, consider praising them.

Putting a check mark, star or sticker on a work assignment can go a long way to encourage a kid. Other options that may work well with younger kids are giving a sweet treat, allowing playtime with a favorite toy or an extra 15 minutes to play before bedtime. For high schoolers, watching a movie or getting extra tablet time might be a good reward.

Be flexible

You may need to adjust your schedule as you go. If some class activities or subjects are more difficult, consider setting aside another time to work on that assignment. Try working with your children on more challenging tasks during the times of the day when they are most alert and engaged. Encourage your child to continue working on the things that come more easily when you are not readily available. It’s helpful to share with the teacher what works best for you and your child.

Help kids stay in touch with their friends

School is much more than a place to learn. It serves as a place for kids to socialize and hone their networking skills. Social ties that students have among each other have a positive effect on academic achievement.

""Children miss school, they miss their teachers, they miss their friends, and they're living with an uncertainty of the future,"" Carling said.

Many children will have new teachers and new friends. For some, it may be the first year of school. Allowing children to interact online with their friends might mitigate the effects of being socially distanced. Though a lot depends on teachers who will need to create opportunities to engage students with one another, there are ways parents can help.

Implementing social interactions into the routine will help a kid stay connected. One example is organizing a daily video chat with a friend or a group of peers. School discussion boards, real-time classroom conversations and email communication are other ways your child can interact with peers. If a child is struggling with a task and you aren’t there to help, encourage your child to try these methods to get support.

Reach out to your child’s teacher

Try to begin this academic year by opening a dialogue with your kids' teachers. Carling recommends setting up a day and time each week to connect. Difficulties with schoolwork and technology challenges are some of the reasons to contact the teacher.

""Teachers can help with more than we really think. And they are usually willing to help. So if any of the issues come up, if a child's not able to attend a class, if the child is unable to complete the work, if it's really hard to get a routine set up, all those kinds of things are areas that a teacher can help with."" Carling said.

A lack of communication with the parent can be challenging for a teacher, particularly in the online learning environment. Being proactive is essential if your child is struggling in school. If a kid has difficulties with a task on deadline and you can work with the child only during the weekends, the first thing to do is get in touch with the teacher.

Kids with special needs

The worst consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are experienced by the most vulnerable students, such as children who require an individualized education program (IEP), Carling points out. The first thing parents need to do is to meet with an IEP team and discuss what strategies and tools the school can put into place to support students in virtual learning. Work with your child’s teachers to identify and remove any learning barriers.

Many children may need more support with focus during classes. Carling recommends starting with smaller amounts of time for an activity. Reward the child for accomplishments, then gradually increase the duration of learning sessions.

Keep in mind that most phones and laptops have built-in technology that can aid kids with special needs. For example, read aloud or text-to-speech can help struggling readers, and speech-to-text can help struggling writers.

Every kid is unique and it's important to find out what works for best for your child. Set some time a few days into the semester to observe them and figure out the optimal length of learning sessions, the times that they are most engaged, and what helps them maintain focus."

Special for The Republic

QUESTION: I’ve tried satellite internet in the past in my RV and it was terrible, so will Starlink be any better and worth considering?

ANSWER: If you live in an underserved rural area or travel in an RV to areas with no cell signal, satellite internet has been an expensive, low-performance option that some use out of necessity.

Typical satellite internet services offer slow speeds and high-latency because of the limitations of traditional satellite networks that are far away from the earth.

Elon Musk aims to change all that with the Starlink network.

What is Starlink?

Starlink is an effort by SpaceX to create a whole new option for high-speed internet access anywhere in the world with the goal to offer service comparable to mid to high-speed options that exist in most urban and suburban areas.

Starlink's key difference is that it will be utilizing thousands of low-orbit small table-size satellites, which will provide faster transmission rates over the older high-orbit satellite networks.

Instead of orbiting at over 22,000 miles above the earth, Starlink will be orbiting at 340 miles.

Election 2020:Misinformation, fraud claims threaten to distort Americans' views of the democratic process

PlayStation 5 review:A powerhouse video game console with innovative controls

The high-orbit HughesNet has a maximum speed of 25 megabits per second in perfect conditions with the more likely speeds being almost half of that, while Starlink is touting their initial speeds will be between 50-150 Mbps when it becomes available.

Initial reports from those that have been able to test the service suggest that both download and upload speeds were significantly better than existing options.

The more important spec being publicized is their much lower latency of 20-40 millisecond vs. the typical 500-700 milliseconds from existing satellite internet services.

Latency is a measurement of the response time when making a request on the internet — the lower, the better. It has as much to do with how fast things load as high download speeds.

Think of low latency as fewer stoplights on a trip through town. Driving a 200 mph Ferrari that has to constantly stop at stoplights will take longer than a smart car that takes an alternative route with far fewer stoplights.

The eventual goal is to have a large enough number of satellites to create a mega-constellation that covers the entire globe.

What will it cost?

The initial monthly rate for the service is going to be $99 with the additional one-time cost for the hardware kit of $499, which consists of the satellite terminal, a mounting tripod and a Wi-Fi router.

Starlink is calling their current phase the ""Better Than Nothing Beta"" test to try to manage expectations of their service that could include ‘brief periods of no connectivity at all’.

One of the parameters of service that hasn’t been confirmed is whether there will be a data cap like the other satellite providers employ.

As with any new technology, waiting until things settle in allows you to avoid the aggravation associated with using ‘bleeding edge’ technology as it works out the kinks, but it’s understandable why this technology is creating a lot of buzz for those that live full-time in RVs.

If you want to stay up to date with their progress as well as areas of availability, you can sign up for email updates at starlink.com.

Special to USA TODAY

One of the more important numbers governing your online experience might as well be 404-ed on many internet providers’ sites. You might not like learning that upload speeds at the cable providers responsible for most Americans’ connectivity far lag download speeds.

That should not be an issue for users who typically consume more online than they create – a scenario that many providers say dominates their usage. For people working from home since the onset of the pandemic, a slower uplink can degrade their digital time, especially if a home sees multiple video-chat sessions in such apps as Zoom (which recommends uplinks of 2 megabits per second).

At the websites of the five largest cable operators, upload speeds almost never get the same billing as download speeds; at worst, you may need to look up a technical support document.

Comcast, the nation’s largest internet provider with 27.8 million residential broadband customers, doesn’t list upload speeds if you check for its Xfinity service at an address or order service at its site. Comcast closed the Amazon storefront that provided those details four years ago.

A network management document includes a table of upload speeds that range from 768 kilobits per second on its slowest plans to 35 Mbps on its 1-gigabit-per-second service, the fastest it sells online. That document is more than a year old, and spokesman Joel Shadle said Xfinity’s minimum upload on new connections is 3 Mbps.

Spectrum, the second-largest provider, also doesn’t list upload speeds if you check for or order service. A network disclosure page says they run from 4 to 35 Mbps, and a rate card page will reveal which ones are available at a given street address.

Fortunately, checking for service availability from Cox's home page leads to a list of speed tiers that feature downloads and uploads; the latter start at 3 Mbps and top out at 35 Mbps. A separate note about speeds and data plans reports that in some areas, Cox offers symmetric services with 500 and 940 Mbps down and up. Spokesman Todd Smith said it provides those speeds where it’s newly built out service.

Shopping for Altice’s Optimum-branded service from its home page shows only download speeds. A separate page listing its speed tiers offers upload rates behind a “Details” link: 35 to 50 Mbps, aside from some markets – “select areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut,” spokesman Ashwin Bhandari emailed – where it offers symmetric 940 Mbps connections.

Finally, Mediacom Cable lists its upload speeds next to its download speeds – even in the same type size! They start at 5 Mbps and max out at 50 Mbps.

Cable operators – the dominant broadband option in America, holding almost 70% of the market in Leichtman Research Group’s count – are working to roll out modest upload speed increases in the short run. A more comprehensive set of system upgrades, in limited trials at such firms as Comcast and Mediacom, hold out the promise of fully symmetric connections to match those of the fiberoptic services that remain out of reach of most Americans.

The invitation was sent out Monday, cryptically titled ""One More Thing,"" and no other information but that it starts at 1 p.m. ET.

Apple's September event focused on the iPad, Apple Watch and Apple's One bundled subscription offering, with the October event all about the new HomePod Mini speaker, to take on Amazon and Google and the new editions of the iPhone. Which leaves computers as the last remaining portion of the portfolio.

This year, Apple said it would replace the Intel computer chips it has used for many years to power Apple computers with chips of its own, and that they would be seen by the end of the year.

At the time of Apple's June reveal, the company called it ""the biggest leap ever for the Mac,"" one that would bring more power to Mac computers, and and better battery life on its laptops.

""Apple silicon will make the Mac stronger and more capable than ever,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in announcing the move.

The idea was to use the same chip set on Apple phones, tablets and computers and make it easier for developers to create apps that didn't have to be adjusted to be accessed on the computer.

Apple on Oct. 13 just released two editions of the new iPhone, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, selling for $799 and $999. Two more iPhone editions are slated for release on Nov. 13, the iPhone 12 Mini, a smaller and less expensive version ($699) of the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099) a bigger (6.9 inches) edition of the 12 Pro, with larger pixels to appeal to photographers.

My windows frosted over last night, and this morning I woke to a sheet of snow on the ground. I'm remaking my bed in flannel, putting my softest cover on my comforter, and getting ready to semi-hibernate.

It’s no joke when I say I need a good comforter to survive the winter. Comforters are pretty magical. With the right one, you won’t have to filch extra blankets from the couch even one time this year. The ideal comforter is soft, strong, evenly weighted, and warm.

Home Depot might not be on your radar when it comes to comforters, but it definitely should be. Home Depot is one of my favorite places to get affordable, high-quality household goods, and they’ve got an impressive range of popular, long-lasting bed linens. But every blanket is a little different, and not every Home Depot-sold comforter is created equal. If you’re thinking about getting a comforter from Home Depot, here’s what you should know.

What kind of comforters does Home Depot sell?

Credit: The Company Store Home Depot stocks loads of different brands and some hold up much better than others.

Home Depot has lots of comforters. Comforters in bright colors, comforters in classic white, comforters filled with down, hypoallergenic comforters with alternative stuffing, comforters from small brands and popular ones—if you know exactly what you’re looking for, you’re likely to find it here.

These options are directed at a huge range of budgets, from high-end comforters stuffed with premium Hungarian goose down that go for almost $1,050, to lightweight, 100% polyester comforters that promise year-round warmth for just over $20. The most popular brands that Home Depot carries are StyleWell and Home Decorators Collection, which is also responsible for a set of sheets we’ve been loving recently. But no comforter is a perfect match for every sleepy shopper. With a little more information about the strengths and weaknesses of different brands, you can make savvy decisions about whether a new comforter from Home Depot is right for you.

Are comforters from Home Depot any good?

With so much variety in design, material, and price, it’s probably obvious that some of these comforters are better investments than others. We’ve tried out four of the most popular comforters Home Depot sells, and we’ve found both winners and duds.

Alberta from The Company Store

Credit: Credit: Reviewed / Camryn Rabideau The super fluffy Alberta is our favorite down comforter on the market.

The Alberta comforter from The Company Store is one of our absolute favorite comforters right now, and our number one pick when it comes to down-filled options. We found that this comforter is incredibly fluffy and comfortable, and curling up with it is a seriously luxurious experience. It comes in three different weights, each one stuffed with toasty warm duck down. The down stays evenly distributed inside the shell, and the medium-warmth option feels like it will work all year round. It also has the pretty remarkable distinction of being machine-washable despite its genuine down stuffing, which makes it an unusual find. We only have two pieces of criticism: the exterior isn’t as soft as some competitors, and it is prone to wrinkling. If you, like me, prefer to use a duvet cover anyway, there’s really nothing bad to say about this comforter.

Larkspur from The Home Decorators Collection

Credit: Reviewed / Camryn Rabideau Despite the many positive reviews, we were disappointed with the Larkspur bed set.

After noticing that this 5-piece comforter set has reviews just as good as our beloved Alberta, we knew we had to try it. Unfortunately, this set was a miss for us. In our tests we found that while the set was attractive, the comforter itself wasn't as soft as competitors. Most importantly, it was definitely not warm enough for a cold winter night. Our tester tried this one in July and reported back that it was perfect for summer. It wins points for its beautiful design and for including cute throw pillows, but there’s no reason to spend money on a comforter set that won’t keep you warm.

Sweeney from StyleWell

Credit: Home Depot We liked the StyleWell, but it's probably best for summer and fall.

Our shopping editor Courtney Campbell tried out a popular 5-piece comforter set from StyleWell to see if it could live up to the reviews. This set came with two throw pillows, two pillow shams, and the polyester-filled comforter itself, all printed with a coordinated design. Courtney liked this set, reporting that it was soft and lightweight. She liked the diversity of pattern options and the fact that the matching set made it super easy to style a pretty, pulled-together bed. Courtney found that the comforter was “light, yet warm,” making it just right for cool nights in summer and fall, but she stopped short of committing to sticking with it all winter. A slightly lightweight comforter can be great for certain buyers and climates, though—Courtney noted that “I never felt overheated or woke up sweating, which is always a plus.” She also loved that this set was machine-washable, which is more common with down-alternative comforters.

Year Round Warmth from Blue Ridge

Credit: Reviewed / Tessa Bahoosh The Blue Ridge comforter was fairly soft, but I still preferred it with a duvet cover.

I’ve spent the past few weeks sleeping with this down alternative comforter from Blue Ridge. Overall, it’s been a big win. The filling is polyester fiber, which is designed to stay fluffy for years, and it won’t aggravate allergies. Another benefit of synthetic stuffing is that this comforter (unlike the other one in my possession) will never shed feathers. The comforter shell is 350 thread cotton, and it feels fairly nice to the touch—but definitely not as nice as my microfiber bedsheets. I personally prefer to use a duvet cover over my comforters, so I wasn’t particularly picky about the feeling of the exterior.

This comforter has been the only blanket on my bed for weeks, and I haven’t had any regrets. It’s kept me nice and warm, the filling has stayed evenly distributed, and like the StyleWell, it’s machine-washable. That being said, I do expect I'll add another blanket now that the snow is here—I am definitely a cold sleeper, and I love the feeling of being crushed under a thousand cozy covers. (You too? Check out our favorite weighted blankets.) I will probably pile my bed with layers this winter, as is my tradition, and I don’t think the Black Ridge alone would be quite enough for me on the very coldest nights. For the rest of the year, though, it’s just right.

So, should you buy a comforter from Home Depot?

Credit: Home Depot Home Depot has plenty of high-quality products, but be careful to make sure you know what you're getting.

Is a comforter from Home Depot worth it? With so many factors to consider and brands to browse, the only possible answer is maybe. We’ve barely scratched the surface of comforters that Home Depot offers, and the lesson we took from our tests is that these comforters really need to be judged on their individual merit.

Try thinking through what you want from a comforter, and then carefully reading reviews with those requirements in mind. If you’re looking for a heavy-duty comforter to keep you toasty through serious snowstorms, be wary of positive reviews that mostly talk about appearance or softness. Genuine down will almost always outshine alternatives when it comes to warmth, but polyester and other synthetic alternatives are usually easier to wash, more affordable, and less likely to poke through the fabric. Are you prone to frozen toes, or are you more worried about night sweats? Do you want to be able to use your comforter in summer, or is it an item you only take out in December?

Ask yourself some core questions, read reviews, and stick with more popular brands. A good comforter is an investment, and the right one should keep you warm and happy for years to come.

Plenty of features

Impressively slim design Cons Stunted overhead effects

Buggy Alexa performance

Pricey compared to its sibling

Samsung has diversified its Dolby Atmos lineup significantly since its first entry, the $1,500 5.1.4-channel HW-K950, now offering a slew of Atmos options to fit a wider array of setups (and budgets). An iteration of 2019’s Q70R, the two-piece Q800T is pared down when compared to flagship Atmos setups with surround speakers, offering just a bar and subwoofer combo. While there are a few big competitors in its class (including Sonos' brilliant Arc and LG's loaded SN9YG), the bar’s top competition for value may come from within: Samsung’s much cheaper HW-Q70T stacks up extremely similarly, with just a few notable differences. Here's how it all breaks down.

About the Samsung HW-Q800T soundbar

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

Before we dig in, a quick look at the HW-Q800T’s basic specs:

Height x Width x Depth: 2.4 x 38.6 x 4.5 inches (bar), 15.9 x 8.1 x 15.9 inches (sub)

Amazon Alexa built in Sound formats: Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital+, Dolby TrueHD, DTS:X, DTS Digital Surround

Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital+, Dolby TrueHD, DTS:X, DTS Digital Surround Video support: 4K/HDR passthrough including Dolby Vision and HDR10+

The HW-Q800T supports both major “3D” surround formats in both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. A 3.1.2-channel system, the bar offers left, center, and right channels at the front, a side-firing wireless subwoofer, and dual upfiring channels to create the hemispheric effect for which Dolby Atmos and its contemporaries are prized.

ADVERTISEMENT

But the Q800T does Atmos differently than competitors. Instead of a traditional driver for each of its dual height channels, it employ's Samsung’s Acoustic Beam technology, a series of up-firing sonic chambers designed to work similarly to the keyholes of a flute. As we’ll explore below, this offers both plusses and minuses when it comes to its performance.

Along with the bar, the HW-Q800T ships with a basic manual, power cables, a wand-style remote, an HDMI cable, and mounting brackets.

What we like

A surprisingly small footprint

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

As touched on above, the Q800T is impressively compact for a Dolby Atmos bar, especially one without any surround speakers to spread the soundstage around (though you can add Samsung’s wireless rear surround kit for around $180). At just over 38-inches across and 2.4 inches high, its cut to fit on most TV consoles without obscuring your TV screen like Sonos’ beefy Arc.

Set in all black, the bar looks good (if basic) on the mantle. The only notable issue is that the fully perforated cover is a styrofoam magnet; I was never able to remove all the little white bits without resorting to tweezers.

Slick and simple control

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

Samsung has stuck with its wand-style remote for its soundbars (and many of its TVs) for years now, and there’s good reason. The remote is attractive and well laid out, with tactile keys for both subwoofer and volume levels that feel like those electric window switches on your parents’ old station wagon—in a good way.

I was also perplexed to see no power key on the soundbar's topside controls but, importantly, there is a mute key to keep Alexa’s nose out of your business.

Samsung’s Adaptive Sound mode works pretty well to automatically optimize the bar for most content, and I only occasionally switched to the Standard mode for a bit more clarity. I found a good balance by simply raising the adjustable center channel by 1 point, which allowed for clear dialogue across genres. The bar auto switches to your input source when you dial something up, meaning you can usually just stick with your TV remote for basic control when connected via HDMI eARC/ARC (required to source Dolby Atmos).

A (nearly) comprehensive feature set

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

The Q800T offers just about everything you’d expect in a new bar that nips at the $1,000 price point. That includes WiFi streaming alongside built-in Alexa support to control basic playback and a litany of smart features. For connection, the bar offers a spare HDMI input to source Dolby Atmos directly from a Blu-ray player or game console (something Sonos’ Arc doesn’t have), as well as HDMI eARC connection. The latter allows you to source full-resolution audio from your TV via HDMI, as well as adjust audio sync issues—provided you’ve got a newer TV that also supports eARC.

The Q800T also supports HDR passthrough, including both the newer HDR10+ format (which Samsung champions) as well as Dolby Vision, though Samsung doesn’t list it in the specs. It will decode Dolby Atmos in both compressed Dolby Digital Plus (for streaming from your TV) and uncompressed Dolby TrueHD, as well as DTS Surround Sound and DTS:X, though the latter is seemingly going extinct.

While I wasn't able to test this feature, the Q800T also features Samsung's Q Symphony, designed to incorporate select Samsung QLED TV speakers into the soundstage. The only notable omissions are WiFi add-ons like Chromecast and AirPlay 2 support and a 3.5mm analog input—handy for connecting legacy devices like turntables, but increasingly rare in 2020.

Detailed, powerful, and dimensional sound

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

While the sound signature is notably light in the midrange, the Q800T sounds quite good, even when playing back standard fare like sitcoms. There’s plenty of detail, light and lyrical treble response, and impressive balance, to the point that I rarely found myself pumping the sound up or down between the loudest and quietest moments. Feed it something of higher quality and things get even more intriguing.

One of my favorite Blu-ray test discs, Sam Mendes' Skyfall, offered a brilliant palette on which the Q800T’s skill set flourished. Dialogue rang through with pristine clarity, gunshots were punchy and full in all the right ways, and dynamic scenes like the epic helicopter crash toward the climax proved this little bar has plenty of oomph. While the hefty subwoofer hammers home the vibrant thump demanded in such scenes with accuracy and aplomb, it’s the intricate placement and wide expansion of the soundstage up front that really called my attention.

I’d wholly forgotten about Samsung’s Acoustic Beam technology, which first rolled out in a gaming soundbar at CES a couple of years back. From the start I was caught off guard by how well the beaming tech builds the soundstage up front, seeming to project the effects both vertically and horizontally like a sonic light show. Even if most of the sound is confined to the front of the room, it pulls you into the action, allowing you to bask in precisely placed ambient details and yet never miss a line of dialogue.

Streaming music over Spotify Connect via WiFi provides a similar, if more toned-down, effect. The Q800T places even stereo tracks along the vertical plane with care, dropping an acoustic guitar to the upper left here, a Hammond organ whirling to the lower right there. As you'd expect from its compact speakers, the bar's lighter sound means acoustic instruments sound less natural than what you’ll get from traditional speakers, as well as the Sonos Arc's bulbous tube. Still, the Q800T sounds more organic and sumptuous than LG’s ultra-thin SN9YG, especially in the upper midrange.

What we don’t like

Overhead effects fall flat

Credit: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar

The flipside of the Acoustic Beam coin, in my experience at least, is that the overhead immersion you expect from a soundbar with upfiring drivers is significantly diluted. Playing my go-to Dolby Atmos demo discs, I found myself waiting in vain for effects to effectively rain down upon me. From shards of glass to a jungle thunder storm, the overhead trick so integral to creating the hemispheric immersion of Atmos is stunted here. Turning the height channels up didn't help much, instead making effects sound strained.

How much this matters may depend on how much Atmos content you watch—it's still relatively limited on most streaming services. I should also note that Atmos content like Marvel's Ant-Man on Disney+ still sounds compelling and dynamic even without the striking overhead effects.

ADVERTISEMENT

Unlike its Sonos and LG rivals I keep referencing, the Q800T also foregoes side-firing drivers. This further diminishes the immersion level you’ll get from Dolby Atmos and other surround sound content; swirling effects are cut off starkly before they curl behind you, and those designed to blow past you from behind seem to just suddenly appear at the front of the room, breaking the illusion.

Display and interface could be friendlier

As soundbars (even of the Dolby Atmos variety) get increasingly compact I’ve become used to digital displays creeping out of the picture—Sonos soundbars offer nothing more than a color-coded LED strip. Still, while it’s a small gripe, the words crossing the Q800T’s compact display keep you waiting to identify them like a skywriter when adjusting settings. And when compared to Sonos, the backup display in the form of Samsung’s SmartThings app is relatively rudimentary.

Alexa integration is buggy

While Alexa responds dutifully when you bark out commands (if you’re into that) there seems to be no way to quiet her down when she barks back. That’s fine for content at the same volume level, but depending on the content it can be a problem. When I streamed The Office on Netflix, for example, it was about half as loud as Alexa, resulting in her shouting responses with biting force. A Samsung rep tells me this may be caused by a known bug for Alexa when connected to a hardwired digital source, which he expects to be corrected in a firmware update.

However, even when connected over WiFi, Alexa integration had issues. The main hangup again seemed to be balancing the volume of streaming audio with Alexa responses. Volume is naturally lowered when she responds to a query, but sometimes the bar seemed to get stuck and kept the music at the lower volume.

She's not set up for Spotify commands, either, though you can control Spotify from both the SmartThings app and Spotify Connect directly. Samsung says Alexa Spotify control is coming, again via firmware, but gave no indication of when. Overall, the Q800T's Alexa integration just doesn't seem ready for primetime.

Bluetooth streaming sounds heavily compressed

My first audition of the Q800T—streaming music via Bluetooth—sounded significantly compressed, especially for treble instruments like cymbals. At first I thought it was simply overcooked digital processing, but switching to Spotify Connect (via WiFi) seemed to quell the issue. As a Spotify Connect user, Bluetooth streaming isn't a huge concern, but I've heard it much better implemented. Further, Apple Music users may want to take note, as there’s no Apple Music or AirPlay support.

Should you buy it?

Yes, but with some caveats

While 2020 has been short on mid-tier and premium soundbars compared to ""normal"" times, the HW-Q800T's sound performance is among the best we've heard all year. It offers all the major features we expect for a soundbar in its class and, on semi-permanent sale at least, its price is generally in line with the competition. It's also pretty easy to use and doesn't take up much space on the mantle (for a Dolby Atmos bar anyway).

That said, Samsung's HW-Q70T soundbar offers nearly identical specs with two standout exceptions: there's no built-in microphones for Alexa, and it offers a smaller subwoofer. Given the fact that it can still support Alexa commands with the addition of an Echo speaker at $50, it's definitely a way to cut down the price significantly (especially given those Alexa bugs). Bass lovers will miss the heftier sub, but those with smaller living quarters may welcome the swap.

Those who want better Dolby Atmos immersion—particularly when it comes to overhead and surround effects—may want to opt for the Sonos Arc instead. The Arc is bigger, doesn't include a subwoofer, and doesn't come with a spare HDMI input, meaning you'll need a newer TV with Dolby Digital Plus to source Atmos directly. However, it offers warmer, more natural performance, simpler ways to build out a surround system (like adding the Symfonisk wireless speakers), and is backed by high-powered software. At the time of publication, Vizio's 46-inch 5.1.4 soundbar (with separate surrounds) also rings in at similar pricing and offers much better surround immersion.

In the end, whether the HW-Q800T is right for you may depend on your love for overhead effects, bass, and Alexa herself. That said, at its sale price, the Q800T is a stalwart new competitor that should fit quite nicely into most living rooms.

I say that as someone who used to religiously buy sports games starting way back in the NES days so my brother and I can play them to death. By the time the rivalry between EA Sports and Visual Concepts came about, there were times when we would actually buy their competing games during the same year. That’s how much we both enjoyed playing sports games.

Somewhere along the way, though, we just stopped.

Looking back, it’s really no surprise why my love affair with sports games ended with the whimper of an errant airball. One reason was that I started noticing that there really wasn’t much of a change between many of the brand new games and the titles they were replacing. I thought maybe it would be better to skip the next couple of games, at least until they kill the servers for the game I had. In other cases, I found myself just completely turned off by the blatant use of in-game microtransactions. Regardless of the reasons, I just stopped.

All that being said, there have been a couple of exceptions in recent years when it came to my sports game apathy. One of those would be EA’s annual escapade on ice, the NHL video game series.

Presentation and visuals

When it comes to presentation, NHL 21 makes a good first impression. The introductory movie featuring hockey superstar Alexander Ovechkin narrating his own rise from a promising hockey phenom to finally winning the Stanley Cup was a masterful stroke of editing that pumped me up for what was to come — and I’m not even a Washington Capitals fan. (Go, San Jose Sharks!)

Once the glow of the opening intro fades, however, I couldn’t help but notice that the game itself is starting to look a bit dated, especially when compared to the NBA 2K series. From the player models to the visuals on the ice, the game doesn’t really look like that big of a jump from, say, NHL 18. It’s not a big deal for the most part because you’re typically playing with the camera zoomed out. When the game gets up close, however, the aging visuals become apparent, at least on the PlayStation 4 version that I was playing on my 80-plus-inch television.

Onscreen graphics for team logos, goals and player mugs, on the other hand, have a modern, kinetic feel to them. This is especially apparent when compared to the NBC branding that was used a couple years ago, which had a more old-school feel. This part of the presentation is pretty subjective and it all boils down to whether you’re a purist or prefer today’s style of sports TV presentation. You’ve also got the announcing duo of radio guy James Cybulski and former player Ray Ferraro, who do a solid job overall with the play-by-play.

While the game could look better, it’s also important to note that looks aren’t the most important thing for games such as this. Gameplay is king after all, and that’s where NHL 21’s worth will be ultimately measured. At the same time, paying attention to the little things also shows the amount of care that is being put into a game. As far as visuals go, though, NHL 21 might appear like it’s aged but it also looks good enough.

Be A Pro gets fleshed out, plus a new HUT Rush

If there’s one thing that the folks behind NHL 21 really spent a lot of time on, it definitely would be the game’s Be A Pro, or BAP, mode. This year’s iteration of BAP really fleshes out the personal story of your created player, including his journey from being a new, inexperienced player to an ice-cold assassin on the rink.

Although you can jump straight into the NHL, one of the more intriguing prospects — no pun intended — is starting your career in Europe and building your reputation and brand recognition from there. It certainly adds a nice twist to the story, especially with the role-playing elements that try to simulate what life is like as a new player.

Anchoring NHL 21’s Be A Pro experience are three metrics that impact player development and ultimately factor into your likability rating. One is the teammate metric, which impacts your relationship with your fellow players. Raise this and you can see benefits on the ice, like receiving more passes from teammates during games, for example. Management, meanwhile, measures your relationship with the team’s leadership or brain trust. Brand, meanwhile, influences your image as well as things like endorsements. Doing well with these parameters will reward you with perks that you can use to improve your player, making them essential in your journey to superstardom.

To raise your parameters for all three, you will need to take advantage of the new conversation system. It works almost like a Telltale-style chat where the choices you make end up having consequences. Note that just because one choice helps raise one metric doesn’t mean it will raise the others. In fact, a good choice for one metric might actually lower your rating in another metric. Painting the town red with your teammates or making overconfident proclamations filled with bravado might boost your teammate or brand, for example. As far as the folks who oversee the team, however, well, let’s just say that management will remember that. There will also be segments where your coach will issue you a challenge or perhaps set an in-game goal for you to fulfill. You can choose to respond to this in a safe way, which garners a smaller reward but also minimizes the risk if you fail. Otherwise, you can pick a riskier choice, which heightens the rewards of success but also leads to worse consequences should you choke. In that sense, Be A Pro adds a risk-reward element to the mix to stir the pot and keep things interesting.

While the likability mechanics of the game are a nice addition, however, they also have some obvious hiccups. There will be times, for example, when the feedback you get from your coach after you’re given a challenge ends up not matching your performance on the ice. This gets annoying when you do well but still get criticized for supposedly not performing up to standards, causing your likability to drop. Basically, you can do great but if the rest of your team sucks, you can still get punished for it. This is especially an issue when you play as a goalie and have to rely more on your AI teammates not being brain dead dunces on skates. It’s one of the downsides to what’s arguably the standout mode of NHL 21. There’s just a disconnect between your performance and your evaluation sometimes, which can get frustrating when it occurs.

Besides BAP, the other shiny feature of NHL 21 is the new HUT Rush mode.

This can almost be described as a more arcade-style hockey experience, complete with variable rules and goals. Forget about substance, this mode is all about style — literally. Anchoring HUT rush is its unique scoring system, which uses a style-based metric that awards multipliers and higher points when you score with certain shots. You can choose to set the parameters for victory as well as player counts, like 3 vs. 3 or 5 vs. 5.

If you like to play something different than the traditional hockey game, HUT Rush can provide a nice change of pace.

Gameplay is smoother but roster sharing still MIA

While the more fleshed out Be A Pro mode is great for people who love it, other aspects of NHL 21 didn’t quite get the same amount of attention.

Franchise mode, for example, got some quality-of-life additions such as improved tracking for statistics plus a new trade deadline experience that provides a more heightened sense of urgency. All in all, however, it’s pretty much the same experience from last year. There’s still no connected franchise mode, for example, and scouting can still be cumbersome at times and not as intuitive as it could be.

Roster sharing, which is one of the most requested features from the community, also continues to be a glaring omission. Yes, you can download the official roster updates or create new players and custom rosters. However, there’s still nothing like being able to tap into an entire community’s work for a wide variety of rosters that would take you forever to replicate yourself.

On the plus side, gameplay for NHL 21 has gotten even better. Movement on the ice feels especially good right off the bat and I didn’t feel like I needed to make any major adjustments to the slider settings in order to enjoy it. I didn’t struggle as much with getting my player to move how I wanted on the rink. The only thing I’d like to see is improved mobility when handling the puck away from your body.

One result of the improved movement, by the way, is a quicker pace of play. Granted that might make the game feel more arcade-like — something that might not float well for folks who prefer a more sim-like experience. Personally, though, the quicker pace felt great to me overall. The improved feel also extends to the goalie, which makes manually controlling your keeper a better experience than before. Goalie control just feels more responsive, which is good news for folks who like to play as net defenders.

NHL 21 also adds some new tricks, including the Michigan move for sneaky behind-the-net scoring. You can also do a self-pass by banking or bouncing the puck from the net back to yourself. Then there’s the Kuch deke, which you had to manually finagle with in past games but is now officially incorporated in NHL 21’s moveset.

One issue in terms of gameplay is that the AI can still be inconsistent at times. This can be especially noticeable during BAP mode, when you’re more at the mercy of AI teammates. It just can be maddening when AI mistakes either cost you a scoring opportunity or results in a goal against your team. The game also has occasional bugs like missing feet, corrupted roster files or getting stuck in the dressing room.

Final thoughts

Despite not being as big a fan of sports games like I used to be, EA’s NHL series is the one I still have a soft spot for among the ongoing crop of sports titles. I just like its balance of fun gameplay and how it doesn’t shamelessly abuse microtransactions like other more popular sports games out there. For NHL 21, the series brings in a more fleshed out Be A Pro mode as well as more intuitive movement on the ice. The minimal improvements to franchise mode, however, combined with the lack of key fan-requested features such as shared rosters make NHL 21 feel incomplete. It’s still one of the better, more consumer-friendly sports games out there. At the same time, I also feel that it could still be much better.

Here's what to know about it","The video game ""Among Us"" captured the spotlight Tuesday night after House Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar joined Twitch to play along with top streamers as part of a broader effort to encourage Americans to vote in the upcoming election.

The stream drew more than 435,000 viewers, making it one of the most popular streams ever on Twitch.

Although the game launched more than two years, it only recently surged in popularity this year after several YouTubers and streamers started to profile the game through their channels.

So, what is ""Among Us"" all about? Here's what you should know about the video game.

How does 'Among Us' work?

It's a multiplayer game where between four and 10 people play as part of a spaceship crew working together to keep their vessel running as they return home.

Players will get a series of tasks such as managing the engines or diverting power to parts of the ship, represented in a series of mini-challenges.

Here's the twist: One player is an alien Impostor. That player can sabotage efforts to fix the ship and kill crewmembers. Other players can signal an alarm when a dead crewmember is found, and call emergency meetings to uncover the traitor.

It's very collaborative, especially during emergency meetings when you try to hash out who is playing as Impostor. For the crew, the goal is to either get your ship home or eject the Impostor, while the rogue alien traitor must sabotage the ship to claim victory.

COVID-19 impact:Amazon will allow corporate employees to work from home through June 2021

Netflix earnings:Streaming giant reports a summer slump in subscriber growth

Where can I play this?

It's available on PC, as well as Apple iOS and Google Android devices.

How popular is the game?

It's the top free game on Apple's App Store and Google Play. According to PC gaming platform Steam's top games list – based on current player count – ""Among Us"" is fourth.

As The New York Times reports, the game actually launched in 2018 but surged in popularity this year after several YouTube stars and influencers started highlighting the game.

Why is this stream featuring 'Among Us' a big deal?

Politicians have shown interest in the video game space as a new opportunity to reach voters. Last month, the campaign for presidential candidate Joe Biden and vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris launched online merchandise for the Nintendo Switch game ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons.""

Meanwhile, one of the biggest games out there, ""Fortnite,"" has served as a hub for big events including a concert from Travis Scott and an interview with J.J. Abrams, director of ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" who shared exclusive clips tied to the movie. In April, The Washington Post reported on how ""Fortnite"" could pave way for the next version of the Internet.

Now, Apple is taking that literally.

At 1 p.m. EST Tuesday on its website, Apple is expected to show off new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops powered by the same processing chip the company uses in its iPhone and newer iPads, which Apple calls the ""A14 Bionic."" It will be the company's third major product event of the fall following debuts of new iPads and iPhones.

You might be asking, will the computer be slower with an iPhone chip powering it? Could a new Mac still process heavy-duty video and photo processing applications like it did with the previous chip, made by computer powerhouse Intel?

""Of course,"" says Tim Bajarin, a longtime analyst who has covered Apple since the 1980s, from his perch as president of Creative Strategies. ""If it wasn't faster, Apple wouldn't be doing it.""

The pandemic boosted Apple:Company sold more Macs this summer than ever before

More iPhone 12s? Get ready for iPhone 12 Pro Max, plus the Xbox, PS5 and HomePod Mini

On Apple's website, the company boasts that the newly released iPad Air, with the A14 chip, ""is faster than most PC laptops."" And for the iPhone, the chip has ""forty percent more transistors rev up speeds while increasing efficiency for great battery life.""

Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, says the processors will be ""optimized for the unique heavy-duty power characteristics of the company's laptops,"" and it will take roughly two years to be embedded across the entire Mac product line.

Apple computers start at $999 for the basic MacBook Air, $1,299 for the 13-inch MacBook, or $2,399 for the 16-inch MacBook. The more powerful iMac computers start at $1,099 for the 21-inch version, vs. $5,000 for the iMac Pro and $5,999 for the Mac Pro computer.

By not paying Intel a license fee for every computer it sells, Bajarin says Apple could start seeing lower prices for Macs, by as much as possibly $50-$100.

Despite offering computers at higher prices than rivals, Apple has found itself on a roll during COVID-19 times, recently announcing a record quarter with higher sales for the iPad and Mac computers.

""Apple continues to see a tidal wave of demand for its iPad and Macs as more consumers expect to see the WFH trend continue for the foreseeable future adding further importance to this week's virtual event,"" said Ives.

In the earnings announcement, Apple said it sold more Macs than ever before in the July/August/September quarter, a beneficiary of the work and learning from home shift fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.

Apple said it sold $9 billion worth of Macs, up from $6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The sales for the iPad also jumped, with revenues of $6.8 billion, vs. $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Sales of the flagship iPhone took a hit in the quarter, but that's because the new iPhones, traditionally released in September, were delayed due to manufacturing issues. The new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, released Oct. 23, were not included in the earnings report.

Two more new iPhones, the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, will be released Friday.

Joe Biden's win of the presidency was called by AP and the major news organizations, including USA TODAY Saturday.

In these videos, a Trump supporter removes a pro-Trump flag from their bedroom or living room wall, often with a conciliatory message. The videos are set to a downtempo remix of Disclosure and Sam Smith's ""Latch.""

""Good luck Biden,"" reads the original video, posted by user chumbucket7877 Friday. ""Congratulations to all of his supporters. I wish nothing but good health and love for him You are my president and I will respect you for however long you are in office for.""

The video now has at least dozens of other Trump supporters who followed suit, including one who acknowledged that the race has still not been called.

""I know it's still not over,"" a TikTok user named Ethan Meehan, who posted a TikTok of himself removing a Trump flag from his room before the race was called, wrote in the video's caption.

Business Insider and the BBC's Marianna Brady were the first to share these videos outside of the platform.

On the platform, the response was decidedly mixed. One user praised the response, calling their decision to respect Biden's likely win respectful.

""This is a real patriot,"" one user, Casey Duncan, wrote approvingly.

More:Marshall Islands could be lost to climate change as early as 2080, new study finds

Some lampooned the video, calling it ""dramatic"" and ""a mess.""

Other Trump supporters also used the sound to further condemn Biden and his supporters. ""I hope Biden supporters are happy now,"" one user said.

That was in 2009. And he's been at it ever since.

Along the way, he met his wife, started a family, and (thanks to Patreon, YouTube and Facebook) garnered a ""six figure"" salary. All by making nearly 300 videos of his travels, on the SV Delos channel, from the sea.

Trautman describes Delos as a place for ""adventure seeking souls"" to ""follow the wind and sun to explore this amazing planet."" And during a pandemic, being in isolation on a boat with his wife and young daughter means little worries about catching the coronavirus.

What makes someone become a nomad?

""I lived on the east side of Seattle and my commute was about 45 minutes each way to work every day,"" Trautman, 44, recalled. ""I came to realize that my favorite part of the day was the bus ride, because that's when I had no emails, no meetings, nobody trying to get me to do anything. So I decided to quit, go out and explore the world by sailboat, because that's my passion, and thought maybe it would work out.""

With over 600,000 subscribers to his weekly sailing videos on YouTube, 100,000 likes on his Facebook page, and 2,168 people who pay to support Trautman on his Patreon site, he may be onto something.

Is the business lunch dead?:In the days of COVID-19, lunch breaks can mean biking, hiking meetings

On the road:This couple was fed up with expensive rent, so they turned an old school bus into a home

On Patreon, people pay from $5 to $25 weekly to see his latest videos and get discounts on Delos merchandise. Many of his videos on YouTube, which feature trips to various islands, local bars, the big city (he and his family recently stopped in New York), scuba dives and the basic gist of raising a family have attracted upward of 5 million views.

USA TODAY spoke to Trautman via Skype, from his Delos boat (named after a Greek island) docked near Baltimore. If you're wondering how he was able to connect, electrical power for the computer and other devices comes from a solar and wind generator, and internet is via a satellite company named Viasat that has lent him the system to test out.

""If you consider that we do it all from a sailboat quite often in the middle of nowhere just adds another level of complexity to the whole thing,"" he said. To be out in the seas, between some remote islands, ""and be able to stream Netflix and watch 'Stranger Things' or chat with the family over Facebook is just amazing.""

Starting a travel channel

The channel started as a lark, a way for Trautman to show his parents his adventures, but then it began reaping views. He didn't plan on the channel becoming a money-making operation and, in fact, he was living on savings and credit cards for the first three years.

Running a boat is anything but cheap. So now that it's sustaining itself, inquiring minds want to know how it all works. Most channels look to YouTube, because it rewards creators with a cut of the ad revenues, but he says YouTube income isn't that lucrative. It's Patreon that provides the lion's share of the income. ""We depend upon donations from people who watch the videos,"" Trautman said. ""Where people can directly support us.""

Patreon is Trautman's biggest income generator, followed by merchandise sales, and then YouTube.

His tips for those who want to ditch the rat race and make a living this way: Do it because you're passionate about the subject, not that you want to make a business out of it, otherwise you'll burn out.

And once you get going, be consistent with video uploads and have a good story.

Trautman posted videos occasionally, switched to bi-monthly, and then weekly, and each time saw an increase in viewership when he became consistent.

The work behind the channel

It's not easy. Producing videos, and editing them can take as much as 40 hours a week, all while also running the boat. He shoots on GoPro and DJI Action cameras for footage of the boat, and when there's dialogue, he switches to the Panasonic GH5.

What about food? Inside the boat is a big freezer, which they stock up every few weeks when they dock, and then, of course, there's free stuff roaming the ocean as well. ""I've eaten so much fish over the years,"" he said. ""I don't want to sound jaded, but sometimes I wish I could catch a cheeseburger instead.""

The birth of his daughter Sierra (now 14 months old) was documented, and now many episodes feature him and his wife, Karin, raising her on the boat. What about when she gets older? Will she go to school or be home-schooled on the boat? He doesn't know yet.

""For right now, we're going to continue sailing as a family and exploring the world because we love it, and take it as it comes,"" Trautman said. ""We try not to let plans ruin our spontaneous adventure.""

At this stage, Trautman shows no signs of wanting to return to dry land.

""I love the freedom,"" of being on the sea, he said. ""I love that we can go anywhere, of course, based on the weather."" Or a pandemic.

""COVID has made it so tough,"" he said. ""It (has) completely changed our plans."" Trautman's initial idea was to go and explore Canada, but the border is now closed, so he had to turn around. ""Now I'm dreaming of heading to Central America, if we can.""

He would love to visit Costa Rica and Belize, instead. But as of this interview, he wasn't sure where he would land. ""We're vagabonds of the sea. We're never sure where we're going tomorrow.""

196,2020-11-07 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/07/yes-iphone-and-games-biggest-holiday-sellers-routers-tvs-too/6174727002/,What's hot for tech holiday? 'Practical' gifts like routers and computer monitors,"Are you feeling practical?

We're just a few weeks away from Black Friday and intense holiday shopping time during an era of COVID-19. Do you know what you'll be purchasing?

Stephen Baker, a longtime analyst with the NPD Group, which tracks sales of consumer products, says to expect a holiday filled with non-sexy products like computer monitors, external mice and keyboards and routers. Yes, routers.

""You're not going to give a spa certificate or holiday tickets to Bermuda,"" said Baker. ""Instead, we're seeing more tangible gifts like a router. Give your family the gift of better internet connectivity.""

This year, the pandemic has put a twist on consumer electronic sales. Shoppers have already pushed huge sales gains for products that make it easier to work and learn from home, Baker said.

Router sales: up 50%. Computer monitors: up 80%. Big-screen TVs: up 35%.

Baker sees that trend continuing for the holiday shopping season, where the next generation video consoles from Sony and Microsoft (PlayStation 5 and Xbox 5) are expected to be the hardest to get. New iPhones, while not generally gifts, will actually be the biggest sellers of the holiday, along with Apple AirPods and other headsets, per Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

What else is hot?

► TVs traditionally are the best sellers for the holiday, as consumers opt for the bargain prices. Baker said to expect many 65-inch sets for as low as $250, and even larger ones to be heavily discounted.

► Computer monitors. Baker said this is the fastest growing category in consumer electronics. ""Kids want a bigger screen when they're doing education at home, parents are adding second or third screens to their home setup for work. Screens are clearly much more important than they've been before."" (Laptops have been a big seller all year long and hard to get, but don't tend to be purchased for the holidays, Baker said.)

► Streaming sticks. With virtually every TV being a ""smart"" TV with built-in streaming now, you could expect for sales of the Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks to take a hit. But no, said Baker. They will continue to be among the most popular products. Sales are already up 40%, and for the past several years, Amazon traditionally lists the Fire TV streaming stick as one of its top sellers at holiday time. ""There are millions and millions of older TVs,"" said Baker. ""And maybe you got a smart TV, but don't like the interface, so you replace it with a Roku.""

What's not hot?

► Smart speakers. Amazon traditionally massively discounts the Echo speaker line during the holidays, but so far this year, Baker hasn't seen a ""huge jump"" in sales for these products during COVID times. That said, he expects Apple's HomePod Mini, it's first consumer priced smart speaker, at $99, to be a big seller, fueled by Apple's marketing muscle. All of Apple best-selling products, from iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches, have seen a boost from pandemic-era customers, the company has said.

► Smart home devices. These products have been heavily touted over the last few years, but getting smart locks and other automation products to work can take some skill. Baker says none of them are particularly strong sellers, except for the video doorbell category, which monitors what's going on outside your front door. Those products have seen a 30% lift this year, he said.

Meanwhile, the Black Friday of your memory, the one of massively discounted TVs that serve as ""doorbusters"" to bring in hundreds of people will be a thing of the past this year.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified “shopping at crowded stores just before, on or after Thanksgiving” on a list of higher-risk activities to avoid and in guidance issued ahead of the fall holidays also suggest more online shopping.

Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy Global Data, said the idea of any retailer driving crowds of people into their stores is a “non-starter.”

“No retailer can run the risk of overcrowding, and so all will be looking to balance the need to drive sales with the need to keep people safe,” Saunders said.

But have no fear, the lines and doorbusters will be back next year, Baker says.

""When people shop in store, they tend to shop more, and buy more expensive things,"" Baker said. ""So this is something they want to return. Next year, I would expect there to be some interesting things for you to buy the day after Thanksgiving.""

So start saving now.

The gig economy lives on, thanks to a closely watched California proposition. Uber, Lyft and other app-based ride-hailing and delivery services spent big to preserve their business model by keeping drivers from becoming employees eligible for benefits and job protections. And they won. The outcome was a defeat for labor unions that had pushed for a state law aimed directly at Uber and Lyft, mandating they provide drivers with protections like minimum wage, overtime, health insurance and reimbursement for expenses.

DJI introduced a cute, ultra-light sequel to the Mini drone, now titled Mini II, which brings higher resolution (4K) and a larger imaging chip to the same tiny, pocketable drone, and a slightly higher list price, $50 more than last year, at $449.

How does that work? How long will it take?,"On Friday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said the state would have a recount because of the slim vote margin. The margin is currently 0.2% with 99% of votes counted. The state had about 4,169 votes left to count, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system implementation manager. A recount could take until the end of the month, he noted.

Sterling said counties will hand-count a deck of ballots as a test, which will then be sent through high-speed scanners located at the central county elections office. If the tallies match and the election workers determine the scanner is working accurately, every single ballot will then be rescanned. According to AP's research, there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000. And of those, only three changed the outcome of the election. The initial margins in those races were all under 300 votes.

Rules for recounting

The laws governing recounts vary by state and a handful of states do not offer a recount process at all. Here are the rules in key states:

Arizona

An automatic recount is triggered in Arizona if the margin between candidates is less than or equal to 0.1% of the votes cast.

Neither candidates nor voters can directly request recounts in Arizona. Recounts can only be conducted by court order.

Georgia

Where paper ballots are used and it appears there is a discrepancy or error, the superintendent may order a recount, or any candidate or political party may petition for one.

A losing candidate may request a recount when results are within 0.5% of total votes cast for the office.

""The request must be made within two business days following certification of the results,"" according to the National Association of Secretaries of State.

The deadline for certifying results in Georgia is 14 days after the election, in this case Nov. 17.

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: Within two business days after county certification.

Who pays for a requested recount: State.

Deadline for completion: No set deadlines.

Michigan

A recount is automatically triggered in Michigan when the election is determined by a difference of 2,000 votes or less. A candidate can also ask for a recount if they have a ""reasonable chance of winning the election.""

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: Within 48 hours after the canvass.

Who pays for a requested recount: The requester.

Deadline for completion: No later than 30 days after either the last day to file counter petitions or the first day that recounts may begin.

Nevada

Nevada does not have an automatic trigger for a recount. A candidate at any election, or any registered voter of the appropriate political subdivision can request a recount.

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: Within three business days of canvass.

Who pays for a requested recount: The requester.

Deadline for completion: Within 10 days of the request.

North Carolina

A candidate can request a recount if the vote difference for the election is at 10,000 or 0.5% of the votes cast, whichever is smaller.

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: No later than on the second business day after the canvass.

Who pays for a requested recount: There is no mention in state law, but the general practice is that the state covers the cost of a requested recount.

Deadline for completion: No set deadline.

Pennsylvania

Automatic recount is triggered if the margin of victory is 0.5% of the vote or closer. Candidates cannot request a recount but can appeal the “order or decision of any county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the returns of any primary or election, or regarding any recount or recanvass thereof.”

In individual precincts or election districts, a recount can be requested if at least three voters make such a request in the court of common pleas.

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: Within five days of the election or within five days after the computational canvass if requested through the court.

Who pays for a requested recount: The requester.

Deadline for completion: Not specified. An automatic recount must be done no later than the first Tuesday after the third Wednesday following the election, or in this case by Nov. 24.

Wisconsin

If the race stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can force a recount. Before any decision could be made on a recount, the official results need to be finalized over the coming weeks.

Deadline to request non-mandatory recount: On the first business day following the canvass.

Who pays for a requested recount: If the margin is greater than 0.25%, the requester pays.

Deadline for completion: Within 13 days of the order for the recount.

""The simple fact is this election is far from over,"" Trump said in a statement Saturday.

If Trump refuses to deliver a public concession speech or make a congratulatory call to Biden, it would break with 124 years of American history. Experts say it would also undermine the election results and exacerbate the nation's political tensions, already laid bare by a bitter campaign and the extended, contested vote count.

“It will be truly harmful,” said William Howell, chair of the political science department at the University of Chicago.

“Concession speeches are a kind of affirmation about the legitimacy of elections,” he said. They’re about losing candidates recognizing the outcome and calling on their followers to do the same, “which is essential for the health of our democracy,"" he said.

Trump is not known for admitting fault or failure. And he is more prone to stoking divisions than healing them, as his public remarks and Twitter feed have demonstrated in recent days.

Earlier this week, as Biden inched closer to a win, Trump took the podium to make a series of baseless claims about election fraud and to accuse Democrats of trying to ""steal"" the election, while offering no evidence of illegal activity.

And on Saturday, his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said flatly: 'He's not going to concede."" And Trump's campaign touted plans to challenge the election results in the courts.

Some believe that Trump will come around and make a concession speech – if only to preserve his own political standing.

Trump would hardly be the first losing candidate to question the election results, said Scott Farris, the author of ""Almost President: The Men Who Lost the Race but Changed the Nation.""

""Richard Nixon, for example, was sure he'd been cheated in 1960 against John Kennedy because of shenanigans in Texas and Illinois,"" Farris said. ""But ... he realized that if he didn't come across as a good loser, his future in politics was probably over.""

Trump will come to a similar conclusion, Farris added. He may also realize that if he is a sore loser, it will reflect badly on his children who seem to have their own political ambitions, he added.

“As he looks ahead, I think it'll come to him that ‘I need to say something and be fairly a good sport about this’,” Farris said.

Election challenges: Georgia, Michigan judges toss Trump suits over ballots as lawsuits are filed in Nevada and Pennsylvania

Since 1896, every losing presidential candidate in American history has delivered a concession message, whether by telegram to the victor or via a nationally televised address to the nation.

Some have been humble and gracious, others not so much.

“A few have been petulant,” Farris said, mentioning Barry Goldwater’s 1964 concession to Lyndon Johnson and George McGovern’s 1972 concession to Richard Nixon. “Both were kind of not necessarily the most gracious of losers,” he said, adding that they had personal animosity toward the men who defeated them.

Cindy McCain: A Republican’s reasons for voting Biden

Among the most memorable: Sen. John McCain's concession to Barack Obama in 2008.

""The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama,"" McCain began in remarks outside his election night headquarters in Phoenix. The crowd interrupted his speech with a loud chorus of boos, but McCain held up his hands to quiet them.

""Please,"" he said, before continuing to say that he'd congratulated Obama for ""being elected the next president of the country that we both love."" McCain noted the historic significance of Obama's election as the country's first Black president, and he promised to do ""all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.""

""I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president,"" the late Arizona senator said.

Howell said concession speeches usually touch on key themes, including patriotism and love of country over party.

""What’s crucial is grace and a recognition of facts,"" he said. Candidates almost always make a reference to the well-fought campaign battle, then give a nod to the winner's legitimacy, Howell said.

The last incumbent president to lose a reelection bid was George H.W. Bush. Like others, he used his concession speech to urge Americans to move past the election and unite behind his opponent Bill Clinton.

""We respect the majesty of the democratic system,"" Bush said. ""... America must always come first, so we will get behind this new president and wish him well.”

In the traditional private note he left for Clinton, Bush was even more personal and direct: ""Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you.""

In her 2016 concession speech, Hillary Clinton talked about how painful the election loss was but she similarly urged her supporters to give Trump a chance.

""I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too,"" Clinton said. But, she continued, ""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.

""Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it,"" she added.

In the hotly contested 2000 election, former Vice President Al Gore famously called George W. Bush to concede the day after the election, but then quickly called back to retract it as the vote count in the all-important state of Florida see-sawed between the two men.

Gore and Bush then each dug in for a 36-day political stalemate that ended when a U.S. Supreme Court decision halted a recount in Florida with Bush ahead by 537 votes. That made Bush the winner.

""Just moments ago I spoke with George W. Bush and congratulated him on becoming the 43rd president of the United States. And I promised him that I wouldn't call him back this time,"" Gore said on Dec. 13 in his concession speech.

""Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it,"" Gore said of the high court's 5-4 ruling. "" ... And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.""

Responding to reports that Trump would not concede, Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said: “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

Howell said he didn't want to speculate about whether Trump will eventually give a concession speech.

""But I think what we can say is that none of the early gestures that have come from him in the last few days suggest grace, admission, or fidelity to the facts,"" he said.

Farris agreed it would a horrible blow to democracy if Trump refuses to concede and publicly recognize Biden's win. But if Trump is reluctant, it's no wonder, said Ferris, who had to deliver his own concession speech after losing a congressional race in Wyoming in 1998.

""America doesn't like losers,"" Farris said. And ""one of the problems that we have with losing presidential candidates is that we treat them as pariahs ... so they've struggled to find their place in American history.""

But a concession speech might appeal to Trump's transactional instincts, in that it could buy him some goodwill, he argued.

""I expect it to be one of the less gracious concession speeches we've ever heard,"" Farris said. ""I certainly don't expect him to say, 'Well, that's the way the breaks go ... It was a fair fight and c'est la vie'.""

Attempting to discredit election results in a battleground state, a number of social media posts shared this week make the claim that thousands of voters in Michigan had cast a ballot under the names of deceased people.

""Here is a list of 14+ thousand dead people who voted in Wayne County (Detroit),"" reads a Facebook post from The Liberalists that directs to an invalid link. The page asks users to ""verify it"" by doing a search of the names on the Michigan Voter Information Center.

In a message to USA TODAY, The Liberalists said the link was to a database list of dead people you could put in yourself, but that the link was removed by Facebook.

Fact or fiction, we'll tell you:We're fact checking the news and sending it to your inbox. Sign up to get that here.

The claim caused some speculation and controversy in the comment section. Some users wrote that the list contains registered voters, but it doesn't mean they actually voted.

Another user wrote, ""every american should be checking their dead relatives.""

Many voters on list are old, but still alive

The link that the user claimed to be evidence is no longer available. The site reads that it has been ""expired, removed by its creator, or removed by one of the Pastebin staff.""

However, while the link was still live, PolitiFact found that the voters listed were over the age of 100 but several were not marked in Michigan's voter information center and not all were Wayne County residents.

One of the alleged dead voters listed, Imo Oliver, of Ypsilanti, is still alive, according to PolitiFact. She said she suffered from memory loss but that her son helped her to vote in the 2020 election.

Fact check:False claim that deceased Michigan man voted in 2020

Fact check: Lawsuit alleging errors in Detroit voter rolls was in 2019 and was settled

The Michigan Secretary of State's office states on its fact-check page that ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if a voter cast an absentee ballot and then died prior to Election Day.

""On rare occasions, a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead,"" the site reads. ""This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file.""

For example, a voter born in 1990 can be accidentally recorded as being born in 1890, but in this type of scenario, no one ineligible actually voted and there is ""no impact on the outcome of the election,"" according to the site.

This was the case in an example cited in a viral video on Twitter. Amanda Kirkpatrick, the clerk in Jackson County, Michigan, told The New York Times that a resident used in one of the videos was actually an eligible voter who had cast her ballot but had the incorrect date of the birth.

Michigan’s Secretary of State office debunked as ""misinformation"" the claim that a 118-year-old man named William Bradley had cast an absentee ballot, USA TODAY reported.

Fact check: Georgia ballot curing is not election fraud

Studies and experts say there is generally no evidence of ballots cast in the names of dead voters

USA TODAY has previously fact-checked the claim that dead people are casting ballots and found no evidence to support this.

Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University and author of ""The Myth of Voter Fraud,"" previously told USA TODAY that because it takes election officials some time to sort things out, there could be a short period of time that a voter registration list contains names of people who have died.

Minnite said referencing voter registration lists to support the claim that dead people can vote is misleading because the lists are regularly updated.

Studies also show that while dead voters may still receive ballots, the ballots may be marked as ""deceased"" to update voter lists and a voter's signature is required to match on the ballot in order for it to qualify. While these cases are possible, experts say they are rare.

Fact check: Votes in Virginia accidentally tallied for Biden, error quickly fixed

Our rating: False

The claim that 14,000 dead people in Wayne County, Michigan, voted in the 2020 election is FALSE, based on our research. The list has been investigated and it was found that some individuals on the list were either still alive, or not living in Michigan. Other examples cited were the result of date of birth errors. Ballots cast by dead people in Michigan are rejected and there is no evidence of fraud.

201,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/09/younger-more-diverse-voters-could-reshape-south-politics/6220697002/,"Younger, more diverse voters could reshape the South and turn Georgia, NC 'purple'","NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Election Day ushered in a new era as a younger, more diverse coalition of voters came together with an emphatic message: The South is changing.

The nature of that change varies depending on where you look.

Georgia has become a definitive new battleground, driven by record-breakingmobilization and increasing diversity. President-elect Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, holds a slim lead in the state. It is tight enough to trigger a recount, but the margin is still something that would have seemed inconceivable a few years ago.

Now Democrats are pinning their long-shot hopes of flipping control of the U.S. Senate to two competitive Georgia runoffs expected in January, a surprising development in a region stacked with red states.

Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor emeritus of political science at Vanderbilt University, said signs of an impending swing statein the South have been bubbling for years.

A strong base of support among Black voters in Atlanta and other Georgia cities grew to include a surge in the suburbs as more young and racially diverse residents flocked to the state for jobs. Politician Stacey Abrams' efforts to boost voter registration and turnout through her nonprofit Fair Fight capitalized on the opportunity for Democrats.

The evolution is “a story of American politics,"" Oppenheimer said.

“We’ve gotten so used to thinking everything will remain the same,"" he said. “The South has been less homogeneous than people think it is for a longer period of time.”

U.S. Census data show subtle shifts that took place over decades.

Georgia’s population grew by more than 2 million people from 2000 to 2019. The state saw diversity increase over that time. White residents made up 65.1% of the Georgia population in 2000, compared with 60.2% in 2019. At the same time, Black residents grew from 28.7% of the Georgia population to 32.6%.

Learotha Williams, a historian and Tennessee State University professor, said Abrams' upstart run for Georgia governor in 2018 galvanized growing but marginalized populations. Her work to register new voters might have made the difference in 2020, he said.

“That was the spark – her doing things a different way,” Williams said. “This thing that we’re witnessing now really blows my mind, but it’s a testament to a lot of work.”

Other Southern states offer opportunities, challenges for Democrats

Democrats hope Georgia is a bellwether, along with Virginia, showing a new region of opportunity for the party. There are indications other Southern states might be trending in a similar direction, albeit at a slower pace.

North Carolina, which is tipping for Republican President Donald Trump by a narrow margin, could slide to the left in coming election cycles as its urban areas expand, pulling in younger and more diverse residents from other parts of the country.

“These are big growth states with burgeoning economies,"" said David Darmofal, a political science professor at the University of South Carolina. “That’s helping to turn these states purple.""

Although South Carolina is firmly entrenched for Republicans now, political scientists say the state is beginning to mirror Georgia's shift with a large mobilizedBlack population and a growing auto industry bringing in higher-paying union jobs.

Kent Syler, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University and former Democratic political operative, said Georgia was an eye-opening signal of possibilities for his party.

“It was certainly more than pundits trying to create more swing states,"" Syler said. “You can see the votes.""

Other parts of the South show change cuts both ways.

While some in the South shift blue, Tennessee stays deep red

Nashville has lurched to the left in recent years and flipped a state Senate seat to the left on Tuesday. The 10 least conservative counties in Tennessee are in line with trends elsewhere in the South – they are clustered around cities, have higher percentages of people of color and have populations on the rise.

But Democratic growth in the state capital is countered by conservative strongholds in other areas.

At the state level, Tennessee is red as ever. Trump handily carried the state with 61% of the vote, the same share he received in 2016.

A passionate base of conservative support has expanded in rural and mostly white parts of the Volunteer State since 2008. Statewide leaders Gov. Bill Lee, Sen. Marsha Blackburn and incoming senator Bill Hagerty are all to the right of their predecessors.

Tennessee is more homogenous than some of its neighbors, with a larger population of rural white voters who offset urban growth. The same can be said of Arkansas and Alabama, which have largely become more conservative over time.

Political scientists predict realignment of resources

As parts of the South and the Sunbelt show more political malleability, segments of the Midwest are drifting further toward the right.

“This may be the last election in which we see Democrats doing significant advertising in Ohio or Iowa,” Darmofal said.

Darmofal predicted Democrats would shift those resources south to reflect the new realities of the map.

Syler said he will be watching Georgia to see how its blue tilt plays out in the upcoming Senate runoffs. The state's heightened national profile could attract more money, organizing and high-profile candidates to the region.

“Success breeds success,” Syler said. “It’s still something of an uphill fight, but it's obviously one that with the right get-out-the-vote effort could surprise people.""

But Syler cautioned that the strength of the conservative rural vote previews a daunting challenge for Democrats.

It is unclear how the outcome of the presidential election might affect the Republican and Democratic coalitions as they adjust to a new direction in Washington.

“The whole political map and strategy are very complicated now for both parties,” Syler said. “It’s a total wide-open ballgame.”

And with that news in hand comes a pair of furry friends: dogs are coming back to the White House.

President-elect Joe Biden will be ushering in two new first dogs when he makes his move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. The White House (and America) has been without presidential dogs since 2016 when President Donald Trump became the first president without a dog in decades.

German shepherds Major and Champ will be accompanying the Biden family to their new residence. The Biden grandchildren gave 12-year-old Champ, who joined the family in 2008, the name Biden Sr. often used as an endearment.

The dogs are even social media official, joining Twitter and Instagram under the moniker First Family Dogs. Multiple photos and videos of the adorable pups solo and with their presidential parents popped up on the Instagram account within its first 24 hours.

The Bidens adopted Major two years ago.

Major is from a litter of six other German shepherd puppies, who were given ""life-saving medical care"" after exposure to ""something toxic in their home,"" a Delaware Humane Association news release said at the time of adoption in 2018.

Major fostered with the Bidens before being adopted to join his pup-brother, Champ.

""We are so happy to welcome Major to the Biden family, and we are grateful to the Delaware Humane Association for their work in finding forever homes for Major and countless other animals,"" Biden told CNN in 2018. (Biden has owned at least three other German Shepherds and had a Great Dane named Governor.)

This isn't the first time the White House has had two dogs under its roof. Most recently, Barack Obama had two first dogs under his administration: Bo and Sunny, Portuguese water dogs.

Bo, who was the family's first first dog, made headlines when the Obama family took him in. Sunny joined the Obama family four years later. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his beloved terrier Fala. President George H.W. Bush's English springer spaniel Millie was featured on ""The Simpsons.""

When asked about plans for a four-legged addition to the White House in 2017, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, said in a statement: ""The first family is still getting settled so there are no plans at this time.""

""In the modern-day presidency, almost all of them have had a pet,"" said Jennifer Pickens, a White House social expert who wrote ""Pets at the White House."" Still, she noted, ""all didn't necessarily have them at the beginning of the administration.""

Associated Press

LIMA, Peru — Peruvian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday night to remove President Martín Vizcarra from office, expressing anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and citing alleged but unproven corruption allegations.

The president announced he would not try to fight the ouster, while analysts called the action by legislators an overt and risky power grab in a country where Vizcarra is highly popular but Congress is not.

The ouster measure was supported by 105 legislators — far more than the 87 votes needed for the two-thirds majority required to remove Peru's president. Many said they were casting their vote for his removal in the name of dead loved ones.

“Because of his negligence and incapacity we’ve lost thousands of compatriots,” lawmaker Robinson Gupioc said during over five hours of debate.

US coronavirus map:Tracking the outbreak

Coming just weeks after Vizcarra easily survived another removal vote, Monday's action could spell a new chapter of uncertainty for the country, which has the world’s highest per capita COVID-19 mortality rate and is facing a deep recession.

Legislators brought the impeachment proceeding forward on allegations that Vizcarra received more than $630,000 in exchange for two construction projects while serving as governor of a small province in southern Peru in 2011-2014. The allegations are being investigated, but Vizcarra’s supporters have questioned their veracity, noting that they come from construction managers themselves accused of corruption. The accusers could get any potential jail time reduced in exchange for the information.

In a late-night address, Vizcarra said he would not challenge the removal vote, saying he opted to act with the best interests of the Peruvian people and the nation's democracy in mind.

“Today I am leaving the government palace,” Vizcara said. “Today I am going home.”

According to the chain succession, the head of the legislature will take his place. Lawmakers scheduled a ceremony to swear in the new leader on Tuesday.

The speed of the move against the president and lack of evidence led some political analysts to warn that Congress could be putting Peru’s democracy in jeopardy.

“To go after a president and destabilize the country’s democracy in the middle of this type of crisis for no serious reason is beyond reckless,” said Steve Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist who has extensively studied Peru.

In his defense, Vizcarra warned opposition lawmakers that a rash decision to remove him could bring grave consequences for the already distressed nation. He arrived at Congress wearing a mask with the image of a condor flying over the Andean mountains and said, “History and Peruvians will judge our decisions.”

In Peru, lawmakers can remove a president on the vaguely defined grounds of “moral incapacity.” Vizcarra told them that such a vote “would increase fears about the viability and institutions of Peru, and that would bring grave economic consequences.”

But in numerous speeches, lawmakers went beyond the corruption allegations in explaining why they wanted Vizcarra out. Many pointed to Peru's high virus numbers, deadly oxygen shortages and the misuse of rapid antibody tests to diagnose cases even though they can’t identify infection early during an illness. At least 34,879 people have died among 922,333 infected by the virus in Peru, a nation of 32 million people.

“This is something I can never forgive,” lawmaker Maria Cabrera said.

Vizcarra rose to the nation’s highest office in 2018 after then-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned amid allegations that he had failed to disclose payments from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to his private consulting firm.

Vizcarra had made defeating corruption his principal mission and is one of the nation’s most popular leaders in recent history.

But he has been unable to find friends in Congress, dismissing lawmakers last year in a brash move cheered by citizens as a victory against dishonest politicians. He has also pushed through initiatives to curb corruption by changing how judges are chosen and to bar politicians with crimes from running for office.

Political analyst Alonso Cárdenas said the repeated attempts to oust Vizcarra highlight the weaknesses of Peru’s political system, where no party has a majority and politicians are guided more by individual interests than ideology.

Vizcarra’s predecessor also faced multiple attempts to remove him from office.

“As incredible as it seems, in Peru it is easier to kick out a president than a mayor,” Cárdenas said. “For the political system in general and the credibility of the state this is very negative."""

At nearly 31 years, Rosie had well exceeded the median life expectancy of 19 years for a black rhino living in captivity, the zoo said in a release announcing her death.

Rosie was in rapidly declining health and was suffering from several geriatric issues like hypertension and arthritis, according to the release.

""The loss of any animal is hard, but Rosie's passing weighs especially heavy on our hearts today as she was special to many. I can't imagine anyone not experiencing an emotional connection with Rosie when they saw her up close,"" Tom Stalf, Columbus Zoo president and CEO, said in the prepared statement.

Though rhinos are known for being solitary creatures, Rosie loved to interact with humans and enjoyed snacking on apples. She was cooperative with her care staff when they would collect blood or brush her teeth, the release said.

Rosie was also known for her artistic skills as she painted with her prehensile upper lip, the zoo said.

Born at the San Francisco Zoo on Jan. 6, 1990, Rosie had lived at the Columbus Zoo since Nov. 12, 2009.

Almost 98% of the world's total black rhino population is found in four countries: South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Currently, there are estimated to be approximately 5,000 black rhinos remaining in their native range.

While Rosie did not produce any calves, the zoo said she contributed to important research for rhino reproduction.

Unless you've been completely off the grid for the past few days, you're sure to know that on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden pulled ahead of President Donald Trump with the necessary 270 Electoral College votes and is set to become the 46th president of the United States with California's own Sen. Kamala Harris as vice president. As a result, the past few days have seen their share of parties and protests.

Gatherings in L.A. lead to more COVID cases as state sees biggest jump in months

There were plenty of spontaneous demonstrations over the weekend after Biden and Harris were announced as the winners in this year’s presidential election, causing California public health officials to remind residents that large public gatherings are not COVID-friendly — especially since daily coronavirus case counts in the state have recently soared.

Data from Johns Hopkins University showed Monday that the United States now has more than 10 million confirmed COVID-19 cases. L.A. County, meanwhile, has had at least 2,000 new coronavirus infections every day since Thursday, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.

California is seeing the biggest jump in COVID-19 cases in months, which Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday was ""obviously sobering."" As a result, health officials in the Bay Area are urging people who travel outside the region to quarantine for two weeks upon return in order to slow spread the infection in the area, where the case numbers have been generally lower than those in other heavily populated areas in the state.

“Let us remember that no matter how we feel, we all have an obligation to protect each other from COVID-19,"" L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement. ""Gathering with people outside of your household, especially in settings where people are shouting, chanting or singing and not distancing, can easily lead to increased cases of COVID-19. This will slow down our recovery and can result in more illnesses and deaths.”

Biden, who is already working on a COVID-19 task force, which currently includes three physicians from San Francisco, has continued to implore people to wear masks, saying wearing a mask is not political.

Just what does having a vice president-elect from California mean for our state? Laurel Rosenhall, writing for Cal Matters, opines that the win for Harris could result in three major wins for the state: California could attract more attention from the federal government, the state’s progressive policies could become more dominant nationwide and more Californians could end up running the federal government.

Speaking of Harris, who made history as California's first African-American senator and on Saturday made history again by becoming the first African-American and Asian-American woman to be elected vice president: Just who should fill her U.S. Senate seat in 2021? Many are speculating that it will — or should — be another woman of color.

One person believed to be high on the list of replacements is Rep. Karen Bass, who has served California's 37th Congressional District for five terms and was vetted for the vice presidential role.

Gov. Gavin Newsom will make the appointment, and whoever holds the seat will be up for election in 2022.

Veterans ask Newsom to reopen vet posts

The California State Commanders Veterans Council (CSCVC), a statewide coalition of veterans organizations, are calling upon Newsom to reopen California’s veterans’ halls and posts, which have been closed since March because of what they say is a mistaken categorization during the coronavirus pandemic.

The CSCVC sent Newsom a letter last week saying that veterans' posts provide necessary services to veterans, such as processing claims for healthcare and disability benefits.

However, these important services have been denied to veterans, according to the organization, because several posts hold a restrictive, membership-only veterans’ liquor license and as a result have been unfairly placed in the same reopening limbo as bars.

“California’s veterans’ posts play a critical role in connecting our state’s veterans with the benefits and services they need,"" said Ed Grimsley, state commander of the American Legion's Department of California.

""They also aid homeless veterans, connect veterans dealing with depression and PTSD to counseling, and provide meals for disabled and homebound veterans,"" Grimsley said. ""The closure of our posts has had a direct and negative impact on the ability of veterans’ service officers to help our veterans.""

The CSCVC is asking that halls in all counties be allowed to reopen so long as they comply with the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and county health restrictions.

So far, there has been no response from Newsom.

Supreme Court's ACA decision could affect millions of Californians

On Tuesday, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments in California v. Texas, a case brought by the state of Texas and 18 Republican attorneys general, with backing from President Donald Trump, that could overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.

According to The Orange County Register, ""the case argues that Obamacare is unconstitutional because the law cannot stand without the tax penalty that accompanies the individual mandate, which is the requirement to have health coverage."" When the mandate’s tax penalty was eliminated as part of the 2017 tax bill, the Republican attorneys general say, both the mandate and the rest of the law were rendered unconstitutional.

The California Health Care Foundation says there are currently about 1.5 million Californians enrolled in health care plans made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which offers tax credits to help low-income households pay for coverage. In addition, there are 12.5 million Californians covered by Medi-Cal, with a recent expansion of the program adding an additional 3.7 million enrollees.

In addition to helping consumers with affordable health care, the ACA also includes consumer protections such as barring health insurers from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Since the ACA was enacted, the state's uninsured rate has fallen from 17% to 7.1%.

California has more to lose than any other state if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Affordable Care Act.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says Obamacare remains legal without the mandate. ""We feel pretty confident that, as in the past, when the justices look to the fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act, they’re going to find that it is constitutional,” he told California Healthline.

It's predicted that the court won't rule until spring 2021 at the earliest.

“The village was rocked by the sound of bursting crackers,” a local Indian TV reporter recounted in a video clip that showed a group of villagers in Thulasendrapuram, home to Harris’ grandfather, gathered in a semicircle around a small lighted firework.

“Sweets were also distributed to the public,” the reporter noted.

At the village temple, a priest performed a special prayer to celebrate Harris' win. Some residents put up posters featuring a big photo of Harris, while others wrote colorful, congratulatory wishes in front of their houses.

“Congratulations Kamala Harris, the pride of our village,'' one message read.

Some expressed hopes that Harris would visit Thulasendrapuram once she is sworn in, the local TV reporter said.

Meanwhile, Harris’ uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, who lives in New Delhi, said he plans to travel to Washington for Harris’ inauguration.

""I spoke to her day before yesterday. It was family chitchat,” he told the Times of India.

Balachandran said he wasn’t nervous about the outcome of the election. “I know she was going to win,” he told Reuters.

Harris made history as the first woman to be elected vice president, as well as the first African American and South Asian American. Harris’ mother is from India, and her father came to the U.S. from Jamaica.

Associated Press

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — More than a quarter million Danes went into lockdown Friday in a northern region of the country where a mutated variation of the coronavirus has infected minks being farmed for their fur, leading to an order to kill millions of the animals.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the move was meant to contain the virus, and it came two days after the government ordered the cull of all 15 million minks bred at Denmark's 1,139 mink farms.

The coronavirus evolves constantly and, to date, there is no evidence that any of the mutations pose an increased danger to people. But Danish authorities were not taking any chances.

""Instead of waiting for evidence, it is better to act quickly,"" said Tyra Grove Krause, head department at Statens Serum Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of the coronavirus in Denmark.

In seven northern Danish municipalities with some 280,000 residents sport and cultural activities have been suspended, public transportation has been stopped and regional borders have been closed. Only people with so-called ""critical functions"" such as police and health officials and different authorities are being permitted to cross municipal boundaries.

People in the region have been urged to to be tested. As of Saturday, restaurants must close and school students from fifth grade and up will switch to remote learning Monday.

""We must knock down completely this virus variant,"" Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said Thursday, adding that the mutated virus had been found in 12 people.

Last month, Denmark started culling millions of minks in the north of the country after COVID-19 infections were reported among the stock there. Nationwide, at least 216 out of the 1,139 fur farms in Denmark have now been infected.

Kaare Moelbak of Statens Serum Institut said the virus variant was registered in August and September, and no mutations have been found since, so it was not known if it still exists. The mutated virus was found in five mink farms, according to the government body.

WHO officials said each case needs to be evaluated to determine if any of the changes mean the virus behaves differently.

""We are a long, long way from making any determination of that kind,"" said Mike Ryan, the WHO emergencies chief. He said that such mutations happen all the time in viruses.

""Right now the evidence that we have doesn't suggest that this variant is in any way different in the way it behaves,"" he said in Geneva.

Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on food safety, said that initial studies on pigs, chickens and cattle ""show that these species are not at all susceptible in the same way that mink are, for example. So even if these animals were infected, they would not be able to sustain and spread the disease in the same way.""

Britain on Friday said that people coming from Denmark must self-isolate for 14 days, adding the country to a list of countries it deems risky.

The Danish government said a mutation of the virus had been found in 12 people infected by minks, which farmers have been ordered to cull en masse, but experts said the significance of any variant strain and its effect on humans was unclear because it was yet to be studied.

Denmark, the world's largest mink fur exporter, produces an estimated 17 million furs per year. Kopenhagen Fur, a cooperative of 1,500 Danish breeders, accounts for 40% of the global mink production. Most of its exports go to China and Hong Kong.

The pelts of the mink will be destroyed and Danish fur farmers have said the cull, which is estimated to cost up to 5 billion kroner ($785 million), may spell the end of the industry in the country.

Overall, Denmark has reported 53,180 cases of coronavirus and 738 deaths.

214,2020-11-07 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/07/election-stress-race-over-but-now-nation-looks-normalcy/3755002001/,'Hopefully it will calm down': The election is over. Now a stressed nation looks for normalcy under Joe Biden,"WASHINGTON — Three weeks before the election, Patrick Wall had enough.

He deleted the Facebook app off his phone and turned off Instagram notifications, hoping to shield himself from the latest viral political meme and temptation to engage in another social media fight.

""It was getting to be too much, too often,"" said Wall, 39, a construction company owner from St. Augustine, Florida, who voted for President-elect Joe Biden. ""It was watching people get into stupid arguments about things they were ill-informed on and it was me getting into arguments with people whose minds aren't going to change.""

Biden's victory marked the end of the most bitterly fought presidential elections in recent history, one that divided Americans and had both sides arguing the fate of the nation, even democracy itself, was at stake. A record 145 million people voted, and the total is expected to rise to 150 million after all absentee ballots are counted.

For the past year, friends argued with friends while others simply stopped talking to each other. Family members with opposing views tuned out their relatives. Consumed with the daily drama, both sides lived in separate social media and television bubbles that steered dramatically different outlooks on the race.

But the stress did not vanish Nov. 3. It stretched across four days as results trickled in from a handful of key states. As Trump leveled baseless claims about voter fraud, bleary-eyed Americans watched frenzied television anchors make sense of minor updates, enduring political whiplash as Biden lurched toward the 270 electoral majority.

He finally crossed the threshold when Pennsylvania, and its 20 electoral votes, was called for him Saturday morning – about 89 hours after polls closed on Election Day.

In interviews with voters in six battleground states conducted by the USA TODAY Network before the election, Americans said they felt stressed by the weight of the election, anxious about their candidate's prospects and the uncertainty, disgusted at the other side, angry at the political discourse, and even scared about the violence they feared might play out after its conclusion.

""I'm just ready for it to not dominate every single day of everyone's life,"" Wall said, but added the tension isn't likely to end soon. ""There's probably still going to be a lot of arguing and BS and hopefully at some point it will calm down.""

Pandemic, recession put country on edge

Adding to anxieties, the election collided with a global pandemic that has killed more than 227,000 Americans, drove the U.S. economy into a recession and even sickened a president who repeatedly sought to downplay its grip on America.

The country was rockedby nationwide protests over police conduct and the death of Black Americans at their hands, while the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg jolted a political fight over the future of the high court just one month before Election Day. Democratic voters fumed that President Donald Trump questioned the integrity of the voting process and suggested he may not commit to accepting the election results. Trump supporters accused the media of deliberately not reporting on allegations about the businesses dealing of Biden's son, Hunter Biden.

But for as much as the events of 2020 have cleaved the country and created a powder keg moment, experts say the stress it triggered appears to be a unifying experience for most Americans, regardless of party.

More than two-thirds of adults – 68% – said the 2020 presidential election was a significant source of stress in their life, a marked jump from the 52% who said the same of the 2016 election four years ago, a survey by the Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association found last month.

More:Joe Biden timeline: From Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the White House

Vaile Wright, senior director of health care innovation at the APA, said part of the stress is being driven by the unprecedented level of uncertainty looming over the country and ""an unbelievable level of fatigue.""

The fatigue, she said, is directly related to the pandemic, which has confined millions of Americans to their homes and lingered for months beyond what anyone anticipated.

""There's just no shortage of stressors right now and they're all big, national level ones that leadership really has a massive influence on,"" she said.

3 out of 5 Americans overwhelmed

The APA survey found that 60% of respondents said the sheer number of issues facing America is what overwhelmed them the most, while one in five adults said their mental health is worse than it was at this time last year.

""People are not coping as well as they have been in the past. They're reporting higher levels of disrupted eating, disrupted sleep, that they're not getting as much support as they say they need,"" Wright said. ""What it looks like to me is that people's coping skills are falling short.""

Charles Drew, a fire chief in Southport, North Carolina, who voted for Trump, said he feels ""a little bit of an uneasiness and a little nervousness because I think there's going to continue to be a divide in our country.""

Drew, 46, said supporters defaced yard signs in his small town, near the Atlantic Coast close to Wilmington, N.C.

""It just seems like it's taken a twist in the last four years that it is more volatile or violent,"" he said, acknowledging Trump's rhetoric might have contributed to the shift. ""People are getting, seems like, more hateful. It just seems like there's a shift or something in the country compared to what it has been in the past.""

He said he breathes a ""sigh of relief"" when thinking about all the end of political ads and the piles of mailers in his mailbox each day. But he worried about the toll the election has taken on the nation and whether a feeling of violence among some voters replaced what used to be passion.

""I hate to say that,"" he said. ""But I've seen that from both sides of the spectrum. And that concerns me as far as the direction our nation is heading in.""

Some Americans feel more pressure

While no one has been immune the levels of stress, Wright said some groups seem to be disproportionately affected by recent events.

Individuals with chronic health conditions, members of communities of color, parents of children under the age of 18 and younger adults are among those who reported the highest levels of stress, she said.

Sherly Langer, 55, an accountant from St. Charles, Minnesota, who voted for Trump and worked the polls, said this was the closest she's ever followed an election. She called Americans ""extremely divisive this time.""

""It has been hard to talk to (people) because I think that a lot of people aren't open-minded,"" Langer said. ""We've all kind of drawn our line in the sand and this is who we're going for. I have a sister who is extremely liberal, and we can't even talk about politics.""

More:Kamala Harris breaks glass ceiling as first female vice president, first woman VP of color

A week before the election, Langer self-quarantined in her rural home in southeast Minnesota after being exposed to a niece in college who tested positive for COVID-19.

As the mother of a seventh-grade daughter curious about the election, Langer explained the mudslinging between Trump and Biden by telling her to listen to both sides and keep an opening mind.

Her daughter, who Langer's family adopted from Mexico, drew a line graph that depicted which candidate interrupted more during the first presidential debate in Ohio.

""She came away with the same thing that I did. If I was an undecided voter, I didn't learn anything at that first debate,"" Langer said. Days before the election, Langer jokingly predicted ""peaceful protests"" regardless who won. ""I don't think it's going to be peaceful, but I have the luxury of living in the middle of a cornfield.""

Alyssa Kihoi, 20, of Phoenix, Arizona, said she lost a number of friends and some sorority sisters for voicing her political opinion.

""It's unfortunate, but that's kind of where we're at right now in the world,"" said Kihoi, a member of Arizona State University's College Republicans. ""I lost friends that I was friends with for years, people I grew up with.""

As a first time voter who cast her ballot for Trump, Kihoi said she only became heavily invested in the election over the last six months when the coronavirus crisis unfolded.

""On the local level it's been tough, just seeing everyday COVID numbers and just constant negativity from the media on both ends, right wing and left wing,"" she said. ""Some days are rougher than others. But at the end of the day I think we're all Americans. So whatever it happens, we're all in this together, for sure.""

'A good news story' amid the chaos

While this year's election may have left some voters addled and anxious, one bright spot is that it has shattered early voting records and brought a surge of voters who did not cast a ballot four years ago. Americans endured hours waiting in lines despite the threat of the coronavirus while millions requested absentee ballots in the months and weeks before Election Day.

""It's a good news story,"" McDonald said. ""If there was fatigue, it's probably among the elite because people want have their voices heard. They want their say in the direction of the country.""

Abril Valenzula, an 18-year-old Arizona resident who voted for the first time this year, said the feeling she had most throughout the election was fear.

""I think it's mainly because there's a lot on the line for this election, and I know that whatever outcome comes out of it there will be some risk, there will be some changes,"" she said a few days before Election Day. ""And I think that has been overwhelming, having that uncertainty present during this election cycle.""

Though the election drew more engagement than any in recent memory, some voters never settled with either Biden or Trump.

Pat Browning, 61, of Saline, Michigan did this election the same thing she did in 2016: vote for a third-party candidate. Her absentee vote this year for Libertarian nominee Jo Jorgensen caused her some anxiety – she didn’t want Trump to win re-election, describing him as arrogant and irresponsible – but neither did she want to vote for Biden, disagreeing with him on some key issues, especially abortion rights.

Mostly, she just wanted the election to be over.

“In general, I follow what’s going on but I don’t follow in great detail because it’s very frustrating and ridiculous,” said Browning, who works for a company doing research in early childhood education. “Our candidates aren’t discussing intelligently and civilly and in a respectful manner the problems that are facing our country. I wish they would act like adults.”

Americans stressed about nation's future grew over last year

Browning, who is a Christian, agrees with Democrats on many issues, such as expanding gun control measures, taking steps to provide greater access to health care and fight climate change. But she feels as though politics in recent cycles barely skims the surface of moving toward dealing with big issues “and instead we’re discussing stupid things like a fly on somebody’s head.”

“I’m very irritated by the whole process. I’m irritated by the American system right now,” she said.

Baron Wilson, 58, a mental health professional from Iron Station, North Carolina, voted for Biden. He said he doesn't think ""anybody could be happy"" about the tone of the campaign and couldn't wait – ""win or lose"" – for the race to be over.

The dark rhetoric has been felt on both sides. The president painted a Biden presidency as one that would plunge America into depression and allow left-wing radicals to overtake the country. The former vice president warned that a second term for Trump puts American democracy at stake.

Trump, for his part, embraced divisive rhetoric throughout his presidency, pitting Americans against each other on issues ranging from the removal of Confederate statues to the use of masks to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The rhetoric, experts say, may have played a role in amplifying some of the anxiety that has accompanied this election. According to the APA study, 77% of Americans said the future of the country is a significant source of stress compared to the 69% who said that in 2019.

Wilson, who is African American, pointed to comments from Trump. ""Some of the stuff the president says, I think he could be nicer,"" he said, particularly the president's response to police brutality against Black Americans.

""Let's just get back to where, once it's done campaigning, there will be no need to say nasty things about each other.""

'Toxic political environment' post-2016

After the 2016 election between Trump and Hillary Clinton, researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studied how the race affected Americans' health. Kevin Smith, a political scientist at UNL who led the study, said country has only become more polarized since Trump was elected four years ago.

The ""toxic political environment,"" he says, compounded with a pandemic, a 24-hour news cycle and reliance on social media has created a tinder box environment.

""If you're scrolling through your Facebook or Twitter feed, in the course of five minutes you can be euphoric, scared, frustrated and disgusted and that's pretty big emotional roller coaster-type politics,"" he said, noting that those emotions cause physiological reactions. ""It's hard to conceive a political environment that would be better designed to cause stress and trigger your instinctual emotions.""

Smith, who is conducting a follow-up study to his 2017 research, has also researched the biological underpinnings of political attitudes and behaviors, which he said all leads through the prism of emotion.

""It's all about how people instinctively and emotionally react to messages and stimuli in their environment,"" he said.

While politics is often thought of a rational enterprise, Smith added, his research shows it's all about emotions.

""It's like watching a two-minute drive to win the Super Bowl for six months and for some people that can really put them on an emotional rollercoaster,"" he said. ""This environment couldn't be better suited to trigger those instinctual emotions and one of the downsides is a lot of the emotions triggered are the negative ones.""

Whit Froehlich, a former medical student who is currently unemployed, said he hopes his vote for Biden will bring a moral reset for the country.

Froehlich, who moved from Michigan to Bethesda, Md., with his partner, watched Trump in dismay. He called the election equally ""disappointing and discouraging"" because Trump's actions are apparently ""exciting or reflective of the views of many Americans.""

Hopes for more positive politics over next four years

With a Biden victory, he said he's more optimistic he can ""guide people to essentially be better and demand better, and to select others to do to the same.""

""While I do in some part enjoy the following of it,"" he said of the campaign, ""mostly I would rather do other things, care about other political issues than 'can we get rid of Trump?' And have more substantive action on things that might make a difference in people's lives on a positive sense.""

David McCoy, a 63-year-old Trump supporter from Sarasota, Florida, said he was ready to move on and for the country to move on.

“I’d like us to be able to focus on some other things, both nationally and personally,” McCoy said of his eagerness to turn the page from the 2020 election. “I think it has been stressful to a lot of people.”

A Republican who voted for Trump in 2016, McCoy was even more eager to support the president this time. He pointed to the “the moral slide” of the nation on issues such as abortion and believed Trump would address the problem.

“I pray really hard for this,” he said days before the election. McCoy even wrote a seven-page letter about the “great divide” in the nation and sent it to family and friends.

“It seems like the stakes get more and more serious because of the moral divide in our country,” he said. Although concerned, he said, "" I’m trusting in God, I really am,” he said.

L. Louise Bruce, 62, of Des Moines, Iowa, works as a chaplain with the VA central Iowa Health Care System. She voted Democratic down the ballot, but said too many issues went unaddressed this election, including racism in the country.

“I’m anxious,"" Bruce said, waiting in line to early vote on a cold, snowy evening. ""I want it to be over with. Whatever the outcome is, I want it to be over with. So we can start anew. Whatever that is, whatever that’s going to look like, to start new.”

So how will she feel when it finally is over?

“I don’t know,” she said, laughing. “I may just stay in the bed until noon.”

Opinion contributor

Our long national nightmare, the Trump presidency, is finally nearing an end. But the brutal reality is this: Get ready for another national nightmare now that Joe Biden is the president-elect.

In some ways, that nightmare was heralded by the reckless, inflammatory, irresponsible and unconscionable circus President Donald Trump put on Thursday night from the White House — declaring that his opponents were ""trying to steal an election"" and ""trying to rig an election."" Most networks cut away when Trump started to lie, but the stain still lingers, especially because he has said that he will not concede and accused Biden of ""rushing to falsely pose as the winner.""

It appears that Biden’s margin of electoral victory will make those despicable suggestions moot. So America can soon feel a sense of relief that we have a clear outcome, and gratitude to all the election workers and officials who kept the election itself on course with very few glitches and no signs of chicanery.

What then? The next nightmare, the transition.

Loser keeps power for months

America is unique among established democracies in many ways, among them the extraordinary length of time from an election to the actual transfer of power. Parliamentary systems that have a change in administration make the change overnight. We take 2 1/2 months. That period leaves the losing president in charge, with all his powers, while the winning president-elect prepares to take office.

In modern times, this is a complicated process, as the winner creates a large series of “landing teams,” groups of experts and former officials for each agency, department and office that interact with the existing government executives, career and appointed, to discuss policy history, take possession of key documents necessary to understand what the agency has done and why, and plan for a new agenda with a new team.

There are laws on presidential transitions that provide some protection for an incoming administration, including providing office space and support, and access to agencies. But the ability to have a smooth and productive transition depends heavily on norms.

Transitions are not always smooth, even if they occur within a party. Outgoing people are often glum and resentful, and they don’t always feel an incentive to take time from the jobs they are still performing to help their successors succeed in undoing what they have done. The best transition in modern times was the one from Republican George W. Bush to Democrat Barack Obama, because Bush and his chief of staff Josh Bolten, to their credit, went to great lengths to make sure that all the Bush people cooperated fully with the Obama transition teams.

Trump? He has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition and has complained about his own, referring over and over to the “witch hunt” involving his designated national security adviser Michael Flynn, among others. His antagonism toward Biden and his petulance are not the only problems.

Editor in chief's Backstory: We cut off President Trump's remarks about a ""rigged"" election Thursday night. Here's why.

First, there are the actions he can take as president that will make life for Biden as president more difficult and tumultuous. Expect a slew of executive orders and executive actions. We have already seen this in the weeks leading up to the election. One is designed to blow up the career civil service; it gives the president the authority to put protected employees into a new category that allows them to be fired at will with no appeals. Another opens up the full Tongass National Forest in Alaska to logging, mining and development. We are likely to get a lot more for drilling, fracking and other actions on public lands and more relaxation of clean air and water rules, just to start.

Of course, executive orders and actions taken by one president can be reversed by the next. But it can be a cumbersome and lengthy process, and sometimes, for instance in the case of logging and mining, damage cannot be undone. In 2017, Trump and his Republican Congress were able to use the Congressional Review Act to wipe out Obama-era regulations just by passing laws negating them, and they did that with abandon. If there is a Republican Senate, Biden will not have that option.

Firing Fauci and intelligence pros

Second, expect a slew of pardons — for Trump himself, for his family and staff, for his Cabinet and other officials facing possible charges of corruption and malfeasance. This alone will empower them to act in a reckless fashion, with no possibility of legal backlash, through Jan.19. This group could include the people at several federal agencies carrying out Trump's harsh immigration policies. It could also cover people who violate two laws intended to preserve records, the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act. The desire to cover their tracks by deep-sixing incriminating or embarrassing documents will be strong, from the White House to the State Department to Homeland Security, Commerce and Education.

Third, under his likely illegal executive order on the civil service, Trump can fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and many career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and other agencies that he sees as being disloyal because they followed facts and science. Trump could also fire intelligence professionals who were loyal first to the United States and not him personally.

Of course, they can be reinstated after Jan. 20, but the disruption in the meantime will be substantial, some will have to take other jobs to pay the bills, and the process of reinstatement may be cumbersome.

Fourth is what Trump can do in the foreign policy arena. Possibilities include ways to make it harder to go back to the Iran nuclear deal, an escalation of tariff wars with China and mischief in the Middle East or the Pacific. Or worse.

Fifth is the likelihood that Trump will spend much of his transition time on the road, doing the rallies that soothe his troubled soul when he is surrounded by enthusiastic acolytes. But of course he will use those rallies to reiterate his list of grievances and to foment more division in the country.

Good news amid litany of horrors

All that is in addition to the problems that can arise in the day-to-day contact between Trump officials in agencies and Biden’s transition team. Some might cooperate fully; others will move into full massive resistance. Beyond that, Trump has a large number of vacancies in positions across all agencies and many acting officials in place. In some instances, there will be literally no one home when the Biden team looks for the political appointee in charge.

With this litany of horrors, is there any good news? The answer is yes. The Presidential Transition Act gives a lot of authority to career officials, so resistance from political appointees can be bypassed in most cases. And the author of the act, former Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware, is now heading the transition for Biden. He knows the process better than anybody.

Mastio, Lawrence:Trump-to-Biden transition already unhinged and won't get better

At least some Trump officials, for patriotic or self-interested reasons, or both, will work to make this process smooth and effective. The number could swell if there is a strong public backlash to Trump’s destructive acts, and we might see prominent Republicans in Congress step in as well.

There is also a push by groups inside and outside Congress to prevent the destruction of records. They are trying to inventory what records exist and ensure that career employees do not find themselves culpable by following illegal orders. They are also setting up a whistleblower hotline to create more protection.

All that can help. But unless Trump shows a dramatic change in personality, we need to brace ourselves. Change is coming, thank God, but along the way, fasten seatbelts for severe turbulence.

USA TODAY

All presidential elections are historic in their own way, but 2020 is truly one for the books. The turnout was stupendous, the highest participation rate in more than a century. The result, a nail-biting victory for Joe Biden after days of vote counting, confounded pollsters who had projected a bigger Democratic wave.

Biden, who turns 78 on Nov. 20, becomes the oldest person elected to the nation's highest office. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, becomes the first woman and the first African American to be elected vice president.

Biden's win showed that the majority of voters — exhausted or enraged by the turmoil of Donald Trump's first term — were looking for a change. For the first time in 28 years, they ousted an incumbent.

Divider vs. uniter

They replaced the first president who had no prior public-service experience with a politician who has nearly a half-century of it. They replaced a narcissistic, indecent person with one who is known for being unusually compassionate and caring. They replaced a divider with a uniter.

A decent president who respects the nation's democratic ideals is exactly what is needed at this point, with a nation split by Trump's reign of chaos and in the throes of a worsening public health emergency. ""Let this grim era of demonization end here and now,"" Biden said Saturday night, striking an appropriate and healing tone.

As the election results showed, this remains a nation deeply divided along cultural and political lines. The fact that Trump almost pulled off a stunning upset shows that his brashness continues to resonate with tens of millions of voters. It will not be easy for him, or them, to accept the loss.

And it will not be easy for Biden to govern. Depending on the results of two January runoff elections in Georgia, Republicans might well retain a slim majority in the Senate. And even if Democrats reach 50 seats there, some Democrats representing red states would likely balk at progressive ideas and nominees vigorously opposed by Republicans.

What Joe Biden won't do

Perhaps no other Democratic nominee besides Biden could have carried the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he was born. And perhaps more than anyone the Democrats could have fielded, Biden can bring his humanity to play in restoring some of the things that have been lost in this country in nearly four years.

Part of Biden's appeal is the things he won't do: attack doctors and scientists in the midst of a deadly pandemic; attack the integrity of our democratic institutions; profit off the presidency while withholding his tax returns from the public; traffic in racist fearmongering; send unhinged tweets from the White House at all hours of the day and night.

But Biden perhaps can do more. There is a reason that attempts to smear him fell flat. The American people know him well, and he has built up a reservoir of goodwill. He can use that goodwill to the national advantage.

The first order of business is to get America out of the hole it is in from the pandemic, which claimed 1,529 lives on Election Day alone, according to The COVID Tracking Project. This means developing a coherent national strategy to contain the virus until a vaccine is ready, then building public confidence in a vaccination program. It also means another financial relief bill, if not in a lame-duck congressional session then early next year.

Another high priority is to restore America's tattered global reputation by rejoining the Paris climate accord, from which the United States officially withdrew Wednesday.

Beyond that, the details of a legislative strategy can be worked out over time. For now, in many ways America just needs a return to the normality that previous presidents of both parties exhibited.

President-elect Joe Biden's victory represents the political equivalent of Alka-Seltzer, a product introduced 11 years before he was born. As the old commercial jingle put it: Oh, what a relief it is."

Opinion columnist

Since 1896 when Democrat William Jennings Bryan conceded the presidency to William McKinley, every loser has followed his precedent. “[T] he returns indicate your election, and I hasten to extend my congratulations. We have submitted the issue to the American people and their will is law,” Bryan wrote in a telegram.

So began the American custom of the losers in the presidential sweepstakes conceding to the victors. Over 120 years, Americans have witnessed 32 such speeches — by telegram, radio, live TV, and most recently YouTube. While there’s no law that requires any losing candidate to acknowledge defeat, it’s become an American tradition intrinsic to the orderly transition of power. To that point presidential historian Robert Dallek told the Los Angeles Times that these speeches “demonstrate a continuing commitment to peaceful transitions of power.” He added that they also send an important “signal to supporters that they need to join the defeated candidate in accepting the loss.”

Yesterday when all the networks (including Trump’s once beloved Fox) and USA TODAY called the election for Joe Biden, Donald Trump blew up this patriotic custom of calling for unity. He responded by refusing to concede, even threatening additional legal challenges and claimed in a statement, “Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner…. The simple fact is this election is far from over.”

Only an hour before Trump had tweeted, completely erroneously, “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” (which Twitter noted was untrue).

Both Democrats and Republicans have consistently maintained this long-held custom, which is really about closure and continuity. “The whole campaign is a formalized warfare,” Paul Corcoran, a political theorist who studies U.S. presidential campaigns, told NPR last week. “The more I looked at the concession speech, the more I realized that [it serves] an important political function. There needs to be a ceremonial recognition of an end.” Its ultimate purpose, he added, isn’t about losing candidates accepting their fate but about bridging divides so that their supporters will accept it.

More:Donald Trump has lost to Joe Biden, what's next? The presidential transition from hell.

When Democrat Jimmy Carter became a one-term president (much like Trump), losing to Ronald Reagan in 1980, he publicly recommitted to American democracy, saying, “I have a deep appreciation of the system, however, that lets people make a free choice about who will lead them for the next four years.”

Similarly, when Republican Richard Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960, in a very tight contest, he, too, called for Americans to come together. “I have great faith that our people, Republicans, Democrats alike, will unite behind our next president.”

Sure, there’s a formula to these speeches, starting with a call for unity, a recommitment to democracy, and a vow to continue the fight for their own causes. To that last point, when Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey, the sitting vice president, lost to Nixon in 1968, he emphasized, “I shall continue my personal commitment to the cause of human rights, to peace and the betterment of man.” This part of the formula gives any loser--including Trump--a way to try to cement his legacy and signal to his supporters that he’s not abandoning them.

Some concession speeches have gone beyond the expected, reaching notes of grace. In 2008 Republican John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama (the first Black man elected president) told a crowd in Phoenix. “This is an historic election... And I recognize the special significance it has for African Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.”

He continued: “I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises, to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.”

Even Democrat Hillary Clinton, smarting from her surprise loss to Trump four years ago, rallied by telling a hotel crowd: “Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. We don’t just respect that. We cherish it.”

Perhaps Trump needs a writing prompt to help him with this speech. I would actually refer him to Clinton’s speech. “Joe Biden is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. We don’t just respect that. We cherish it.” And I’d also suggest that he paraphrase McCain’s concession, in this case referencing vice-president elect Kamala Harris. “This is an historic election... And I recognize the special significance it has for Black Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.”

With more lawsuits coming on Monday that’s a pipe dream. After all it was Trump who told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace in July, “I’m not a good loser. I don’t like to lose.” Mr. President: With history in the making, you have one last chance to redeem yourself. The whole world is watching.

Opinion contributor

It was third grade when I experienced my first bout of depression — far too young to know what it was, or what it meant.

I remember trying to tell my mom what I was feeling; I said I was “bored.” She wasn’t particularly moved by that description of symptoms, and who could blame her? I was 10 — or however old you are in the third grade — and what did I really have to complain about? There was a roof over my head, I belonged to a family, had clothes to wear, three meals a day and had a plethora of ways to entertain myself. Trouble is, the chemicals in our brains aren’t acutely aware of how good we may have it.

How Eddie Van Halen came into my life

There are an endless amount of eulogies noting instrumental virtuosity, two-hand tapping, “the brown sound,” and probably some criticizing Eddie Van Halen himself, who died Oct. 6. I’d like to share a personal story of how the inherent joy in Van Halen’s guitar playing helped me channel my chronic depression into discipline, gave me a purpose and probably saved my life.

Back in the days of VHS, my family rented a copy of “Back to the Future.” The scene where Marty McFly (as Darth Vader) forces his point of view upon his father, via a Walkman and a Van Halen cassette, was an admittedly random epiphany. My despondency and boredom had escalated into anger, rebellion and suicidal thoughts. If I could just blast something at my parents that loud and that forcefully, maybe they’d understand what I didn’t yet have the words to explain.

USA TODAY Editorial Board:Election results: Patience. Neither Trump nor Biden will determine who wins. Counting votes will.

I begged for an electric guitar for the better part of a year, until they finally gave in. I did weeks of extra chores to buy a boombox. I snuck an envelope and a stamp, taped a penny onto the form, and mailed it to the ""12 CDs for One-Cent"" BMG Music Service. I ordered “Van Halen,” the self-titled debut, “1984” and “Live: Right Here, Right Now.”

I tried to find other things that might tick my folks off. I misread Santana as “Satana,” but despite evocative song titles like “Black Magic Woman,” the music proved more festive than evil. However, Pantera’s “Cowboys from Hell” and Slayer’s “Reign in Blood” were well chosen.

Music helped regulate my emotions

My plan to announce whatever chemical imbalance I was experiencing by overwhelming adults with loud noise went out the window on my first listen through “Live: Right Here, Right Now.” It was as heavy and cathartic as I’d hoped it would be, but more than that, it was joyful. Instead of being a vehicle to describe the pain I felt, it was the album that taught me that music could help regulate my emotions.

Suzette Hackney:In a country divided, it's up to us to unite

It became my own suburban kid version of self-care. Before I could jam along, I’d just jump around to it with my guitar. While Sammy Hagar’s vocals might as well have been an audiobook compared to the unintelligible grunge songwriters I’d later come to love, the sexual-innuendo-by-any-means-necessary aesthetic of most Van Halen lyrics was lost on my preteen naiveté. What I heard first and foremost was a guitarist having the time of his life. And like so many others, I wanted to be him.

In the days and years since then, my story surely amalgamates with the scores of musicians grieving this legend. I listened to those CDs every day. I took lessons. I skipped school to practice. I could play a sloppy version of “Eruption” by the time I was 14. In essence, guitar became the crux of my identity the day that BMG box arrived in the mail.

The key to feeling whole

Throughout those years that I lacked the verbal maturity to tell anyone what was wrong, it often felt like music was all I had — and Van Halen was often the key to feeling whole.

Before receiving the news of Eddie’s death, I had spent the morning editing vocals on a mix. While recording them, I had actually used that cliché producer tactic of telling a tired singer that the listener can hear a smile. My first thought upon reading that heartbreaking headline was that Eddie Van Halen is the only guitarist whose smile you could hear.

Rest in peace. Thank you for everything.

You've won back your boundaries and sanity, if only for a short while.

No more pamphlets and mailers. No more emails pleading, ""Will you rush an urgent $3 donation"" to a candidate.

No more text messages exhorting you to help get out the vote for one party or another.

And no more TV ads that vacillate between saccharine self-promotion of one candidate or character assassination of the other.

Political ads offer no enlightenment

Talk about lowering the bar on civics, to say nothing of human decency.

It'd be forgivable if the totality of the efforts amounted to some payoff, some revelation. On a door-hanger advertisement, one candidate in my legislative district lists among her top priorities as upholding the U.S. and Arizona constitutions and strengthening adherence to the rule of law.

You don’t say.

On a mailer, a mayoral hopeful touts a platform of fighting city corruption, making Phoenix safe and bringing manufacturing jobs back to Phoenix. Hmm, OK. Not aware these are overriding problems.

USA TODAY Editorial Board:Donald Trump's attack on election integrity cries for Republican come-to-Goldwater moment

In a flurry of dueling mailers, the state senator in my district reduces her opponent to a tax-raising, law enforcement-hating extremist, while the opponent caricatures her as a monarch in a fantasyland who shills for the health insurance companies.

They work up the electorate’s umbrage, if not its IQ.

An idea we can rally around: Opt-out ads

Heck, I'd settle for appropriate timing with the attack ads. Half or more of the onslaught came well after many of us had already sent back our ballots — are the campaigns aware that mail-in voting begins in early October?

Does all this blustering really move the needle? The partisanship in our body politic is so hardened now, are there really that many undecideds who look for guidance off these hackneyed sale pitches?

I'd imagine if the political parties truly care about the electorate, an inspired member among the ranks would propose the grand idea of allowing voters to opt-out of election advertising.

Election 2020:Donald Trump's most historic and dishonest press conference

Better yet, to borrow from the internet users bill of rights and data privacy protection, require citizens to opt-in for political advertising on any device or platform. Those who are subjected to politicking barrages via text, calls, emails and snail mail should at least be willing participants.

That would be a win for both bipartisanship and voter rights.

Enjoy the election ad peace. It won't last

Until then, we deserve to toast ourselves for securing a reprieve from the increasingly asinine practice we charitably call political advertising.

At least for the next year and a half or so, because before you can say midterms or ""the most important election in our lifetime,"" election 2022 will be upon us.

USA TODAY

Jill: Don’t throw away those sleep aids and stomach acid tablets quite yet. America has elected a new president, but what now? The worst could be yet to come from Donald Trump, the president who, alas, we still have for more than two months.

I used to fret about last-minute flurries of destruction, that we’d wake up one day to find he had gutted the federal workforce or some crucial bipartisan environmental regulation. Now I fear for the basics of democracy and actual physical danger to Americans.

On the other hand, maybe Trump will recede into a twilight presidency — still famous and possibly rich (who knows), still dominating cable and social media, but not exactly president. Especially if he decided to do this from Florida, or maybe Scotland, that would be nice. Or Greenland. There’s never a bad time to buy your own country.

'Lock him up' or gracious concession?

The one thing we can’t expect is what we have expected of all previous presidents: Trump conscientiously does his job and helps President-elect Joe Biden transition into office. He never has done the first (that would require discipline and selflessness), and it’s much easier to imagine him leading chants of “lock him up” than graciously handing over the reins of power.

David: We’re in an unsettling moment. A mentally ill president has just suffered an incredible blow to his ego, and we have no idea how he will react beyond continuing to spew falsehoods that undermine faith in our democracy among those many millions who still follow the man. Will there be mass firings of political appointees? Unhinged executive orders? Something worse?

And that’s not the only uncertainty. For the next 10 weeks or so, Trump is going to have to share the stage with Biden as the president-elect inches toward assuming the presidency. Will Trump see the attention shifting to Biden and act to bring the spotlight back onto himself? How far could he go in doing that? How far will his Cabinet let him go before invoking the 25th Amendment?

Trump never reaches bottom

One thing I have learned from watching Trump these last four years is that he never reaches bottom. There is always something worse he can do.

As for the formal transition, I doubt Trump will help it along at all. But Biden is the best positioned president-elect to deal with that lack of support of any new president since George H.W. Bush in 1989. Biden can lean on former President Barack Obama and his team as well as his own executive branch experience. I doubt there are any adults left on Trump’s staff to ensure that Biden gets all the assistance he needs.

Jill: Some of the remaining adults may be gone soon. Multiple reports suggest Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering resigning ahead of getting fired by Trump. FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel also have surfaced in many reports on Trump’s post-election “execution list,” as Axios calls it.

That would be a sweep of national security leaders at a moment of U.S. vulnerability: the transition from one president to another. In more bad timing, Trump is also speculating about firing Dr. Anthony Fauci (if he can) just as cold weather arrives and coronavirus cases spike.

Fictitious world:Trump's huge vote total breaks my heart. I recognize this America and I wish I did not.

Attorney General William Barr is another reason to be on edge. What will he be up to in the next few weeks? Will he lead the taxpayer-funded Department of Justice into court to try to keep Trump in the presidency? Will he make vote fraud claims that are about as well documented as Trump tweets, or press releases masquerading as “executive orders”? It sounds crazy, but no crazier than Barr claiming DOJ should defend Trump on a rape allegation (which he denies) from long before he became president.

And we can’t discount the prospect of Trump attempting to pardon himself to avoid future legal troubles. Here’s the corollary to your point that there is no bottom, he can always hit new lows: He doesn’t ask permission or forgiveness. He just does whatever the hell he wants. And he has never yet paid a price for it.

David: Never paid a price? He lost a presidential election. Can you imagine if he were just a little bit less dishonest, corrupt and unhinged? He might have won this thing. The key states he lost (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and headed that way in Georgia) appear to be only by a few thousand or a few tens of thousands of votes each.

And that’s what we’re going to be sorting out well into the Biden presidency. What is it about Trump that landed him a record number of votes for a Republican? What gave him so many million Hispanic votes and so many Black votes? Was it the uniformly conservative policy? The strong economy until the pandemic hit? Or was it the populist rhetoric that focused on abusing the media and the experts across the board? How can Republicans build on Trump — by adopting his rhetorical style or standing up for Republican values on policy and the culture war more stridently?

Election 2020 exit polls:Political pundits utterly failed to predict shy Donald Trump voters

I don’t know the answer to that question, but judging from my closest family members who are Trump supporters, the core of his appeal is a sense of shared animosity toward those most powerful in business and culture. The media, tech firms, experts, people with graduate degrees. Republicans are going to be trying to bottle Trump’s successes without his downsides for years.

But now we’re entering the Biden era. How will he adapt to split control of the Senate (at best) and narrow control of the House while trying to rebuild our divided country from four years of heedless destruction? That’s the bigger question, and now there is no obvious answer.

Opinion contributor

The story of the 2020 election is that Black voters came through for President-elect Joe Biden.

When Biden’s primary campaign was written off by many, Black voters of South Carolina handed him a big win. Biden’s strength with African Americans helped him to secure the Democratic Party’s nomination.

This week, Black voters in Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta have determined the outcome of our presidential election. It’s striking that people who have been failed and treated the worst by our democracy (and by extension our criminal justice system) consistently do the most to save it.

It is high time for Biden and the Democratic Party to deliver justice for African Americans and other communities of color that are disproportionately discarded and forgotten within the justice system.

Biden's history on criminal justice

Our justice system is rooted in racism, and African Americans have been hit hardest by it. Still, the Black voters had huge turnouts in cities Democrats needed to be competitive.

Last year, when Biden spoke on criminal justice issues, he admitted: “I know we haven’t always gotten things right,” surely referring, in part, to the 1994 crime bill that he supported and that is often blamed for today's mass incarceration problem.

Until recently, candidates running for president competed to look tough on crime and paint their opponents as soft. But 2020 has been different.

The downfalls of our criminal justice system have been exposed for all to see, from the police killings of George Floyd (a Black man who was taken out by a police officer who put a knee on his neck) and Breonna Taylor (a Black woman shot to death by police in her own home) to the deaths of jailed Americans before they even had their day in court.

COLUMN:As a Black female law professor, I'm nurturing a system that doesn't protect people like me

The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, a result of decades of bipartisan legislation — like the 1994 crime bill — that propped up institutional racism. About 2.3 million people are locked up in jails and prisons, and 40% of those locked up are Black Americans (who are 13% of society).

American mass incarceration is a human rights catastrophe.

Biden, fortunately, has evolved on this issue.

In 2007, before becoming President Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden sponsored the Second Chance Act, which provides services to formerly incarcerated individuals and has gone a long way toward lowering the recidivism rate. As a senator, Biden also supported the full elimination of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.

Young Black voters who did not back Biden in the Democratic primaries are the same Black youth who are protesting in the streets right now, who hold his political record as responsible for the pain they are feeling, and rightfully so.

As president, it's his duty to right those wrongs, and do right by the community that garnered his White House victory.

President-elect must question, change institutions

America needs a bold agenda that goes further than small reforms or hollow public relations moves.

The Biden administration must enlarge their field of vision. Rather than focusing on the problems of the institution and asking what needs to be changed, they must raise radical questions about the existence of these institutions to begin with.

COLUMN:To our next president: 10 priorities for fixing our justice system

What principles underpin the founding and evolution of the police, the courts and our prisons? Do those principles bend toward justice, or cause suffering and harm?

A strong first step would be to support the BREATHE Act. This proposed legislation would eliminate the federal government's ability to give multimillion dollar grants for the militarization of police forces, and calls for a “time-bound plan” to close all federal immigration detention centers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons' pandemic response has demonstrated a lack of regard for basic humanity that has created deadly conditions for those who are incarcerated.

Instead of a punishment paradigm, the BREATHE Act creates a new community public safety agency, which uses grants to replace the harmful criminal legal systems locally with evidence-based public safety infrastructure. Importantly, the act moves the function of public safety surrounding the war on drugs out of the Department of Justice and into the Department of Health and Human Services — signaling a dramatic shift in how our society approaches community well-being.

The investments that the BREATHE Act makes — in education, health care, the environment, wealth generation for working class families and housing — creates public safety by supporting communities rather than punishing them.

POLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media

If you truly want people to participate in society, you do not pass laws that keep them from doing so. More than 6 million people are not allowed to vote today due to a felony conviction, something the BREATHE Act would immediately change if passed.

We need to create space for budgets to be divested from police and prisons and invested directly into communities to address mental health needs, homelessness, access to critical education and rewarding jobs as well as community-based methods of accountability.

We know that prisons won’t be bulldozed tomorrow, and the complete elimination of the justice system can’t be done in one fell swoop. But in the meantime, people need to continue to confront the criminal justice system and face the harm of incarceration.

We are calling for the Biden administration to fundamentally shift their thinking and approach to make it possible for all communities to be safe and free.

Opinion contributor

It feels like deliverance, like relief, like we can all finally exhale. After stressful wait, and even as recounts may loom, President Donald Trump’s defeat means he can do no more damage to our faith in each other and to the world’s faith in us. His cruelty, lies and narcissism defiled these precious treasures that generations sacrificed to build. A new beginning under a Democratic administration that puts the ugly scars of the past four years behind us is possible. But what direction will it, and should it, take?

The Democrats need to examine how they could have lost in 2016 and merely eked out a narrow victory in 2020 to someone so lacking in presidential qualities, so lacking in character, that winning now feels more like a reprieve than a triumph. They need to engage in critical introspection to avoid future Trumps. The fire next time awaits if they don’t draw the right conclusions.

First, the election highlighted the Democrats’ continued problem with white working-class and rural voters. Biden was able to reduce the margin of defeat among these groups compared with 2016, but they were still an anchor of Trump support. These groups’ continued antagonism means they remain a potent threat that smarter, more adroit, less self-destructive Trumps could mobilize in future elections.

Trump exposed Democratic weakness

These voters continue to regard the Democratic Party as indifferent to their concerns, even as their communities are wracked with deaths of despair from suicide and opioid addiction, and as contemptuous of their values, even as Democrats claim to be the party of inclusion. To attract these voters, Democrats don’t need to sacrifice their principles, but they do need to stop contemptuously ignoring them and start signaling their lives matter.

Second, Trump’s policies were chaotic, dangerous and shortsighted. But he also exposed weaknesses in the policy consensus to which previous Republican and Democratic administrations subscribed. One of them was Trump’s skepticism of trade agreements that devastated working-class jobs, living standards and communities. The United States can’t afford to underwrite neoliberal, free trade policies that harm the manufacturing sector any longer. The Democrats need to unfriend Davos Man.

The other policy underbelly that Trump exposed was immigration. The public overwhelmingly approves of legal immigration (84% in 2018, according to Gallup) but has long been troubled by illegal immigration. Each year since 2010, half to two-thirds have said that they worry about it a great deal or a fair amount. To want to return to higher pre-Trump rates of legal immigration and at the same time oppose illegal immigration is not unjust or anti-immigrant. The Democrats need to secure the borders because there is little appetite for open ones.

No hysterics, please:When your presidential candidate loses, here's what to do

Finally, the nation is tired of its own discord. The country faced a similar time of weariness with its own divisions as the Civil War neared its conclusion after four grueling years of turmoil and bloodshed. President Abraham Lincoln spoke to this moment in his second inaugural address, whose words are inscribed today on the north interior wall of the Lincoln Memorial.

Balance of resolve and empathy

His address came as the Union Army advanced on the battlefield and Republicans succeeded at the polls. Despite these victories, the tone of his speech was subdued and solemn, never triumphal or boastful. In it, Lincoln attempted to chart a path between welcoming the South back into the Union — “with malice toward none; with charity for all,” he famously wrote — and remaining true to the principles of why he waged war against it in the first place, to defend the Union and end slavery.

The Democrats would do well to follow the difficult path Lincoln laid out and avoid becoming either too dogmatic or too conciliatory. The former often presents itself as self-righteousness, the latter as a lack of self-confidence. Democrats need to be humble toward Trump voters, just as Lincoln offered solace to Confederates, and be self-assured in pursuing their agenda, just as Lincoln promised to follow through and end slavery. Democrats need to express empathy for those who voted against them and resolution in support of those who did.

Stark reality:Trump's huge vote total breaks my heart. I recognize this America and I wish I did not.

Lincoln never could implement the dexterous strategy he laid out in his second inaugural address. He was killed just 41 days after he delivered it to the nation.

We’ll see whether President-elect Joe Biden can exhibit the statesmanship that an assassin’s bullet prevented Lincoln from displaying. In his acceptance speech at the Democratic Party convention, Biden said he would work “as hard for those who didn’t support me as I will for those who did. That’s the job of a president.”

Just this week, expressing confidence in the outcome as the count went on, he told the country: ""There will be no blue states and red states when we win, just the United States of America.""

We’ll see how well Biden can square the circle: deliver to his voters at the same time he tries to heal our wearying and dysfunctional political divisions.

Opinion contributor

It happened.

Joe Biden has become president-elect, and President Donald Trump lost to 2020 itself.

In this terrible year, multiple crises boiled over — from a global pandemic to a U.S. economic catastrophe, wildfires and hurricanes, and a historic reckoning with police violence and systemic racism.

Voters gave Trump the boot because in each and every case, he either ignored those crises or made them worse. And even as we turn the page on Trump, we can't call it a day, move on with our lives, and forget about politics. All of the crises he either ignored or enflamed are still raging.

Let’s face it, there’s no going back from protesting to brunch. Our problems were always much bigger than Trump.

The past eight months have punctured the myth of American exceptionalism, which told us that we were better because we were better. Our systems and institutions were intrinsically, objectively superior to the rest of the world's, and that accounted for the wealth of our people and the power of our empire.

It was the same kind of mythologizing that convinced the world Trump was a genius businessman. But that was a lie. Trump was a failed real estate mogul. He is the survivor of multiple bankruptcies, and recent reporting has shown that Trump’s losses in recent years have far exceeded his income.

Similarly, there is nothing magically or mystically ""great"" about America. We are as susceptible, as precarious and as subject to disaster as any other country — and our anemic institutions are less resilient than many.

For four decades, this country has embraced a political philosophy of neoliberalism. We shrank the public sphere and shifted risk from big companies to working people. And where we did make major public investments, it was in jails. We made less progress in schools and mental health care and social services.

COLUMN:Joe Biden, Black voters made you president. It's time to right wrongs on criminal justice.

The result is yawning inequality and a system that’s fragile by design. Black communities in particular were underserved and overpoliced. Is it any wonder that when COVID-19 hit, we were caught flat-footed? Or that when George Floyd was killed at the knee of a Minnesota police officer, tens of millions took to the streets to declare that Black lives matter?

Because this wasn’t just a failure of management, firing the manager isn’t enough. It requires a comprehensive, systemic response.

Biden and the new Congress have their work cut out for them. They'll have to fix the problems Trump ignored or made worse, and answer some tough questions Americans across the country are asking.

COLUMN:To our next president: 10 priorities for fixing our justice system

Here are just a few:

►If we can spend trillions of dollars to bail corporations out, can't we afford things like universal health care and a real, robust plan to fight climate change?

►If some of our lowest paid, most expendable workers are in fact “essential” to survive this pandemic, shouldn't all work have dignity and pay that reflects workers’ importance? Shouldn't workers have a say over the conditions of their workplaces?

►If corporations actually rely on government bailouts to make it through a crisis, shouldn't we the people get a share of the profits, and have a say that ensures companies are run in the best interests of workers and the public, not just bosses and shareholders?

►And finally, if Black people are vastly more likely to die at the hands of the police than white people, shouldn't we divest public money from policing and incarceration, and invest in schools, health care, housing, jobs and social services that will allow Black people to thrive in America?

Opinion contributor

President-elect Joe Biden, hero, has vanquished the poison-spewing dragon Donald Trump from our imperiled land. He did so with dignity, honesty, substance, optimism and good manners. We owe this most long-serving of public servants an extraordinary debt of gratitude and appreciation.

The election, tragically, did not deliver a hammer blow of repudiation to Trumpism and its Republican appeasers and collaborators. Biden did not have coattails; he barely had a jacket.

But that is not Biden’s fault; it is the fault of the country that is America today. One healer can only do so much in a society as fractured and infected as ours, crippled by a pandemic and unemployment, freshly wounded by the ancient legacy of racism, and disoriented by the constant bombardment of always-on media –— social and anti-social, information and misinformation, local and global.

Always underestimated, Joe Biden did his part. He received more votes than any president-elect in history.

Pummeled from all directions

In the primaries, Biden stayed steady and good-humored as he was doubted by every pundit and pummeled from every conceivable angle by every conceivable kind of candidate: Sen. Elizabeth Warren from the Left, Sen. Bernie Sanders from the Far Left, Marianne Williamson from Planet Love, Pete Buttigieg from grad school, Michael Bloomberg from his bank vaults, and so on.

As the campaign went on, Biden modified his platform as he learned from the electorate and reached out to his opponents. He backed free public college education for some, college loan forgiveness programs, lowering the Medicare eligibility age, Warren’s bankruptcy reform ideas and a slate of very specific criminal justice reforms.

This is a sign of maturity and undogmatic wisdom, not flip-floppery.

When COVID hit, Biden was the perfect role model. He wore his mask, shunned mass events and kept his staff and supporters healthy. He quickly ditched the idea of trying to pull off a semi-normal in-person convention and he did so without whining or self-pity. He supported science, medicine, reason and kindness.

Biden made a bold statement with the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate after a discreet and dignified process .

At the dreaded moment when he had to step into debate ring and counter the guerilla (gorilla?) techniques of a liar, cheater and screamer, Biden held his composure. He acted like an actual human being, not a politician, and impressed a large national audience that wasn’t at all sure he could hack it.

Biden stayed true to his core mission

When the sitting president, whose children have disgraced the presidency, attacked his family, Biden — a man who has buried a wife and two children — turned the other cheek.

Most of all, Biden never wavered from what his gut told him was the central mission of his candidacy: restoring the soul of America.

Biden may not have a Democratic Senate to support him.

So, the energy, volunteerism and brain power that went into electing Joe Biden now needs to pour into helping him rebuild the competence and integrity of the federal government and vanquish the remaining wreckage of this awful era of Trump.

Don’t underestimate what our next president can achieve.

Opinion contributor

I’ve been spending some time staring into the witches’ cauldron of presidential politics, also known as the exit polls.

I’m using data collected by Edison Research and used by CNN, for whom I serve as an on-air contributor. These exit polls combine in-person interviews of nearly 8,000 Election Day voters at 115 polling locations nationwide, with nearly 5,000 phone interviews with early and absentee voters.

Coverage of the Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden campaign largely focused on four groups: women, racial minorities, senior citizens and suburban voters. Conventional wisdom held that Trump would be slaughtered by all of them, thereby handing Biden a landslide.

Turns out, that was almost entirely incorrect. Trump improved over his 2016 performance among Black women (+4 percentage points), Black men (+5), Latinas (+3) and Latinos (+4).

It is almost certainly true that minority voters turned out in far larger numbers in 2020 than in 2016, racking up critical votes for Biden in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, but Democratic strategists must be wondering what it means that Trump earned a larger share of the nonwhite vote than any GOP presidential candidate since 1960.

Think about all of the articles, cable panels and breathless speculation you heard over the past four years about “draconian” immigration policies and race issues — especially this year! — and now consider just what a fun-house mirror that really was.

Polls vs. reality

But the women! Surely they abandoned ship, right? Nope. Trump performed exactly as he did in 2016, losing them by 13 points.

In national polls the gender gap was enormous, often showing Trump losing women by 20 points or more. And yet that margin failed to materialize on Election Day. Among white women — often seen screaming the loudest at anti-Trump protests — Trump actually improved by 3 points.

As we search for reasons why polling seems to capture Democratic vote share but not Republican, a narrative is emerging: Some minorities and women were indeed shy Trump voters the pollsters missed.

Election coverage:2020 was a referendum on Donald Trump. But liberals didn't get off scot-free, either.

Where did Trump lose support? Senior citizens (-4 points over his 2016 performance) and white me. In fact, Biden might have white men to thank more than any other group for possibly winning the White House. In 2016, Trump won white men by 31 points. This time? Just 18 points, the only racial cohort to show degradation for the 45th president.

White males with college degrees really hurt the president. Last time, Trump won them by 14 points, and this time he lost them by 2 points, a massive swing. We spent all our time talking about yoga moms, and it turns out that their husbands were swinging harder than they were.

Where do these white college educated elites live? The suburbs! In 2016, Trump won the 'burbs by 4 points but lost them by 3 points this year, a 7-point swing. At least that part of the punditry was accurate.

A political realignment

What’s apparent to me is that Donald Trump has realigned the two parties, with the GOP emerging as a working-class party and the Democrats becoming a home for privileged elites who tend to be more educated and have more money (high incomes, trust funds, inheritances).

Rural America again sent a loud and clear message that it isn’t happy with the Democratic Party. Even though Biden won the race, you can see in the election results that rural, working-class voters feel completely abandoned by the Democratic Party, a trend that began during the Obama years and truly ruptured in 2016.

Backstory:We cut off President Trump's remarks about a ""rigged"" election Thursday night. Here's why.

Identity politics has once again failed the Democratic Party, and elite scolding of rural Americans over various issues has backfired tremendously. The application of different coronavirus standards, for instance, rankled rural conservatives greatly. Want to go to church or a Trump rally? That makes you a murderer to many in the media and the Democrats. But go to a protest, a riot or an anti-Trump event and you get magical COVID-19 immunity, apparently.

The failure by liberal elites to admit that it was leftist protesters tearing up cities and fully condemn them left a bad taste in the mouth of law-abiding Americans who would never dream of breaking society’s laws and norms. Trump’s voters know that if they burned a building or knocked down a statue, they would be tossed in jail immediately. But they saw anarchists destroying property with impunity on their television screens for much of the year — and the liberals coddling them, even denying that it was happening at all — and wondered: Why don’t the rules apply equally to everyone?

Working-class Americans aren’t rich enough to be woke; they just want to go to work, attend church and take their kids to school without being condemned for it.

So how did the pundits and pollsters get it wrong? Simple — most of them live in blue bubbles that badly distort their understanding of nonurban America. They look at millions of people as political properties — where race, income and education determine your politics — instead of as fellow Americans, free to make up their own minds. Rural, working-class Americans and minorities are tired of the double standards, the browbeatings, and being taken for granted by liberals who clearly don’t know them at all.

Here's why (and how).,"We're going to get rid of the Electoral College, but it won't be by way of Congress.

The states will do it, eventually.

Elections like the one we're involved in, and several others in the recent past, will cause us to come to our senses and do away with an outdated, unfair, undemocratic political dinosaur.

Nevada lawmakers last year passed a bill meant to guarantee that all of the votes cast by its citizens in a presidential election actually … count.

Imagine that.

This doesn’t happen in Arizona.

Or plenty of other states.

But there is a movement on to make it happen nationwide, and Nevada was the 15th state to join it. The Nevada bill would have agreed to give all of the state’s electoral votes to the candidate who wins the nationwide popular vote. Unfortunately, it was vetoed by Gov. Steve Sisolak.

14 states want a National Popular Vote

That will change in time. Common sense will win out.

If enough states pass such legislation (and the momentum is building in that direction) the anti-democratic vestige of slavery known as the Electoral College would go the way of other political shams.

An organization called National Popular Vote is out to eliminate the Electoral College without tampering with the Constitution.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have committed to the cause.

When enough states join the effort to reach 270 electoral votes, the passed bills from all the states will kick in and guarantee that the candidate with the highest vote total nationwide would become the president.

As it should be.

President Donald Trump used to believe this, once tweeting in 2012: ""The electoral college is a disaster for democracy.""

He changed his mind after that ""disaster"" got him elected.

Why was the Electoral College created?

The construction of the Electoral College wasn’t exactly about moral certainty or about protecting small states (I hear that all the time) or anything like that. It was a simple power play by slave states.

Election 2020:Donald Trump's most historic and dishonest press conference

Presidential electors are granted based on population. Slave states wanted their slaves counted in their population numbers (even though they weren’t citizens and could not vote) in order to give themselves more votes in the Electoral College. The “compromise” that was reached, grotesque as it now seems, was that each slave counted for three-fifths of a person.

It was the idea of James Madison, a slave owner, and the representatives of Southern states.

Those states had the most people — but only if slaves were counted. As Paul Finkelman, visiting law professor at University of Saskatchewan in Canada, pointed out, “None of this is about slaves voting. The debates are in part about political power and also the fundamental immorality of counting slaves for the purpose of giving political power to the master class.”

Marginalizing most states

A co-founder of National Popular Vote is John Koza, described by The New York Times as someone who helped invent scratch lottery tickets.

The National Popular Vote would finally eliminate the false premise that the Electoral College was meant to protect small states. In fact, our system reduces a presidential election to a few battleground states and voids millions of votes.

USA TODAY Editorial Board:Donald Trump's attack on election integrity cries for Republican come-to-Goldwater moment

Koza said, “Everybody’s vote should count. But entire campaigns run around a couple of states and that, in turn, distorts government policy.”

A few years back, the Arizona House, by a 40-16 margin that crossed political lines, passed a bill to join the effort.

Then-Senate President Andy Biggs would not let the bill come to a vote in the Senate, however.

J.D. Mesnard, who introduced the bill, said in 2016, ""Our presidential elections have come down to 10 battleground states. Arizona is so decidedly Republican that neither Democrats nor Republicans find it necessary or beneficial to campaign here. Arizona's issues are ignored because Arizona voters don't matter.""

His view may have changed since Trump was elected in 2016 by winning in the Electoral College while getting trounced by nearly three million votes.

This isn’t about Trump, however. Or any other candidate. It isn’t about Republicans or Democrats.

It’s about divesting ourselves of a process for electing the leader of the free world by way of a system designed to count slaves as three-fifths human.

Opinion contributor

At the outset of COVID-19 in early March, there was overwhelming support for our health care workers. As we enter flu season and COVID-19 infections continue to rise, including of my home state of Indiana, there is a heightened need for 24-hour care availability for patients.

While frontline and essential workers in all industries face risks as they work to keep the country running in the face of a global pandemic, shift-work fatigue is an invisible risk they face.

Fatigue is a public health problem on a local and global scale. Humans are the only species that pretend to be nocturnal, but willpower cannot overcome biology.

There are many risks involved with fighting the need for sleep, including impaired reaction time, judgment and vision, problems with information processing and short-term memory, decreased performance, vigilance and motivation and increased moodiness and aggressive behaviors.

Nationwide, 16% of wage and salary employees follow shift-work schedules outside of the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., including 10% who work evening shifts or night shifts. More than 43% of workers are sleep-deprived, and those most at risk work the night shift, long shifts or irregular shifts.

Furthermore, fatigue is estimated to cost employers $136 billion a year in health-related productivity. While there is no perfect solution for night-shift work, meaningful steps can be taken to improve the impacts related to shift-worker sleep and fatigue.

COVID-19:In midst of coronavirus pandemic, rural America desperately needs more doctors like me

In general, employees receive little education on the importance of sleep and sleep disorders and the consequences of fatigue. And while night-shift work is necessary in many industries, there is a growing body of evidence that its negative impacts can be mitigated through onboarding education, science-based scheduling and rostering, and increased recognition of the added burden shift work places on employees.

Employers are in a unique position to educate employees on how to avoid fatigue-related safety incidents. These strategies can help this nocturnal workforce mitigate their inherent risk, improve their quality of life and increase productivity in the workplace.

The pandemic has layered an additional burden on shift workers with the loss of child care, remote learning for their children (most of which is scheduled during the daytime hours), and the loss of an already limited social life.

Health care workers have to care for themselves first

Working in hospitals and health care facilities creates an increased chance that friends and colleagues become sick and must isolate themselves, which also creates additional emotional challenges for an already stressful line of work.

If one good thing has come of COVID-19, it’s that the pandemic has made employers think more carefully about mental health resources for their employees and learn to be more accepting of the mental-health burden that goes alongside night-shift work.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan:Supreme Court can root out Philadelphia's anti-Catholic bigotry

While fatigue impacts workers across sectors, it’s particularly important for health care workers who cannot properly care for patients if their own needs aren’t met first.

Their self-care must be prioritized and supported by family, friends, neighbors and peers. I encourage anyone who knows someone in the health care industry to remind them to take time for themselves and even lend a helping hand.

One small but mighty way to honor the important and often unrecognized contributions of night-shift nurses and shift workers is to thank those who had to work an extra hour during their normal shift due to the daylight-saving time change on Nov. 1.

This is one reason why Western Governors University Indiana launched its Night Shift Nurses campaign, which will deliver 1,900 appreciation kits to night shift workers at health care facilities statewide this year.

We must remain aware of the sacrifices of those on the front lines and learn how we can best help them care for themselves so they can care for the most vulnerable.

At this critical time, I am urging employers and communities to prioritize health care workers’ sleep health through education, resources and self-care.

But liberals didn't get off scot-free, either.","As the highbrow writers were publishing their somber tome about American decline and the collapsing temple of Pax Americana, the sun came out on Wednesday morning.

Moderates in the suburbs of Phoenix and Atlanta, who had given Donald Trump a test drive in the fall of 2016, decided they were ready to turn him back in.

Four years ago, Trump promised he would grow into the job of commander in chief. “At the right time, I will be so presidential, you will be so bored.”

In the early morning hours of Wednesday it was plainly obvious what had been plainly obvious these past four years: Trump will never grow up.

The race for president remains in question, but it is inching slowly toward victory for Democrat Joe Biden. Trump tried to pre-empt that by declaring victory and accusing the Democrats of election fraud.

Finally, voters began restoring order

But even conservatives saw that for what it was — a farce and an outrage.

“No, Trump has not already won the election, and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has,” tweeted Ben Shapiro.

“I was very distressed by what I just heard the president say,” former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum told CNN.

The American project is banged up, but on Tuesday the people of this country began restoring order by delivering divided government. They are putting an adult back in the White House, with a Senate that will check against his party’s worst excesses.

There will be no packing of the Supreme Court, no adding states to pack the U.S. Senate, no blowing up the legislative filibuster.

And the Green New Deal is today the Green Pipe Dream.

Election 2020: A referendum on Trump

The country is showing the door to a chief executive who shook the table of establishment Washington, but lacked the emotional maturity to hold the job.

Donald Trump is his own worst enemy, and it is easy to see that if Trump could have bridled his many terrible impulses, he probably would have easily won re-election.

Election 2020 was a referendum on Donald Trump. He was all of the electricity in the campaign and the most interesting presence on our TV screens.

Election 2020:Trump's huge vote total breaks my heart. I recognize this America and I wish I did not.

In New York Times exit polls, 75% of those who said they voted not for their candidate but mainly “against his opponent” were Democrats.

I’ve spent four years trying to understand Trump and have decided he has one virtue. He is courageous. He has pushed against powerful headwinds in the popular culture that are almost entirely liberal.

The left controls the major echo chambers in academia, national media, entertainment, Big Tech, the Washington bureaucracy. They hate Trump and actively fought against his challenge to the D.C. establishment.

But the left is not without sin

And they are not without sin, their greatest being their lack of introspection — their inability to understand how their own dysfunction contributed to the broken state of our country.

National media long ago stopped trying to be objective chroniclers of news and became instead partisans in a 24/7/365 campaign for the hearts and minds of Americans. To read the national newspapers is to read a daily screed against conservatism and a daily celebration of leftist ideals.

Election results:Vote challenger chaos in Detroit was white privilege on steroids

Sorry, but reality doesn’t lay clean like that.

News reporters who are supposed to maintain critical distance from their subjects are routinely trolling conservative politicians on Twitter.

And what of all their published polls this election season that greatly overstated Biden’s strength, emboldening Democrats and demoralizing Republicans? Four years ago the pollsters got it wrong. They had four years to fix their models. This year they got it even more wrong.

Our universities are no different. They are bubbles of like-minded intolerants who would rather advocate for causes than explore truth. There is no contest of ideas because there are no competing ideas. It’s all one big happy herd of sheep.

While they rail against the authoritarianism of Donald Trump, they have become gulags of censorship. They’re as great a threat to western ideals as the man-child in the White House.

Close races in swing states and President Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud have created widespread anxiety and a general acceptance that America is more divided than ever. But polarization is a political tactic that has long been deployed by people who do not want change in America’s political and economic system.

Yes, division is real. But Americans are incredibly united in an understanding that our system is not working for most of us. Despite deep political divisions, fighting poverty is a struggle that unites most Americans.

As billionaires have watched their wealth grow exponentially during the coronavirus pandemic, most Americans have struggled to make ends meet while caring for children at home, finding PPE to keep themselves safe and wondering why their government cannot pass a relief bill. Some of the benefits in the initial COVID relief bill helped the wealthiest Americans. Though people did receive one-time checks from the government, that money was spent long before tens of millions of Americans were able to get back to work.

This year's economic crisis has served to highlight the extreme inequality that the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has sought to address since our launch in 2018. Before we organized coordinating committees in 43 states, we worked with some of the best economists to understand why, in the wealthiest nation in the world, there was not a single county in the country where someone working full-time and earning minimum wage could afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment.

When we looked closely at the economic reality for everyday Americans, we found that 140 million people were either poor or low income, just one emergency away from not being able to make it.

The coronavirus pandemic has not impacted all Americans equally. According to an analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, poor people are three times as likely to contract COVID-19. And when they do, they and their families are not able to quarantine and skip work. Poverty has not only made the pandemic worse for poor people; it has fueled our public health crisis as many service workers have continued to show up for work, even when they suspect they may be infected with the virus, because they have no other way to survive.

In the face of this painful reality, Americans increasingly support policies that address poverty. Support has increased especially among Republicans, who have historically been less supportive of such proposals. Take living wages, for example. More than 70% of Americans support raising the minimum wage, according to an Ipsos poll. Before the pandemic, only 48% of Republicans backed this anti-poverty measure. But in late August, 62% of Republicans said they supported raising the minimum wage.

Universal access to health care is another anti-poverty measure that a growing majority of Americans support. Despite the Trump administration’s attacks on the Affordable Care Act, its expansion of health care to 25 million Americans continues to remain popular. Ahead of this year’s election, 63% of Americans said that the government has a responsibility to make sure everyone has access to health care — a four percentage point increase since last year. When asked if the government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, even a majority of Republicans agree.

No doubt, this year’s election has highlighted deep divisions in our common life, many of which are regularly exploited by the wealthy few.

But this is not new. The long story of inequality in America is that race, politics and cultural wedge issues have been deployed consistently to divide and conquer coalitions of Native, Black, white, brown and Asian Americans who have pushed this nation to guarantee equal treatment under the law and an economy that works for everyone.

Those wounds don’t go away when we commit to tackle poverty, but there is promise that they can heal when we recognize that some things are not about left or right, but about right vs wrong. It’s wrong that nearly half of citizens of the richest nation in the world struggle to make ends meet.

Ending poverty is a moral issue that can and must unite us all.

Opinion contributor

I take pride in trying to be a good anesthesiologist, but that hasn’t helped much in keeping my family from being devastated by a rare genetic disease called Vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (VEDS). So far, I have lost my dad, all three of my brothers and a nephew to this disease. Unless something changes, there will likely be more.

My dad died suddenly at age 48 in 1989, ultimately from a ruptured hepatic artery. None of us knew why it happened, nor that it was only the beginning.

In 2004, my brother, Steve, was diagnosed with an aneurysm in his iliac artery due to VEDS, for the first time putting a name to a disease we now wish we’d never heard of. He underwent elective open repair in 2006 at age 40 and died after the operation of multiple bleeding complications. Four years later, my brother, Tom, died at 42, from a perforated heart ventricle after a minor heart procedure.

My brother Mike knew he had it for a while. We were friends, like all my brothers, and we talked often about hope and living life fully. Frankly, by now, I was afraid every time I saw his cell number pop up. In 2013, I got the call I had been dreading when he died of a coronary rupture at 49. Later that year, Mike’s apparently healthy son Chris, 25, died suddenly, following a renal artery rupture.

Living fearlessly

Cruelly, VEDS is far from done with our family. VEDS patients are prone to artery ruptures anywhere in the body, including the aorta, rupture of hollow organs like the intestines and uterus, and lung collapse. Though it’s very rare, it affects 50% of offspring, and patients’ median lifespan is about 48 years. We have already had at least two additional diagnoses, and our family is far from alone. An estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans have this disease.

As for me, I ran from the diagnosis for years. I did not want to give up hope that I could avoid the anguish that I had seen my brothers experience while living with the knowledge that they were essentially time bombs. Yet somehow, they still managed to live daily life fearlessly. Meeting them, you might never have known that they had a lethal disease.

Lately, COVID-19 has shown us all what it’s like to live with fear, something that the VEDS community already knows all too well. Facing your own mortality daily is tough. If you’re not careful, it can make you hard and unyielding, but it can also free you from insignificant concerns so you can better be the person you’d like be.

It also means you may face impossible decisions. In our family, none of us knew about VEDS until we were already married and had kids, but I can’t imagine having to choose between never having the blessing of my kids and passing this cruel disease on to them. My niece Emma recently married the special kind of person it takes to choose to face these fears and uncertainties together.

College student:I was in quarantine on campus. They gave me a bag lunch and little help.

I’ve learned fearless doesn’t necessarily mean “not afraid.” It may just mean being a little better at being intentional, present, positive, and above all, loving, so there isn’t much room left for fear. I think I would be happy if, when something happens to me, people said they didn’t know anything was wrong.

Hope for a cure

Candidly, I haven’t shared my diagnosis freely because I don’t want VEDS to be my identity. I’d rather people see me first as a family man, a good friend, and a physician. But, frustratingly, for all those living, and dying, with VEDS, there is currently no real effective treatment and thus little hope. I’m hoping that sharing my story now can spur a call to action.

There is a small group of excellent clinicians and researchers in this field, but hope for a cure is really at the ground floor. In the meantime, we badly need energy, expertise, and resources towards the basics: research, registries, drug development, and especially drug trials.

These challenges are daunting and, of course, much depends on funding. The obvious reality is that properly resourcing these initiatives is a very expensive proposition, especially for such a small community of patients.

Thankfully, other rare diseases like Cystic Fibrosis have captured public attention. While few have heard of VEDS, we similarly need to make it a household word. We are already working on educating patients and their families, and we need to continue to engage physicians; early awareness of the emergent implications of VEDS is critical, along with better surveillance and lifestyle recommendations.

Tom Nichols:The only bright spot in Trump's Soviet-style COVID-19 strategy is that it's not working

The next critical step is fostering greater public awareness and stimulating public and private support. My hope is that making you aware of VEDS today moves the effort forward.

What really fuels us is hope. Clinicians, researchers, and advocates are indeed beginning to bring the resources they have together, giving us some hope. And hope, measured simply for us by another year of life, provides a reason to fight. Clearly, we can’t do it alone; we have made a start, but have a long road to travel. We need people to fearlessly travel that road with us.

You'd think Trump would want to be on his best behavior to woo the few remaining undecided voters.

More than any other politician, Trump has weaponized the social media platform, using it as a club to attack everyone from his fellow politicians to Hollywood actors, rapper Snoop Dogg, journalists, professional athletes and his opponent's son, Hunter Biden.

It must be infuriating for Trump that the senior Biden hasn't taken the bait in recent weeks, largely ignoring the president's broadsides on social media as the Democratic front-runner tries to make himself look presidential. Biden's no saint, on or off Twitter, but Trump's incessant barrage of ugly tweets got old a long time ago.

Opinion contributor

Kamala Harris walked onto the stage atop a Wilmington, Delaware, riverfront parking lot Saturday night as the opening act to the speech President-elect Joe Biden would give to a nation that had just handed him the keys to the Oval Office.

Her job was to warm up the hundreds of people assembled before her in socially distanced vehicles and the millions more who watched on television — but not to upstage Biden, whose masterful White House campaign consigned President Donald Trump to the ignominy of a one-term president who in two tries couldn’t win a majority of the votes cast by the American people.

Yet Harris got my attention in ways that Biden’s powerful words of national reconciliation did not. It happened in a section of her remarks that began with praise for her mother, an Indian immigrant who was a brilliant cancer researcher and foot soldier of this country’s civil rights movement. Shyamala Gopalan Harris “believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible,” Harris said. “And so, I’m thinking about her and about the generations of women — Black women, Asian, White, Latina, Native American women who throughout our nation’s history have paved the way for this moment tonight.”

Smashing a glass ceiling for women

And in that moment — with those words — Harris became the evening’s main attraction for millions of women all over the world.

Kanan Lauzon, a 38-year-old mother of two, is the daughter of Indian immigrants who came to the United States in 1970. Shortly before Harris spoke Saturday, Lauzon, a talent acquisition manager for a defense contractor, told me of the connection she feels to the vice president-elect. “This is really very uplifting for me,” Lauzon said. “It shows that a woman of Asian descent has broken an important glass ceiling.”

Neera Tanden:Like Kamala Harris, I'm the daughter of an Indian immigrant. We are the American story

Lauzon isn’t unmindful of Harris' public embrace of her African American roots. A lot has been said about the pride Harris takes in Howard University, the historically Black higher education institution she attended, and about her membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, this nation’s oldest Black sorority. Lauzon respects that part of Harris’ heritage. She just claims the part of Harris — her Indian heritage — in which she also takes great pride.

“I really want my daughters (ages 4 and 2) to see her up close. I would love to take them to the inauguration,” she said, as her husband, Brad, looked on with a warm smile. “It would be amazing for them to be a part of that moment.”

It’s a moment that I sensed was coming, 10 years ago.

Shortly after Harris was elected California’s attorney general, in 2010, I interviewed her about that big political achievement. In winning that job, Harris became the first woman and the first person who identified as African American to become the chief legal officer for this nation’s most populous state

What Harris was destined to be

Just about anyone who wins a statewide election in California gets a fast pass into the Washington political arena, though that is hardly an assurance of continued success. When I suggested to Harris that her new job and résumé — she was a civil rights activist and a prosecutor who pushed job training for nonviolent offenders and rehabilitation for ex-offenders — could take her far in Washington, she rejected my suggestion that she could be a new breed of national leader.

“I hope to serve this nation as the attorney general of California,” Harris told me. “I believe in that old adage that ‘as goes California, so goes the country.’ ”

To prepare for that state job, Harris assembled a transition team that was headed by two former U.S. secretaries of State — Republican George Shultz and Democrat Warren Christopher. “I wanted to have people who understand California in the context of the globe,” she explained.

Qualified and energizing:Joe Biden's VP choice of Kamala Harris signals return to American values and competence

All of this caused me to say in a December 2010 column that while Harris was “too smart to acknowledge that her sights are set on anything other than the job she’s about to take on,"" she was ""destined to become a commanding presence in the political life of this country.”

What I couldn’t predict was just how much she would touch the life of Asian Americans like Kanan Lauzon, as well as the many women who find in her a piece of their own identity — and the inspiration to imagine new possibilities for themselves and their children.

Opinion contributor

For almost eight years, I was a prosecutor in Baltimore. I worked with police, victims and witnesses to enforce a system of laws I believed protected people from violence. Or, provided justice and closure to victims and their families. Naively, I included myself, a Black woman, in the group of persons I believed the law protected.

I have always known, intellectually, that the American legal system was built upon the inhumane enslavement of people of African descent, and that policing was the result of efforts to maintain chattel slavery. But working through that history — from slavery to modern-day crime — involves dismantling entrenched narratives. For example, narratives asserting that our criminal justice system now works to protect all people, equally. In reality, the American legal system has repeatedly failed to protect Black women. It has failed to hold accountable those responsible for causing our bodily harm and death.

On Sept. 15, 1963, four Black girls — Addie Mae Collins, 14, Cynthia Wesley, 14, Carole Robertson, 14, and Denise McNair, 11 — were murdered when a bomb exploded in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. A known member of the Ku Klux Klan, Robert Chambliss, was charged with the murders and buying dynamite, but he was initially convicted only of possession of dynamite without a permit. It wasn't until 1977 that he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.

On March 13, police in Louisville, Kentucky, entered a home to execute a search warrant. During the execution of the warrant, police fired more than 20 rounds, killing Breonna Taylor, a Black woman not named in the warrant. The grand jury indicted one officer for wanton endangerment for shots fired into an adjacent apartment where property damage occurred. Recently, it was revealed that the state attorney general declined to present homicide charges against the officers. Jurors have publicly disclosed that they felt there was sufficient evidence to pursue more serious charges, but that the prosecutor denied them the option to do so.

COLUMN:Protections for voters have expired; keep police away from polls

At two critical periods of racial unrest, this system found criminality in the possession of dynamite and the firing of bullets that damaged property, yet failed to find any wrongdoing in the killing of four Black girls and one Black woman. With 57 years separating these incidents, the narrative remains glaringly clear: Misdemeanor offenses have a higher priority in the American criminal justice system than the bodies and lives of Black women and girls.

Law practitioners and scholars are gatekeepers of the legal profession — a profession that aims to uphold the rule of law and promote justice. As a law professor, I consider it a privilege to influence the next generation of lawyers.

However, as a Black female law professor, I find myself vacillating between two realities. First, recognizing that our legal system was built on the dehumanization of an entire race, making it incapable of ever achieving its true potential. Second, appreciating the brilliance and ingenuity of the American rule of law, and believing that if implemented with care, it can do more good than harm.

COLUMN:To our next president: 10 priorities for fixing our justice system

But there is another more insidious issue that I face. Dealing with the trope of the strong Black woman. It pervasively insists that Black women are able to withstand pain, turmoil and danger — while masterfully accomplishing a multitude of professional tasks.

Black women in law work to maintain a legal system that offers no justice for the Black women wrongfully killed by police. Lawyers take an oath to uphold the Constitution. But the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause has been denied to Black women like Taylor and many more — including Sandra Bland, found dead in a Texas jailhouse three days after a confrontational traffic stop by a white state trooper in 2015. Black women in law devote their lives to a system that seemingly provides nothing in return.

This year, I have questioned how I can teach my students to implement the laws of a system that consistently and blatantly fails to protect the lives of Black women. In the classroom, denying this failure furthers the stereotypes that Black women’s pain, suffering and lives do not matter. If I do not explicitly acknowledge my own humanity, I cannot expect a system that has repeatedly failed Black women to do so.

POLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media

After it was announced that there would be no indictment for Breonna Taylor’s killing, I made the following statement to my students. I was raw and exposed. But my choice to be vulnerable in the moment was incredibly empowering and healing.

“Today, I will teach and I hope you will learn. But please do not misinterpret my choice to proceed with the task at hand as evidence of strength. Today, I will teach you from a place of weakness. Black women are not impenetrable. Black women do not possess super powers. Black women are not magic. We are human. Breonna Taylor was human, and her life, stolen without impunity, mattered.

""My heart is shattered. I am hurting and broken. But my coping mechanism is speaking truth to power. I choose to not squander the enormous privilege I have as a lawyer and teacher of the law. So, I will teach you well. I will write. I will speak. I will advocate. But I will also grieve and I will rest. I will take care of myself. I will give myself permission to be human.

""Because the law consistently fails to protect Black women, this is truly the only way for me to ensure that my life matters.”

Black scholar-activists like Audre Lorde have long asserted the importance of radical self-care. Black women in law must embrace this practice as the next phase of the movement. Vulnerability is a powerful tool in the fight for justice. Eliminating the burden of responsibility to repair this flawed criminal justice system is critical in deconstructing the harmful narrative of Black woman as fixer.

Engaging in self-care reinforces our humanity and sends a clear message that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves to repair a system we did not break. Because our lives — and not just our work — matter.

Opinion contributor

On Saturday night, President-elect Joe Biden pledged to unite America and to close the gaping wounds left by President Donald Trump.

""It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again,"" Biden urged, after vote counts in Pennsylvania and Nevada sealed his victory. ""This is the time to heal in America.""

Yet, America will almost certainly emerge embittered and divided from this election cycle. And healing it will require changes in education, not just in leadership.

Put simply, our schools and universities must teach a more informed and mutually tolerant style of citizenship than we have displayed over the past four years.

I’m looking at you, dear reader. How many times have you “liked” or forwarded a tweet or a Facebook post, even though you knew it might not be factually accurate? And how often have you denounced other Americans as “wingnuts,” “libtards,” or any of the other slurs that we use to denigrate those who disagree with us?

All of that was accelerated by President Donald Trump, of course, but he didn’t invent it. And the rest of us have played along, to varying degrees, imitating Trump’s ignorant and belligerent style even when we claimed to revile him.

The only way that ends is to teach a better way in our classrooms. That’s where we learn — or should learn — how to separate fact from opinion, and credible information from propaganda. When untold numbers of Americans think that members of their government are operating a secret pedophile ring and drinking the blood of murdered victims, something has gone terribly wrong in our educational system.

And QAnon is only the tip of the disinformation iceberg, of course. As the pandemic has demonstrated, millions of people believe half-baked conspiracy theories about COVID-19 over the statements of credentialed scientists. Trump has endorsed some of the wackiest coronavirus claims, but we can't lay all the blame on him. Many citizens are simply unequipped to judge them fairly and accurately.

In an evaluation last year of more than 3,000 high school students in 14 states, researchers at Stanford found that two-thirds could not tell the difference between news stories and sponsored advertisements. And just 4% of students recognized that the sponsorship of a climate-change website by the fossil fuel industry might lessen its credibility.

Climate-change denial is rampant among Republicans, whose leadership has consistently cast doubt upon the fact that human activity is a major factor in warming the earth. But in a 2019 poll, 15% of liberal Democrats and 35% of moderate ones rejected it as well.

Likewise, 17% of Democrats — alongside 40% of Republicans — have already declared that they’re unlikely to get a vaccine against coronavirus when it becomes available. Until we teach people how to distinguish between real medical information and the false kind, millions of Americans will remain at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths.

Educators should model respect

Most of all, we need our schools and universities to model the mutual respect and restraint that America jettisoned during the Trump presidency. On our airwaves, talking heads shout past each other in a 24/7 tsunami of snark and invective. Social media is even worse, freeing us to smear our fellow citizens with impunity.

Our educational institutions should be teaching a different — and better — form of behavior. Too often, they don’t. Teachers in K-12 classrooms frequently steer away from controversial topics, so students don't learn how to address these subjects in a civil and constructive manner. And at our colleges, students across the political spectrum report that they censor their own views to avoid getting “canceled” by others.

Students self censor views

In a recent survey of 22,000 students at 55 colleges and universities, 75 percent of “strong Republicans” and 52 percent of “strong Democrats” said they kept quiet for fear of provoking the wrath of other students or faculty members.

And with good reason. At my own institution, I’ve heard several professors say they won’t allow anyone in their class to speak favorably about Donald Trump because other students might feel threatened.

That echoes Trump’s own divisive rhetoric, of course, and it delays the real educational healing that must happen.

Joe Biden will surely exhibit a more informed, inclusive style of leadership than Donald Trump did. But it won't make a difference unless our teachers do the same thing. The road to repairing America starts in the schoolhouse, not the White House.

Opinion contributor

The latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act comes this week under increasingly precarious circumstances: A Supreme Court on which Justice Amy Coney Barrett has succeeded the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and an election that ended with Democratic control of the Senate hinging on two long-odds January run-offs in Georgia.

If the Supreme Court strikes down the health law and Republicans continue to hold the Senate, a splintered Congress probably won’t be able to agree on a replacement. And the consequences of that would be dire. Ripping away the law would pitch almost 23 million people off their insurance, shred protections for people with preexisting conditions, and throw the health care system into chaos.

As the court hears arguments Tuesday and considers the case, it would do well to remember what former Secretary of State Colin Powell and others used to call the Pottery Barn rule: You break it, you own it.

Health law is in real jeopardy

Dreamed up by Republican attorneys general looking to burnish their conservative credentials, this case is laughably weak. In late 2017, after congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they targeted the most unpopular part of the law: the individual mandate that required people to have insurance or pay a penalty. As part of their big tax bill, Republicans eliminated the tax penalty for going without insurance.

Ever since, President Donald Trump has crowed that “I got rid of the individual mandate.” And he’s right: By stripping out the penalty, Republicans neutered the mandate.

But the red-state challengers see things differently. When Republicans zeroed out the penalty, they didn’t formally repeal the law's (completely unenforceable) instruction that people “shall” buy insurance. The red states now argue that the toothless instruction is a coercive command — so coercive that it’s unconstitutional. Indeed, they go further. They insist that the unconstitutionality of this one provision means that all the rest of the Affordable Care Act is invalid, too.

The argument has been met with derision from legal commentators, conservatives and liberals alike. So far, however, it’s found support where it counts. The three Republican-appointed judges who heard the case in the lower courts have ruled for the red states. Even President Trump’s Justice Department, which normally defends the laws passed by Congress, has sided with the challengers.

The case is a long shot at the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts has already rejected two much stronger challenges to the law. And Justice Brett Kavanaugh has written at length about the need to be cautious about invalidating more of a law than strictly necessary. If those conservative jurists join with the three liberal justices, the lawsuit won’t go anywhere. But it’s hard to predict what the justices will think. The Affordable Care Act is in real jeopardy.

ACA and the Supreme Court:I’m a cancer survivor, but I might not survive Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court

While a ruling won't come until next year, don’t count on an incoming President Joe Biden to save the day. His Justice Department will surely withdraw its support for the lawsuit, but that won’t kill the case. The red states will keep pushing forward on their own.

In theory, Congress could pass a one-sentence law to kill the lawsuit, either by eliminating the language telling people to buy insurance or by increasing the penalty to a nominal amount (say, $1). Control of the Senate, however, is on a knife’s edge. Unless Democrats pick up both Georgia seats in January, they won’t have the votes to save the Affordable Care Act.

So whatever the Supreme Court does, it’s likely to stick.

The danger in breaking ACA

It’s hard to overstate how disruptive striking down the law would be. The Medicaid expansion, which covers 12 million poor people in 33 states, would evaporate. Healthcare.gov would go dark. Federal subsidies that keep coverage affordable would vanish. Most of the 10.7 million people who bought insurance on the exchanges would see their costs skyrocket, forcing millions to drop coverage.

Overnight, we’d be back in a world where insurers could — and would — refuse to cover people with preexisting conditions. Many will just exit the chaotic individual insurance market altogether, leaving people with few or no choices at all.

Medicare would suffer too. The Part D coverage gap on prescriptions (the ""donut hole"") would reopen, exposing seniors to larger out-of-pocket costs for their medications. Certain preventive benefits, including cancer screenings, would no longer be covered cost-free. Complex payment rules that depend on the Affordable Care Act would have to be changed on the fly, creating confusion and delays.

Tortured interpretation:Why is Trump trying to kill the Affordable Care Act as COVID-19 spikes across America?

No matter how bad it gets, however, a dysfunctional Congress probably would not stop the bleeding. Republicans can’t unite around a plan, as they proved in 2017 when they tried and failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. We’ve waited for four years for President Trump to unveil his “beautiful” plan.

If Republicans continue to control the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might choose to sit on his hands, hoping to wound Biden early in his presidency. The end result would be devastating for millions of people, the health care system and the economy. Our broken political system, however, won’t do a thing to help.

The Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect. But it’s the only option right now for securing coverage for nearly every American, however healthy or sick, rich or poor. If the Supreme Court breaks it, we’re all going to own it.

Although the streaming service has plenty of original series and makes network series from ABC, NBC and Fox available the day after they air on TV, there is more to its library of TV shows. The streamer has golden oldies (""The Golden Girls""), modern classics (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and reality gems (""Top Chef""), among many other choices.

There is so much good TV on Hulu, in fact, it can be hard to find the right show to watch at any given moment or keep track of what's still on the service, and what might be gone.

To help your binge-watching, we have curated the best of the TV shows Hulu has available to stream as of November 2020 (in alphabetical order).

Don't have Hulu? 50 best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now

Or maybe you prefer Amazon:The 50 best TV shows now streaming on Prime

1. “30 Rock”

Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan make an endlessly appealing trio in this award-winning series about NBC's ""Saturday Night Live""-style sketch comedy series. The original is almost enough to make you forget the recent infomercial the cast did for NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, Peacock.

2. “Atlanta”

Donald Glover’s audacious FX series about a college-dropout father trying to climb the economic ladder as a manager for his rapper cousin (Brian Tyree Henry) is proof of the multi-talented artist's creative prowess.

3. “Black-ish”

The ABC series follows an upper-middle-class Black family in a predominantly white Los Angeles neighborhood, as it navigates social issues. With great performances by Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross, it's one of the best sitcoms on TV.

4. ""Bob's Burgers""

Fox's adult animated comedy isn't just another ""Simpsons"" or ""Family Guy"" copycat. Rather than mining the bleakest parts of modern life for laughs, creator Loren Bouchard instead made a sitcom that is sweet, silly and absurdly happy, full of original songs and nonsensical plots and burger creations.

5. “Broad City”

This millennials-in-New-York Comedy Central series is both outlandish in its humor (drug-fueled trips to Whole Foods, children who shout “Yas, queen!”) and relatable (bad roommates, bad boyfriends). Stars/creators Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer bring their kooky world to life expertly.

6. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”

From the producer of ""Parks and Recreation” and “The Good Place, Fox's (and now NBC's) workplace comedy, set in a New York police precinct, also masters fast-paced humor and an upbeat tone.

7. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”

Witty, funny, thrilling and occasionally heart breaking, WB's seminal fantasy series about a high school girl on a mission to save the world is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it. And maybe those of us who already have.

8. “Cheers”

With a superb cast (Ted Danson forever!), smart humor and a nostalgic setting, NBC's classic sitcom set in a Boston bar still holds up after all these years.

9. “Community”

This slightly zany NBC comedy about a group of diverse friends attending a local community college has its ups and downs, but its funniest, most ambitious installments are among the best TV episodes ever made. The last few seasons don’t quite live up to the sharp first three.

10. “Don’t Trust the B---- in Apt 23”

This quirky series about a nightmare roommate didn't last long on ABC, but made great comedy, with Krysten Ritter and James Van Der Beek, who played a fictional version of himself.

11. “ER”

Before ""Grey’s Anatomy"" treated us to soapy hospital drama, NBC's huge hit was set in an emergency room. From the George Clooney days to its final few seasons, the series always knew how to balance tragedy with heartwarming elements.

12. “Fargo”

FX's superb anthology crime series, based on the Coen Brothers movie, captures the spirit of the film in its distinctive seasons. Each installment is so good and so tonally resonant it’s hard to pick a favorite (nope, just kidding, it's Season 2).

13. “Firefly”

Fox's “Firefly” gave us only 13 episodes and one box-office-bomb feature film, but this space Western starring Nathan Fillion is stunning.

14. “Frasier”

If “Cheers” isn’t enough for you, try this slightly more cynical and mature NBC sitcom about Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), one of the most successful spin-offs of all time.

15. “Fresh Off the Boat”

From the creator of “Don’t Trust the B----” comes another Hall of Fame ABC family sitcom. Especially in the first four seasons, this story of a Taiwanese American family in 1990s Orlando, Florida, was full of great, specific humor and a talented cast, including Constance Wu and Randall Park.

16. “Friday Night Lights”

The drama on NBC's acclaimed high school football series undeniably makes it one of the best shows to binge-watch, equally entertaining for teens and adults.

17. “The Golden Girls”

They don't make them like they used to, right? A visit from Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia is always funny and calming, no matter whether you're just discovering the beloved NBC sitcom, or rewatching it.

18. “The Great”

Hulu’s original series about Russia’s Catherine the Great (Elle Fanning) was a delight when it premiered last spring, a farcical royal romp from the writer of Oscar-winner “The Favourite.”

19. “Happy Endings”

One of the many ""Friends""-like hangout sitcoms to emerge over the past two decades, ABC's ""Endings"" is on the quirkier, more heightened side, following five thirtysomethings in Chicago.

20. “High Fidelity”

Zoe Kravitz is an appealing rom-com lead in this gender-flipped take on the Nick Hornby novel. The Hulu original series subverts many cheesy tropes of the genre, while respecting what makes a romance so appealing.

21. ""Hill Street Blues""

The 1980s NBC police drama from Steven Bochco was critically beloved and a multiple-Emmy winner because it pushed the police procedural genre to a new level of intricacy and gravitas.

22. “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”

If you enjoy a certain brand of crass, cringe comedy, more than 150 episodes of this long-running FX lovingly poke fun at Philly (and Danny DeVito), with a lot of mishaps along the way.

23. “Justified”

Timothy Olyphant is at his absolute best in FX's cowboy tale of a U.S. Marshal with his own code of justice and deep ties to criminals in his small Kentucky town.

24. “Key & Peele”

If you're more interested in morsels of laughter than long narratives, this Comedy Central sketch show, which jumpstarted the careers of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, is perfect, and requires very little commitment to get big laughs.

25. “Killing Eve”

Sandra Oh and Emmy-winner Jodie Comer are a delectable cat and mouse duo in BBC America's crime drama about a sociopathic assassin (Comer) and the intelligence agent (Oh) hunting her down. Season 3 (arriving Nov. 6), while not as good as the first two, still has plenty of assassin action.

26. “Living Single”

Queen Latifah and Kim Coles are among the bright young stars in this rollicking twenty-something 1990s Fox sitcom about, well, singles living in Brooklyn.

27. “Lodge 49”

Lost underachiever Dud (Wyatt Russell) finds purpose at a dusty fraternal order in this AMC dramedy. Sunny, relaxing and sweet, “Lodge” may be the chillest show around.

28. “Lost”

We have to go back ... to ABC's 2004-10 mystical drama. It inspired endless copycat series (“The Event,” “Manifest,” “Revolution,” “Terra Nova”), but nothing beats the story of airplane crash survivors on a mysterious island.

29. “M*A*S*H*”

The CBS smash set at an army hospital during the Korean War lasted far longer than that conflict because it was just too wonderful to take off the air. A classic for a reason, the series is funny, smart and full of wonderful actors at their best, including Alan Alda, Mike Farrell and Loretta Swit.

30. “Mrs. America”

FX's historical drama, depicting the fight for and against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, has a cast so talented it's embarrassing. Cate Blanchett, Rose Byrne, Uzo Aduba, Margo Martindale and Sarah Paulson bring the ERA era to life, helped by sharp scripts and gorgeous costuming.

31. “Normal People”

Hulu’s romantic drama captivated quarantined hearts and minds when it premiered last spring, for good reason. The adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel, starring appealing young actors Daisy Edgar-Jones and Emmy-nominated Paul Mescal, tells the story of life and love in an achingly normal way.

32. “Party Down”

Fans of “Veronica Mars” and “iZombie” will love this cynical Starz comedy about bowtie-sporting cater-waiters that stars Jane Lynch and Adam Scott.

33. “PEN15”

A certain swath of millennials can appreciate how, with painstaking accuracy, creator/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle re-created the middle school experience of 2000 in all its awkward glory. Hulu's cheekily named original comedy is so cringe-y you might implode from embarrassment, but it’s hilarious in equal measure. Season 2 arrives Sept. 18.

34. “Ramy”

Creator/star Ramy Youssef’s original Hulu series is a brilliant work of art, telling the story of a Muslim man (Youssef) looking for love in New Jersey and caught between his faith and modern excesses.

35. “Saturday Night Live”

While you're waiting for new episodes from Season 46, you can dive into the 45 seasons of the NBC institution for some quick laughs and topical (well, at the time) parodies.

36. “Scrubs”

The sweet, silly comedy of NBC's (and later ABC's) long-running “Scrubs,” starring Zach Braff, Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke, is what we most often remember. But it's also a celebration of the doctors who work so hard to save lives, a more realistic look at life in the hospital than high-drama soap operas.

37. “Seinfeld”

If you've never seen Jerry Seinfeld's landmark NBC show about nothing, it's a great time to start. But you might want to skip the disappointing series finale. Or maybe you love it. We don’t judge.

38. “The Simpsons”

At a time when the quirky citizens of Springfield feel less odd than real life, Fox's (very) long-running adult animated comedy feels almost quaint in its rude humor and pop culture parodies. But it’s comforting and satisfying nonetheless.

39. “Speechless”

Gone too soon after just three seasons, ABC's comedy about a family in which one son has cerebral palsy is representation of disability you've never seen before, with searing satire and riotous humor.

40. “Star Trek” franchise

Whether you want to hang with Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), original bros Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) or travel to “Deep Space,” there’s a “Star Trek” series for every mood.

41. “Superstore”

This NBC series, about employees at a big box store, is something of a modern-day ""Cheers,"" a workplace comedy set outside a traditional white-collar office in a place we all have wandered into at some point. (The blue vests of the fictional Cloud 9 store might remind you of a certain retail chain).

42. “Survivor”

An oldie but goodie, CBS’s 20-years-and-counting reality competition series shows us the best (and, the worst) of human resilience.

43. “The Terror”

AMC’s anthology historical horror series (try saying that five times fast) beautifully brings its time periods to life: an Arctic expedition in the 1800s in Season 1 and World War II internment camps in America in Season 2. Smart, with superb casts (Jared Harris, Ciaran Hinds and George Takei), there’s nothing quite like it.

44. “Top Chef”

There are dozens of food shows and chef competitions, but this Bravo staple remains the best, pitting a group of chefs in a series of grueling competitions.

45. “Top of the Lake”

Starring Elisabeth Moss at her best (and eventually Nicole Kidman and Gwendoline Christie in Season 2), Jane Campion’s exquisite Sundance TV crime drama is about so much more than a detective on a case.

46. “The Twilight Zone”

Sometimes it feels like we’re living in the twilight zone, so it can be comforting to revisit the seminal mid-century CBS anthology series. Its science fiction stories are still sharp and clever, with twists that surprise, delight and horrify, from a woeful pair of glasses to an alien cookbook.

47. Twin Peaks

David Lynch’s eerie 1990s ABC crime drama was a ratings bonanza for a reason, even if it faded in a disappointing Season 2.It’s unlike anything that had been on television before, and still stands out among similar series that popped up in its wake.

48. “Veronica Mars”

Long before she was a singing princess, Kristen Bell was a teenage gumshoe in a toxic Southern California town. A superb modern noir, the original UPN series, fan-funded film and the Hulu revival are seedy, successful and satisfying.

49. “What We Do in the Shadows”

FX’s vampire comedy, based on the 2014 Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement film, is farce at its absolute best, putting its gothic vampires, a boring “energy vampire” and their belabored human “familiar” in a series of ever-escalating conundrums.

50. “The X-Files”

The recent Fox revival was mostly disappointing, but the original was groundbreaking, thrilling and eerie. If you're trying to fill up weeks of viewing, there are nine long seasons of Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigating the unknown."

Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — One of publishing's most thriving genres of the past four years, books about President Donald Trump, is not going to end when he leaves office.

In 2021 and beyond, look for waves of releases about the Trump administration and about the president's loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Works already planned include the anti-Trump ""Preventable: The Inside Story of How Leadership Failures, Politics, and Selfishness Doomed the U.S. Coronavirus Response,"" by former Obamacare head Andy Slavitt. There's a campaign book from New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns. And former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is reportedly working on a memoir.

Expect detailed condemnations of the 45th president's actions and rhetoric, from journalists and former associates, and also flattering accounts from White House allies and pro-Trump pundits. And there might well be a book from Trump himself, who received more than 70 million votes even as he became the first president in nearly 30 years to be defeated after one term.

""It was a very controversial presidency and the New York publishing world isn't exactly packed with Trump fans,"" says Matt Latimer of the Javelin literary agency, where clients have included former FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Fox host Tucker Carlson.

""But there are tens of millions of Americans who look to the Trump presidency as an important time and are fans of his administration. At least some publishers will recognize that.""

Publishers often speak proudly about their openness to diverse voices, while also acknowledging that they like to make money. Several houses have conservative imprints that over the past few years have acquired books by everyone from Sean Hannity to Corey Lewandowski.

Simon & Schuster is Hillary Clinton's longtime publisher, but through its conservative Threshold Editions released Trump's most recent work, ""Crippled America,"" which came out in 2015. Center Street, a Hachette Book Group imprint, has published Donald Trump Jr., Newt Gingrich and Judge Jeanine Pirro among others.

""No matter their political beliefs, every American has personally experienced the seismic shift within Washington,"" Center Street publisher Daisy Blackwell Hutton said in a statement. ""Books will be published for years to come about his presidency and the conservative movement in general, and Center Street absolutely intends to be a leader in that space.""

There are risks in publishing Trump, although even presidents who have left office highly unpopular, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, managed to get book deals and release bestsellers. None were as polarizing as Trump or have so many upcoming legal battles, including a New York State investigation into his finances, and a defamation lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll, one of more than 20 women who have alleged sexual assault or misconduct by Trump.

Several publishers told the AP that they don't believe Trump will have the same global appeal as former President Barack Obama, whose ""A Promised Land"" comes out next week. Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, agreed to a reported $65 million deal with Crown in 2017.

Any publisher signing with Trump or a top administration official might face the anger not just of Trump critics among the general public, but from within the industry. When Simon & Schuster signed up the far right journalist-commentator Milo Yiannopoulos in 2017, more than 100 authors publicly objected. (The publisher ended up dropping him amid allegations he approved of sex between men and young boys.) Hachette cancelled a memoir by Woody Allen, whose daughter Dylan Farrow has alleged he sexually abused her, after employees staged a walkout in protest. (Skyhorse Publishing later released the book).

Ellen Oh, an author of fantasy novels who co-founded the grassroots organization We Need Diverse Books, mentioned three of the most controversial Trump appointees: Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and senior advisor Stephen Miller. ""I would campaign hard against these three officials who have done the most damage under Trump,"" said Oh, who was among those who signed the Yiannapoulos letter.

David Drake, executive vice president and publisher of Crown, which will release Obama's memoir, declined comment on whether he would acquire a book by Trump or even meet with him. The executive vice president and publisher of Alfred A. Knopf, Reagan Arthur, doubted she would sign up Trump, but added that she would probably agree to meet with him, out of courtesy to a former president.

Dana Canedy, senior vice president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's namesake imprint, said any decision to work with Trump or those in his Cabinet would depend on what they were planning to say.

""I would apply the same rigorous approach to any meeting, with anyone, Democratic or Republican,"" she said. ""I would have to see whether there's an arc to the story, how deeply reported it would be, and that there would be fact-checking so we could be confident about it. And that's whether Joe Biden was coming to me or Donald Trump was coming to me.""

Canedy said she might be interested in a book from Trump about his influence on the Republican Party, which initially resisted his rise in 2016. She would want Trump, or any author, to be ""fair, balanced and honest,"" and have ""a level of insight and self-awareness.""

Asked if she believed Trump could meet those standards, Canedy said: ""I wouldn't know how to answer that, quite honestly.""

The switch from a Republican to a Democratic president also should result in a shift on best-seller lists. The past four years have seen a continuous run of anti-Trump blockbusters, including Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury,"" Comey's ""A Higher Loyalty,"" Mary Trump's ""Too Much and Never Enough,"" and Bob Woodward's ""Fear"" and ""Rage.""

The next four years should mark the dawn of books against Biden.

""It's historically been our experience that books coming from the right are more available and more popular when there is a Democratic presidency,"" says Adrian Zackheim, who runs the conservative Sentinel imprint at Penguin Random House and has published books by Mike Huckabee, Nikki Haley and Brian Kilmeade among others. ""That is pretty much a scientific fact."""

The network, home to seriesincluding ""Survivor"" and ""Big Brother,"" announced a new goal for its future series to have casts that are 50% Black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) starting with the 2021-2022 broadcast season.

This comes as the entertainment industry at large has vowed to make adjustments to its front-of-camera talent and behind-the-scenes staff in an effort to promote diversity. The nation experienced a racial reckoning this summer following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, after a white police officer knelt on his neck, and also the death of Breonna Taylor at the hand of police. These were the latest sets of protests in a long-fought movement for racial justice.

""The reality TV genre is an area that’s especially underrepresented, and needs to be more inclusive across development, casting, production and all phases of storytelling,” George Cheeks, president and chief executive officer for the CBS Entertainment Group, said in a statement. ""As we strive to improve all of these creative aspects, the commitments announced today are important first steps in sourcing new voices to create content and further expanding the diversity in our unscripted programming, as well as on our Network.""

CBS, the most-watched network, will also devote at least one-quarter of its yearly unscripted budget to projects created or co-created by BIPOC producers.

The network previously announced updates to its scripted programming in July. It said it would allocate at least 25% of its future script development budgets to BIPOC projects. It also set a writers' room target, planning to have these staffs be at a minimum 40% BIPOC starting with the 2021- 2022 broadcast TV season. This would rise to 50% the year after.

CBS Studios is also working with the NAACP on establishing a production venture and signed an exclusive deal with 21CP Solutions, a group focusing on police reform efforts in the U.S. that will advise the network on its police and legal dramas.

There's still a lot of work to do when it comes to proportionately representing people of color on TV, and particularly in powerful roles behind the camera, a new study shows. But there is clear progress being made: Black representation is growing on television.

That's what the second part of UCLA's study ""Hollywood Diversity: A Tale of Two Hollywoods,"" which focuses on TV, reported in a study published last month.

Although the study shows shows that Black characters have become better represented on TV, it points out that other minority groups are far from proportionally represented onscreen and elsewhere. Latinos and Asian Americans remain significantly underrepresented in nearly all industry positions; there is minimal presence in any job category for people of Middle Eastern and North African descent; and there's virtually zero representation for Native Americans on TV.

Experts suggest these must-read titles for adults and kids,"After a summer of protests around the country centered on racism and police brutality and calls on social media for Americans to take action, books have arisen as an important resource to learn more and support Black-owned businesses.

Reading provides a valuable look at the past and an avenue for continued research when the protests are no longer front-page news.

""A lot of people don't really know the history of why things are the way that they are,"" City of Los Angeles Director of Branch Library Services Chad Helton told USA TODAY. ""What I would recommend is really looking into the scholarship of Black history. That way you can really understand how racism has manifested itself and how it's become structural and institutional. ... All of what is happening is connected to systemic and institutionalized racism.""

Many major online book retailers sold out of books on fighting racism over the last few months, but there are other options for purchasing popular titles and exploring which published works are best for you. Services such as Audible, Apple, Amazon, Google Play, Nook and Libby also provide digital or audio copies for those who prefer or require learning with a different medium.

Nonfiction reads

If you're looking for resources on how to talk about race or to brush up on history and important Black figures, experts say these books are a good place to start.

“The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” by Michelle Alexander is a “great book to read,” because it talks about the systemic problem of the criminal justice system, says Lorenzo Boyd, associate professor of criminal justice and assistant provost of diversity and inclusion at the University Of New Haven.

Dr. Beverly Tatum, psychologist and author of ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race"" and ""Can We Talk About Race? And Other Conversations About Race in an Era of School Resegregation,"" recommends checking out ""How to Be an Antiracist"" by Ibram X. Kendi, ""White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk about Racism"" by Robin DiAngelo or ""Me and White Supremacy"" by Layla F. Saad.

""From Slavery To Freedom: A History of African Americans"" by John Hope Franklin offers a comprehensive look at how the foundation of the United States has dictated racism in the present, Helton added.

Following the weekend that saw Joe Biden win the 2020 presidential race, a handful of songs jumped in streams as listeners celebrated the election news.

Miley Cyrus' 2009 iconic party jam ""Party in the U.S.A."" made a comeback on Saturday, the day the race was called for Biden, and re-emerged in the iTunes Top 200 chart with sales up 810%, according to Chart Data and Billboard.

""Now this is a party in the U.S.A.!"" Cyrus tweeted on Saturday, which included an edited video of Biden playing her hit song as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris dances and Donald Trump is escorted off a podium.

The 27-year-old singer also retweeted a series of videos showing crowds singing along to her song in Washington, D.C.

'A new page for America:Hillary Clinton, Kim Kardashian West, celebs react to Joe Biden's win

This isn't the only throwback that saw major digital sale gains this weekend. Billboard revealed that rapper YG's 2016 song ""FDT,"" an abbreviation for ""F--- Donald Trump"", tripled in sales and quadrupled in streams on the Nov. 3 Election Day and continued to boost in sales with a 740% gain on Saturday. Over the weekend, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend posted a video of themselves listening to the song and tagged President Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.

Other re-emerging celebratory hits include Coldplay's ""A Sky Full of Stars,"" which saw a 5,353% gain after it was played at Biden and Harris' victory speech ceremony in Delaware, as well as Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" (up 996%), according to Billboard.

On the other hand, sales of Bryson Gray's recent pro-Trump rap song ""Trump is Your President"" dropped 79% between Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 and have generally decreased further since, said Billboard.

After days of anticipating 2020 election results, Joe Biden was declared President-elect on Nov. 7. He pulled ahead to receive the necessary 270 Electoral College votes and defeated President Donald Trump. to become the 46th president of the United States. His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed the processing of some ballots.

""The hypocrisy is unreal,"" Wallen wrote on Instagram on Sunday, after sharing footage of the crowd gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C.

""Time to start booking shows...If you don't agree with me, fine. We can still be friends. But I have a family, band, and crew that need to be provided for and taken care of. If it's OK for us to party in the streets with no 'social distancing' then we can book shows right now.""

That sentiment was shared by Chase Rice, who was widely criticized after performing for a tightly packed, mask-free audience in Petros, Tennessee back in June.

""...glad to see thousands gathering again,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Cool, glad that’s happening, concerts can resume.""

Wallen had his own COVID-related controversy last month when he was barred from performing on ""Saturday Night Live."" That was in response to news that he'd partied in close contact with strangers in Alabama the previous weekend, violating the show's COVID-19 protocols.

Sharing the same footage of Black Lives Matter Plaza in a now-expired Instagram Story, Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line said he ""knew we were waiting on the election since March when this (expletive) show started.""

""Time to go back to work AMERICA. Booking shows ASAP.""

On Monday, Kelley's bandmate Tyler Hubbard announced that he tested positive for COVID-19. The duo has been removed from the performing lineup of Wednesday's CMA Awards, as well as Lee Brice, who confirmed on Sunday that he had also tested positive.

Since March, the U.S. concert industry has been almost completely sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, several Nashville music venues have begun hosting concerts with limited audiences, mask requirements and socially distanced seating."

But with Clare Crawley engaged and out of the show after just four episodes and new star Tayshia Adams in, viewers are experiencing a season of two titular Bachelorettes for the first time in its history.

""It's been a whirlwind,"" Adams tells USA TODAY over a Zoom call Monday.

The move from Orange County, Calif., to the La Quinta Resort & Club in Palm Springs was quite the shift for Adams, who had eyes for another important man during quarantine: her peace lily plant, Herman.

""I would talk to Herman quite a bit,"" Adams says. ""He grew quite a bit.""

She left within 48 hours of getting the call from the show and went straight into a separate quarantine. She doesn't know how many COVID tests she took, nor how many days long she quarantined, but says it was long enough.

It was worth it, though. She couldn't pick a single favorite experience from her time on the show: ""I can't tell if it was the clothes, the shoes, the men. There was a lot, OK?""

How did it feel to have all the men there initially for Clare, and not her? Adams had hesitations jumping into Clare's shoes, unsure ""if I wanted to put myself in that position to expose myself to be vulnerable, and to put myself on the line if guys weren't gonna be accepting of that"" she says.

""And I didn't know how that was going to be accepted, but you will see that it goes over pretty well.""

She didn't have enough time to chat with other Bachelorettes before her time on the show started but she's since talked to Rachel Lindsay, Becca Kufrin and JoJo Fletcher. Lindsay was the show's first Black bachelorette, and she's since been an advocate for the series to up its diversity efforts. The first Black bachelor, Matt James, is set to debut next.

""I'm so happy to be a part of the change and the response that I've received from being the new 'Bachelorette' – but that's not only just the 'Bachelorette,' I'm biracial – has been amazing,"" she says. ""I I feel super loved and very blessed to have the opportunity and the platform to just represent a lot of women that look like me that might not see themselves represented in TV.""

Regarding any hateful or racist messages she might receive, she says, ""I try not to give that stuff a lot of light. But I think that the world is hurting but also so ready to start loving again.""

Adams' beginning on the show coincided with the election of President-elect Joe Biden, who beat President Donald Trump in the race for the presidency. Biden now has 290 electoral votes. ""I mean, it's been a big week,"" Adams says.

Biden has made it a mission to combat systemic racism and mentioned so in his victory speech Saturday night.

""I think this whole week has been like a victory for all of us,"" she adds.

Of course, Adams' season will include the usual shenanigans that keep viewers engaged (pun intended). ""I don't want to disappoint, so there's still some twists and turns,"" she says.

She says she still might have to watch episodes while covering her hands over her face, though. ""There's a lot of drama. You see happiness, you see sadness, you see love more than anything. You see me really diving into relationships. It's going to be pretty juicy.""

As for the process itself: ""It's kind of fun having multiple people fight for your love and prove themselves and be bold and make bold statements and be all cutesy. Who doesn't like to be dated and courted?""

Associated Press

Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard is the second artist so far that will miss a scheduled performance at the CMA Awards on Wednesday due to COVID-19.

Hubbard posted a note on his Instagram page on Monday saying he was asymptomatic and quarantining on his bus outside his home. It comes days after another artist, Lee Brice, also revealed he had tested positive and would also not perform on the show, which airs on ABC from Nashville, Tennessee.

The Country Music Association said in a statement that while it was disappointing that both artists would not perform, but it was a sign that their COVID-19 precautions were working.

“We have been extremely diligent with our testing process in advance of anyone entering our footprint,” the statement said. “Every single person has been tested, and many will be tested repeatedly throughout the week. This is in addition to wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) and of course practicing social and physical distancing.”

A representative for Brice told The Associated Press on Sunday that he is ""in good spirits and not experiencing any symptoms.""

Brice was tested ahead of the awards show, which will be broadcast on ABC from Nashville, where he had been scheduled to perform with Carly Pearce. Pearce and Brice are nominated for their duet ""I Hope You're Happy Now"" in the categories musical event of the year and music video of the year.

Brice, who is known for hit songs like ""I Drive Your Truck"" and ""I Don't Dance,"" will be isolating at home until he's cleared by a doctor, according to a statement from his representative.

A CMA spokesperson said Brice was tested and received his result before arriving on site for any of show rehearsals or activities. Although the show doesn't have a normal audience of fans because of the pandemic, CMA CEO Sarah Trahern had promised to bring country stars together in one room for the awards show, while still physically distanced.

""Lee would like to thank the CMAs and all of his incredible fans for his nominations and is wishing his fellow nominees an incredible evening celebrating the best of country music,"" the statement said.

It was described as a ""private visit"" by a person close to the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. But the couple shared seven pictures of themselves at the Los Angeles National Cemetery on Sunday, when Remembrance Day was commemorated in the United Kingdom.

Dressed in dark clothing with the requisite red poppies in their lapels, the couple are pictured walking among the gravestones and laying flowers that Meghan picked from their garden at their new home in Montecito in Santa Barbara County.

They put the flowers at the gravesites of two Commonwealth soldiers, one who served in the Royal Australian Air Force and one from the Royal Canadian Artillery.

Harry is shown placing a wreath at a memorial obelisk with a plaque inscribed “In Memory of the Men Who Offered Their Lives in Defence of Their Country.”

Harry signed a message with the wreath that said, “To all of those who have served, and are serving. Thank you.”

The two wore face masks when they came near other people, but removed them when they were alone or socially distanced from others.

Meghan wore a black midi-length wrap dress belted at the waist. Harry wore a navy suit with an array of his military medals on the lapel below his poppy.

Earlier, during an interview on a British military-minded podcast called Declassified, Harry said it was important to honor the Remembrance ritual, to pay tribute to those who served and to those who died.

""Remembrance Day for me is a moment for respect and for hope,"" he said on the podcast. ""Respect for those who came before us and hope for a safer world. … Even when we can’t be together, we remember together.""

Harry, 36, has strong links to the military: He served in the British Army for 10 years and went twice to Afghanistan, where he flew attack helicopters. He rose to the rank of Maj. Wales.

Before meeting Harry, Meghan, 39, once joined a USO tour to support the troops, visiting six countries including Afghanistan. Opposite the cemetery is the U.S. Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, which was used by her grandfather, Alvin Ragland, after he served in the U.S. Coast Guard.

Meanwhile in London, Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was on the job on Monday, issuing a message of condolence to the leaders of Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua after Hurricane Eta wreaked havoc on the region.

""Prince Philip and I were deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by Hurricane Eta,"" the message read, according to Buckingham Palace. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured or lost their lives, and all those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected.""

Eta, which made landfall as a tropical storm in the Florida Keys late Sunday, initially hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Nov. 3, causing widespread damage. Official tallies indicate the number of dead is at least 68 people, with hundreds more missing.

On Sunday, the queen appeared in a scaled-back Remembrance Day ceremony on a balcony overlooking the Cenotaph memorial for a two-minute silence to honor those from the U.K. and the Commonwealth who perished in wartime. There's usually a huge crowd in the street below for the ceremony but not this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The queen was not wearing a face mask. She was joined by her son Prince Charles, daughter-in-law Duchess Camilla of Cornwall, Prince William and granddaughter-in-law Duchess Kate of Cambridge.

On Wednesday, the queen, 94, donned a face mask for the first time in public when she appeared in Westminster Abbey for a ceremony to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. She wore a black face mask with white trim, according to photos released late Saturday night.

The ceremony took place one day before England's new four-week coronavirus lockdown."

This weekend, Netflix keeps the holiday movie train humming, plus debuts Spain's selection to compete for the international film Oscar, Eva Green is a mom going to space, and a few freaky flicks remind us that the horror continues even after Halloween.

If you're feeling the itch to get back to the movies in person, and there's a drive-in or it's safe enough to return to your local theater, the new drama ""Let Him Go"" teams up Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as a retired sheriff and his wife who, after their son dies, have to rescue their grandson from some shady in-laws.

Holiday movie preview:10 must-see new films to stream while stuck at home, from 'Mank' to 'Soul'

Netflix in November:From 'The Crown' Season 4 to Shawn Mendes documentary

But if you'd rather stick closer to home, here's a rundown of new movies hitting streaming and on-demand platforms this week, for every cinematic taste:

If you need a feel-good escape this election week: 'Operation Christmas Drop'

A real-life annual humanitarian mission in the Pacific is the inspiration for this sugary holiday romantic comedy. When her boss needs to make some cuts, Kat Graham is a determined congressional aide sent to a tropical air base – known for dropping goods to needy islanders – to check out its efficiency, and Alexander Ludwig is the good-hearted Air Force captain assigned to show her around and trade barbs. Anybody who's seen a Hallmark movie knows how this'll go, but at least an incoming typhoon and Virginia Madsen as a Scrooge-y congresswoman liven things up.

Where to watch: Netflix

If you dig space movies AND family dramas: 'Proxima'

In this look at motherhood and parenting through an out-of-this-world lens, Green stars as a French mom and astronaut training at Germany's European Space Agency who's chosen for a year-long Mars mission, but fulfilling her dream also means leaving behind her 7-year-old daughter (Zélie Boulant-Lemesle). Director Alice Winocour's film ably tweaks the usual space tale by having Green's stoic engineer weather all the usual training struggles – and a somewhat sexist American astronaut played by Matt Dillon – as well as the emotional toll it takes on both mother and daughter.

Where to watch: Apple TV, Google Play, FandangoNOW

If you're paranoid about your in-laws: 'Kindred'

Gaslighting, disturbing animal imagery – including a scene worthy of ""The Birds"" – and a pervading sense of dread run rampant in a psychological thriller that's not exactly innovative but decently effective. Tamara Lawrance plays Charlotte, a pregnant British woman planning a move to Australia with her boyfriend (Edward Holcroft) when he dies after being attacked by a horse and she's taken in by his family. As she gets closer to her due date, Charlotte's distrust grows for her dead lover's mom (Fiona Shaw) and his stepbrother (Jack Lowden), though are they the problem or is it all in her head?

If you want an emotionally complex war story: 'The Endless Trench'

Beginning in 1936 at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Republican newlywed Higinio (Antonio de la Torre) is hunted by Nationalists, betrayed by a neighbor (Vicente Vergara) and hidden by his seamstress wife Rosa (Belén Cuesta) for the next 33 years. While it helps to know a bit about the politics of the time (a quick Google will hook you up), the core relationship dynamic fuels the well-acted drama. In the film – Spain's choice to tussle for the international Oscar – Rosa yearns for normalcy yet Higinio's crippling paranoia turns his need to stay hidden into a choice rather than a necessity.

Where to watch: Netflix

If you're really hard up for a superhero movie: 'Mortal'

The latest from filmmaker André Øvredal (who directed the very cool ""Trollhunter"") is a strange beast, a film with some cool moments that ultimately loses itself between expansive indie thriller and odd fantasy franchise-starter. Nat Wolff plays an American backpacker with crazy powers he doesn't understand who, when venturing through a Norwegian town, accidentally kills a bullying youngster without even touching him. A psychologist (Iben Akerlie) is brought in but soon enough they're on the lam and trying to figure out what his deal is, leading them to some old-school Viking mythology and a lot of iffy computer-generated images.

Where to watch: Apple TV, Google Play, FandangoNOW

If you haven't had enough bleakness in your life: 'The Dark and the Wicked'

Bryan Bertino (""The Monster"") writes and directs a brutally unnerving creepfest set on a farm where a bedridden man is dying (Michael Zagst), darkness has infected his wife (Julie Oliver-Touchstone), and their grown-up daughter (Marin Ireland) and son (Michael Abbott Jr.) show up right in time for things to get really bad. A shapeshifting figure makes itself known and the family wrestles with a foreboding doom that's entrenched in the house. It's good but be warned that it's extraordinarily dreary, if that's not your jam.

Where to watch: Apple TV, Google Play, FandangoNOW

If you're curious to see a millennial version of a 'Saw' movie: 'Triggered'

Nine friends, all a part of a dark secret no one wants to talk about, return for their high school homecoming, party hard in the woods and then wake up in the middle of the night with high-tech time bombs attached to their chests. The gory survival thriller has an interesting premise that twists familiar tropes (from horror traps to final girls) and offers a few bloody good kills, yet wears out its welcome with an overlong run time and a bunch of nondescript characters played by relatively unknown faces. (In other words, good luck trying to keep them all straight in the dark.)

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

For this year's elections, Gannett’s consumer product team has built a new system that is being deployed across the USA TODAY NETWORK to support results from more than 10,000 races. Aimed at supporting and solving the needs of newsrooms across the nation, both small and large, the product team created an internal results tool that will provide unified results for USA TODAY and Gannett’s more than 250 local newsrooms.

The team created the system to publish results that would allow USA TODAY and local sites to embed live results within news stories for any Associated Press-covered race across desktop, mobile web, and mobile apps. Additionally, 130 local newsrooms will be entering results for more than 4,000 local races across the U.S. that will not be covered by the AP, providing election results from the national level down to the local clerk. Readers, while engaging in any election coverage, will have live, real-time results information no matter which site they are visiting us on.

The in-house platform brings a unique level of local and national elections results in a truly modern way that only Gannett could provide given the number of local communities within the USA TODAY NETWORK. The real-time information will have a uniform look and feel across all news sites.

This effort is another example of the organization’s commitment to helping serve small, mid-sized, and national newsrooms and local audiences. By creating an easy and modern election results tool, newsrooms will be able to focus on stories within their communities as election results will be published through the platform, rather than focusing on reporting their communities' election results in addition to covering the top stories. This allows for flexibility as the needs for newsrooms tend to shift rapidly throughout election week.

“As one of the largest publishers in the U.S., across 46 states and over 70 news properties in the core swing states, we’re bringing our audience election results in an innovative, real-time manner while providing our team of journalists the opportunity to focus on doing what they do best – cover the news and stories in their communities,” said Jeff Moriarty, Senior Vice President, Consumer Products. “Testing this system during the primary season came with much success for our results reporting tool and we look forward to being a go-to-source for elections results for our communities across the country.”

Elections results published across the USA TODAY NETWORK will include new landing pages for each state and their legislative bodies and embeddable modules for local sites for single races and for national races. They will also be maximized for search engine optimization.

An example can be viewed below."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

In an unprecedented partnership, nine newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network, including the Des Moines Register, and Lee Enterprises in Iowa joined forces to publish a collaborative project called “Iowa Mourns,” which identifies and tells the stories of Iowans who died from COVID-19.

In addition to pinpointing more than 200 Iowans who passed due to the pandemic, “Iowa Mourns” includes about 60 feature stories about friends, colleagues and neighbors ranging in age from 29 to 108. However, instead of focusing on diagnosis, these remembrances spotlight people’s lives: who they were, what they did and how they lived before they died.

By profiling the lost, the project sought to ensure they would live on through the memories of those left behind.

Journalists from across the state collected stories of Iowans who died from COVID-19 “to ensure their lives are remembered — now and forever,” Courtney Crowder, the Register’s Iowa columnist, wrote in a column introducing the project. “In writing about them, we hope to concentrate on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their death. We hope to tell the whole story of them, not dwell just on the final moments.”

In gathering these stories and names, the project has created a community of those impacted by loss, Crowder said.

“It was incredibly moving to see journalists across Iowa work together to highlight the people in our towns and cities who are no longer with us due to COVID-19,” Crowder said. “The work we’ve done here will make sure that no one forgets how this pandemic has permanently changed the face of our state.”

John Humenik, Lee Enterprises’ vice president of news and chief content officer, said the combined effort of the two companies will allow these inspirational stories to reach readers throughout Iowa and beyond.

“Nothing is more local than telling the stories of people and their lives. This level of collaboration between our companies ensures these important stories will be told and told well,” Humenik said.

The “Iowa Mourns” 24-page full-color special section is available in print Oct. 11 and through the Des Moines Register e-edition. The in-depth profiles can be viewed here."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY is partnering with Google to launch Web Story experience in Google Discover.

Google today announced a dedicated Web Story carousel with Discover, and USA TODAY is working with Google as one of the premier publishers to feature the new product.

The Web Stories format is an innovative and engaging way to both create and consume content on the open web. Notably, unlike other storytelling platforms where stories only live for 24 hours, Web Stories do not disappear after 24 hours.

USA TODAY published its first Web Story, which showed the destruction and devastation one year after Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano erupted, in 2019 and now regularly uses Web Stories on a range of newsworthy and timely topics.

USA TODAY recently used the format for a news story on why mail-in voting is so controversial and for one on systemic racism. Travel and lifestyle stories include BEST Road trips USA, Tips for decorating a cake, Old-school hobbies making a comeback and How to pick the best watermelon. In total, USA TODAY and other Gannett brands such as 10Best, Reviewed, and Golfweek have published nearly 600 Web Stories.

“The Web Stories storytelling format aligns with our goal of engaging news consumers on their mobile phone and helps us reach new audiences through Google Search and Discover. USA TODAY is known for high-quality visuals, so this platform allows us to highlight the strong of our photos, video, and graphics teams in the newsroom,” said Alexandra Ptachick, Audience Editor of Emerging Platforms at USA TODAY.

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY announced today that a team of expert reporters will provide comprehensive on-screen fact checking for the 2020 presidential and vice-presidential debates. The on-screen fact checking will provide USA TODAY livestream viewers with immediate context from topical experts to help hold each candidate accountable for their claims during the debates.

USA TODAY journalists are offering their expertise on various topics that have become key issues for voters in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, including COVID-19, the economy, social justice, health care, education, immigration, and the U.S. Supreme Court. Information about the team of experts can be found at debates2020.usatoday.com.

The fact checks will appear live on screen as concise, declarative statements of facts, similar to the USA TODAY Coronavirus Task Force fact checking unit.

USA TODAY will be livestreaming the debates on all USA TODAY owned and operated channels, including usatoday.com. Viewers can also engage with USA TODAY’s fact check team via the USA TODAY Politics account on Twitter, where experts will be available to offer further context beyond what is provided on-screen in real time.

USA TODAY will feature its innovative fact checking for each of the presidential debates, starting with the first tonight, and for the vice-presidential debate, which is being moderated by USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page on Oct. 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

“Our reporters have deep expertise on the topics being discussed in the debates. They’ll use that knowledge to provide instant context and fact checks,” said Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY editor in chief. “By providing this context on the same screen as the debate, viewers will get real-time information that will help them understand the topics fully in the moment.”

""This is not your normal livestream. We're executing against a fully remote, cloud-based workflow and combining the efforts of our live fact-checking teams and video teams across the country into a streamlined, real-time experience for our viewers that adds context to the debates. We're building upon a workflow we pioneered with our real-time, on-screen fact check of the Coronavirus Task Force briefings. Those reached millions of viewers across the USA Today Network, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, so we know this is an experience our audience values,” said Russ Torres, vice president of video and strategy for USA TODAY NETWORK.

Prior to every debate, USA TODAY reporters will preview the night’s topics in a pre-show discussion that can be viewed at debates2020.usatoday.com. Additionally, USA TODAY will be covering the debates by text as well, again for instant updates. Viewers can sign up for this service here.

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Gannett Co., Inc. announced today that Mayur Gupta will join the company as its new Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer.

In this new role, Mr. Gupta will be responsible for driving the vision and strategy as the company transforms to a subscription-led content business. This continuous evolution in a digital economy will strengthen the company's mission to build trusted local communities at the intersection of the organization’s direct-to-consumer and business-to-business endeavors. He will also lead the marketing and growth functions, connecting data, technology, and storytelling to deliver original content through apps, audio, video, live events, and emerging technologies to an audience of nearly 175 million in the U.S. and U.K. In conjunction with his hiring, Mr. Gupta has resigned as a member of the Gannett Board of Directors.

“We are very excited to have Mayur transition from his role as a board member to join our leadership team,” said Michael Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gannett. “Mayur has a strong track record as a growth and content marketer at big CPGs like Kimberly Clark as well as disruptive start-ups like Spotify and Freshly that have re-shaped their categories. Mayur has already played a key role on our board over the past year and we are excited to leverage his unique capabilities to continue to transform our business model and drive purpose-driven growth. His experience building content-driven subscription models and his ability to execute on a vision and strategy with speed and agility align well with our goals for this role. In addition, given his board service he has intimate knowledge of the Company following our recent acquisition.”

“I am thrilled to join Gannett, especially at a time when the need for trusted, independent journalism and digital content could not be greater for local communities,” said Mayur Gupta, Chief Marketing & Strategy Officer. “Over the last year serving on Gannett’s board, I have witnessed two companies come together for a common mission and purpose to empower these local communities. I feel honored for this opportunity to lean into Gannett’s future as a digital content leader and contribute my experience to an already dynamic legacy.”

Mr. Gupta is an engineer turned marketer who has spent more than 20 years driving digital transformation and scaled growth. Most recently, he served as the Chief Marketing Officer at Freshly where he led a team of marketers, growth hackers, and analysts to make Freshly an iconic household subscription brand. Prior to Freshly, Mr. Gupta was the Global VP for Growth & Marketing at Spotify. He was responsible for growing the free and premium user base for the company with growth hacking and data-driven, always-on experiences; testing new growth strategies, business models, and partnerships. He drove the vision and strategy to establish a connected marketing ecosystem and growth machinery for Spotify’s multi-sided marketplace that connects the right artist with the right fan through programmatic discovery and accessibility.

Prior to Spotify, he led Marketing, OmniChannel Solutions business and Digital Capabilities at Healthgrades, where he successfully drove the digital transformation of the company while being responsible for the vision, strategy, and activation of one of the largest digital marketplace platforms in healthcare. He was the first-ever Chief Marketing Technologist at Kimberly Clark, responsible for the vision, strategy, and development of all digital and eCommerce capabilities across KC's global iconic brands.

Mayur Gupta joined the Company’s Board of Directors in October 2019. Gannett’s Board of Directors has begun a search process for replacing Mr. Gupta’s seat on the Board."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

The Gannett Foundation yesterday launched its 2020 A Community Thrives program to support projects which contribute to community building with a preference for those impacting historically under-served individuals and groups. Nonprofit and municipal organizations with projects aimed at building their communities may apply to the nationwide crowdfunding and grant program, which is now in its fourth year, through Sept. 11. The more than $2 million A Community Thrives initiative is sponsored by the USA TODAY Network's parent company, Gannett Co., Inc.

Organizations typically apply to raise money for a specific project, and accepted organizations will work to raise funds on their own through a crowdfunding campaign and then may be eligible for more than 100 grants.

More than a dozen grants set to be distributed are considered national grants supporting projects, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. Separately, incentives aimed at rewarding high-fundraising projects will be offered.

Dozens more regional grants will also be distributed for general operating support, starting at $2,500. These grants are chosen by local leaders across Gannett's nationwide USA TODAY Network of newsrooms.

Since the A Community Thrives initiative last took place in early 2019, Gannett has expanded the footprint of the USA TODAY Network after joining GateHouse Media to become the largest U.S. media company by print circulation, serving communities in 47 states. For nonprofits, that means more regions will be offering local grants.

Last year, more than $4.5 million was distributed to nonprofits as a result of the program. Applicants raised more than $2.5 million through their own fundraising efforts and The Gannett Foundation gave out another $2 million in grants.

Grants this year will be awarded based on the proposed projects' viability, sustainability, community need and service to historically disadvantaged groups.

""The Gannett Foundation grants will support our readers' top community-building ideas to help address local needs and ensure a vibrant, healthy community. We are committed to work in partnership to help our communities connect, act and thrive,"" said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, Gannett Media President of News and Gannett Foundation Vice President in a written statement.

Organizations may submit applications through Sept. 11 on A Community Thrives' website: acommunitythrives.mightycause.com."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY names “100 Women of the Century” as part of its ongoing “Women of the Century” project to recognize the accomplishments of American women in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. USA TODAY selected 100 influential women for its national list, and USA TODAY NETWORK properties across the country recognized more than 500 notable women across every state, the District of Columbia and the inhabited U.S. territories.

USA TODAY issued a public call for nominations in January, and a diverse panel of expert judges helped select 100 national “Women of the Century” who have displayed outstanding achievement in one of the following areas: arts & literature; business; civil rights; education; entertainment; law; media; nonprofits & philanthropy; politics; science & medicine; and sports. The complete national list can be found in today’s USA TODAY print edition and online at usatoday.com/womenofthecentury.

USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief Nicole Carroll interviewed 12 of the notable women chosen to the national list, and USA TODAY has begun rolling them out online, including in-depth sit downs with Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and entertainment icon Rita Moreno; Flint water whistleblower Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha; and tennis champion and social justice advocate Billie Jean King.

“This project began last year when we were brainstorming ways to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment,” said USA TODAY editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll. “We purposely use the words ‘recognize’ and ‘commemorate,’ instead of ‘celebrate,’ when talking about the 19th Amendment. We recognize that while the 19th Amendment was an incredible accomplishment, in practice many women, most of them women of color, were left on the sidelines.”

“But we also knew this was an opportunity to amplify the work of a rich and diverse group of women who fought with their voices, their ideas and even their bodies to better our country. Women often overlooked.”

USA TODAY NETWORK’s news outlets across the country asked their communities to nominate woman most notable to them and engaged local experts to help them name 10 “Women of the Century” from each state and U.S. territory.

""I hope that this project exposes people to women they didn't read about in their history books or see on television,"" said Philana Patterson, a USA TODAY managing editor who has overseen the project. ""We've got many famous women with household names dotted across this project, but I find myself most inspired by many of the women I didn't know who work in our communities to make them better.""

Additionally, USA TODAY NETWORK’s “Humankind” has launched a news video series “Womankind” highlighting the strong, courageous individuals who have made positive change in their communities. Also, as part of the project, the company launched two augmented reality experiences – one that brings to life famous women's suffrage speeches and one that explores statues of the women’s suffrage movement. Both experiences are available in the augmented reality section of USA TODAY’s app.

Finally, to bring this remarkable program to life, USA TODAY NETWORK’s Storytellers Project will host a virtual event with six storytellers recognized as “Women of the Century.” The event will be livestreamed on Facebook and YouTube on Aug. 18 at 8 p.m. ET.

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK is partnering with The 19th to distribute content from the nonpartisan, nonprofit newsroom’s newly-launched website dedicated to original reporting at the intersection of gender, politics and policy. Starting this week, USA TODAY and more than 260 local media brands across the USA TODAY NETWORK will begin sharing stories from The 19th with the aim of informing, engaging and empowering women.

The 19th’s evidence-based reporting will expose gender inequity and injustice on the issues that most deeply affect women’s lives, from health care to the economy to the COVID-19 pandemic’s disproportionate effect on women in every arena but mortality rates. The 19th will also deeply cover the role women play in shaping our democracy, from statehouses to the White House. USA TODAY NETWORK will play a key role in bringing these important stories to readers by featuring The 19th's content across its wide national platform with deep roots in local communities across the United States.

USA TODAY NETWORK’s partnership with The 19th will bolster and broaden its ongoing journalistic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. Later this month, USA TODAY NETWORK’s multiplatform “Women of the Century” project, which launched earlier this year, will recognize and celebrate women from across America for their inspiring accomplishments in the 100 years since the ratification of women’s right to vote.

""We are thrilled to partner with The 19th, publishing their stories across the USA TODAY Network. Covering politics, power and policy with an emphasis on women is important as we continue to tell the story of a changing America,” said Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY editor in chief.

""The primary goal of The 19th is to get more women more deeply engaged in politics and policy — and to do that by meeting them where they are. This critical republishing partnership with the USA TODAY Network allows us to reach people in more than 260 local communities around the country, an enormous step toward accomplishing that goal,"" said Emily Ramshaw, co-founder and CEO of The 19th."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK and the Smithsonian are collaborating to bring a summer activity guide, featuring puzzles, games and at-home activities, to K–8 learners. The “Summer Road Trip” at-home activity guide, which includes bilingual Spanish/English language content, offers learners opportunities to explore topics in STEM, history and the arts. An e-edition of the guide is available across the USA TODAY NETWORK today. It can also be download on the Smithsonian’s Learning Lab site, and copies are being distributed in select cities.

“As a kid, I would check out as many books as I could from my local library during the summer,” said Nicole Carroll, editor in chief of USA TODAY. “I was able to visit so many different places through the stories. We are thrilled to partner with the Smithsonian to offer this same opportunity to kids across the country with this road trip learning guide.”

Using iconic collections from the Smithsonian museums, the guide encourages learners to engage in a range of ""road trip"" activities, such as visiting an artist’s gallery, exploring local cuisine, learning about the local wildlife and much more. ""Summer Road Trip"" is specifically designed to provide activities that can be done without access to the internet or a computer.

“Educational materials based on Smithsonian research, collections and programming engage and inspire students and teachers across the nation,” said Lonnie Bunch, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. “This guide will help the Smithsonian to not only reach every classroom in America, but also to share our resources beyond traditional places of learning and reach students where they are.”

“Education is central to the mission of the Smithsonian,” said Ruki Neuhold-Ravikumar, the head of education at the Smithsonian. “As schools and summer camps across the country move to e-learning, we are focused on bridging the digital divide by providing more accessible resources for students and educators. We are excited to collaborate with the USA TODAY NETWORK to bring the fascinating content of the Smithsonian into homes around the country.”

An initial distribution of 75,000 copies of the 40-page print activity guide will be sent today to pick-up sites such as public libraries, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Smithsonian affiliate museums in Washington, D.C., and several states, including Arizona, Indiana, Texas, Georgia and Virginia. Students and families can pick up copies of the guide for free."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

A new documentary, “Athlete A,” released on Netflix today features the award-winning investigative work of journalists at The Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK and owned by Gannett Co., Inc, for the 2016-18 “Out of Balance” series that exposed widespread sexual abuses within USA Gymnastics, including by longtime women’s team doctor Larry Nassar. The investigation revealed that USA Gymnastics had for years adhered to a policy of not routinely alerting authorities to allegations of sexual abuse.

Reporters Marisa Kwiatkowski, Tim Evans and Mark Alesia, as well as investigations editor Steve Berta and visual journalist Robert Scheer, pursued the investigation for more than a year, with the first installment of the “Out of Balance” series published in August 2016. Their work helped prompt more than 500 women to come forward to accuse Nassar of sexual abuse under the guise of medical care. In “Athlete A,” the IndyStar team and gymnasts who survived Nassar's abuse tell the story of the local reporting that revealed a national scandal and helped bring justice.

The groundbreaking investigation had far-reaching and lasting impact. Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison, USAG's longtime president, Steve Penny, resigned and was charged with evidence tampering in October 2018, and bipartisan federal legislation to prevent amateur athletes from being abused was signed into law.

The investigative series has earned several awards and recognition for its impact, including the Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism, a national Investigative Reporters and Editors medal, the O'Brien Fellowship Award for Impact in Public Service Journalism by the American Society of News Editors, and Adweek's Hot List “Story of the Year” in 2018.

“The ‘Out of Balance’ investigation’s far-reaching impact is a testament to the importance and power of local journalism. This documentary brings to life both the incredible courage of Larry Nassar’s abuse survivors and the tenacity of our journalists who pursued every angle, every lead of this story to expose not only Nassar but a massive institutional cover up at USA Gymnastics that enabled the abuse,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, Gannett’s president of news and publisher of USA TODAY.

“Athlete A” by California-based filmmakers Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk is now available for streaming on Netflix."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY Sports launched a new podcast series, ""Changing the Game,"" focused on how women have revolutionized sports and the ripple effects it has had on society.

Brought to you by Artistry Studio exclusively from Amway, the new series is hosted by USA TODAY's award-winning sports journalist Nancy Armour who interviews icons, Olympians, and trailblazers in eight interviews. Each one-on-one conversation focuses on the female’s life and career, sharing interesting insights into how women have fought to shape the world of sports, and what they feel still needs to be done.

“I often say that sports are the prism through which we view society. When there is a fundamental change in sports, like Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball, it makes it tangible in every other facet of life,” said USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour. “The women we talk with on ‘Changing the Game’ embody that. By what they’ve done and what they’ve said and who they are, they are changing society’s perception of women. And by not being afraid to own their greatness, they’re showing little girls and young women everywhere that the possibilities are limitless, and nothing is unattainable.”

The series will include interviews with the following women:

· NBA broadcaster Doris Buke

· WNBA player Nneka Ogwumike

· Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez

· Former NFL assistant coach Jen Welter

· Former Notre Dame women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw

· BMX rider Chelsea Wolfe

“Artistry Studio is proud to join this team of remarkable women, whose groundbreaking impact in the world of sports extends far beyond the field, court, track, mic and mat,” said Kelli Templeton, Chief Marketing Officer for Amway North America. “As trailblazers in traditionally male dominated fields, they’ve empowered young girls and adult women alike to break their own barriers and achieve what they may not have believed was possible. As a beauty brand that embraces women’s greatest passions in sports, travel, art, food, fashion and beyond, we’re thrilled to be a part of this exciting new series.”

New episodes will be released on Tuesdays and Thursdays and are available at changingthegame.usatoday.com."

The USA TODAY High School Sports Awards shows, which were originally planned throughout April, May and June, in 59 cities and towns across 28 states will now be streamed online, enabling each community to maintain their annual tradition of honoring student athletes for their hard work and dedication over the past academic year. The award shows will be hosted by national TV sports personalities and broadcasters Courtney Cronin, Jesse Palmer, Dr. Jerry Punch, and Sage Steele, with customized streams for each community.

This year, professional and Olympic athletes have joined the program set to honor over 28,000 student athletes and will be presenting awards during the broadcast for each sport. Additionally, reigning Super Bowl MVP and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes will announce Male and Female Athlete of the Year Awards and Bill Belichick, head coach of the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, will present Coach of the Year and Team of the Year. And, NBC News’ TODAY co-anchor Hoda Kotb will recognize some of this year’s Courage Award recipients, athletes who exhibit extraordinary strength and courage in daily life, both on and off the field.

Individual sports presenters include:

• Drew Brees: Football Player of the Year

• Jordan Burroughs: Wrestler & Powerlifter of the Year

• Stephen Curry: Basketball Player of the Year

• Gabby Douglas: Gymnast of the Year

• Norm Duke: Bowler of the Year

• Wayne Gretzky: Hockey Player of the Year

• Michael Phelps: Swimmer of the Year

• Keli Smith-Puzo: Field Hockey Player of the Year

• Misty May-Treanor: Volleyball Player of the Year

• Venus Williams: Tennis Player of the Year

• Gary Woodland: Golfer of the Year

“As one of the most loved and anticipated events in our communities, we wanted to continue to provide our student athletes the opportunity to celebrate and be recognized for their outstanding athletic achievements,” said Jason Taylor, Head of Gannett Ventures. “The young adults across America have lost out on many commemorative high school moments - from graduations to prom - and we are thrilled so many high profile athletes have signed on to be a part of the experience to give the student athletes the special recognition they deserve.”

“I commend the efforts of everyone coming together during these uncertain times to make this event very special for our high school student athletes across the country,” said Olympian Jackie Joyner-Kersee, a past presenter. “This year’s celebration is very different from the previous events but is one student athletes will never forget. I am honored to be a presenter to salute some of the very best talent our country has ever seen.”

The broadcast events, made possible by the many sponsors and partners across the communities, will conclude with a national senior sports salute and message, “Don’t Stop Now”, recognizing high school seniors whose spring sports seasons were canceled. The video will feature at least one student from each of the High School Sports Award communities, and in most markets, a list of seniors who missed their final games will display as rolling credits. Celebrities who are joining the celebration will use the #DontStopNow message as a national movement of inspiration and recognition.

The broadcast shows premiere at 6 PM local times on June 18th. For a full list of individual community events, visit sportsawards.usatoday.com."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY’s Brett Murphy yesterday was announced the 2020 Livingston Award Winner for international reporting for his work on the USA TODAY NETWORK “Show of Force” investigation published in 2019.

The Livingston Awards for Young Journalists were established in 1981 to honor professional journalists under the age of 35 and are presented annually in recognition of outstanding local, national and international reporting.

Brett earned this year’s prize for international reporting for his work investigating a 2008 U.S. military attack on its own security forces in Azizabad, Afghanistan, killing dozens of civilians, including as many as 60 children, and the subsequent attempts by the U.S. Defense Department to downplay the tragedy.

For the “Show of Force,” USA TODAY spent more than a year investigating the Azizabad raid and sued the Department of Defense to obtain almost 1,000 pages of investigative files previously kept secret, having been deemed “classified national security information.” USA TODAY also obtained Afghan government records, evidence collected by humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, and a confidential United Nations investigation into the incident. In addition, Brett traveled to western Afghanistan to interview government officials, investigators, first responders, witnesses and the villagers who survived.

“I congratulate Brett Murphy for deciding to go back and go through the evidence that had been kept away from public consumption – from going to Afghanistan, to getting thousands of pages of military records that had not been made public, to doing the leg work in the United States, and to talking to soldiers who had been involved. Of course, the Pentagon didn’t want to talk about this. Of course, they wanted it to be kept secret, but Brett uncovered it and did an extraordinary job. It’s not only the stories of the day that are important, but it’s the stories that you go back to look at and come out with a different truth – the truth that wasn’t known at the time – that are important. We absolutely need that now,” said Livingston Awards national judge Christiane Amanpour.

“We're really proud of Brett Murphy's work, and we're thrilled that it has been recognized with a Livingston Award. The subject matter of his story was awful, but it was an important story to tell and in doing so he brought a measure of justice to an incident that had been largely forgotten,” said Matthew Doig, USA TODAY Network Investigations Editor."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Gannett this week launched “Rebuilding America,” an unprecedented national examination of how America’s economy is rebooting after nearly three months as states reopen for business. This ambitious project involving USA TODAY and Gannett’s 260 daily local news sites will give a coast-to-coast view of the country’s “new economic normal,” as told through the industries powering the national, regional and local economies. Stories debuted on Gannett-owned digital sites yesterday and will appear in print editions on May 31 with a nationwide narrative of what consumers, companies and taxpayers can expect as the American economy begins to accelerate again.

The project is a sweeping effort by the USA TODAY NETWORK, Gannett’s newsrooms across America, to empower its audience of more than 150 million readers. Gannett is leveraging its unique position as the nation’s largest local news publisher to chronicle the reopening and rebuilding of the nation’s economies – from Providence, Rhode Island, to Palm Springs, California. It’s a sophisticated examination of how communities, which endured shutdowns caused by the coronavirus health crisis, are aiming to recover and what consumers can expect.

Journalists across the nation are examining the national and local trends related to a dozen key economic and lifestyle topics, including auto sales; travel/tourism; retail; insurance and financial services; grocery stores; education; sports; home services; medical services; restaurants; and local arts and entertainment. The project maximizes the USA TODAY NETWORK’s ability to thoroughly examine and explain these issues at both the broader national level and from a close-to-home perspective.

As a public service to readers, the “Rebuilding America” content will be free on the USA TODAY NETWORK’s collection of digital sites.

“Our nation and the rest of the world have endured so much these past three months, and as America’s economy begins to reenergize and reopen, our talented journalists are there to chronicle this important moment in our country,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, Gannett’s President of News and Publisher of USA TODAY. “This is a news-driven effort to leverage the full breadth and presence of our award-winning media sites in 46 states, capitalizing on our national understanding of these economic trends and then explaining what it means on Main Street, USA, in 260 different markets.”

The compelling journalism found in “Rebuilding America” is complemented by messaging from an estimated 2,700 businesses around the country. Merchants, business owners and entrepreneurs are turning to the USA TODAY NETWORK’s sales organization, LOCALiQ, to craft strategic marketing programs that showcase their brands, products and services and also reinforce their commitment to keeping customers safe during this pandemic.

""Since the beginning of the pandemic, Gannett has proudly rallied to support small and local businesses across the country,” said Kevin Gentzel, Gannett’s Chief Revenue Officer and President of Marketing Solutions. “Rebuilding America is a powerful project from our news division which gives us the ability to help businesses prepare for the next phase of America’s reopening, and in doing so, make our communities stronger. It’s a great example of how our marketing solutions can complement our journalism to make a difference.”

Since the health crisis erupted, Gannett has had its eye on America’s communities – from covering every angle of the coronavirus pandemic to conceiving ways to assist local businesses. In March, the company launched Support Local, a digital platform to provide communities with ways to support local businesses, from take-out restaurants to small merchants. It has been expanded to allow for connections to volunteer opportunities and discovering local events virtually.

“At a time of great tragedy and uncertainty, readers are relying on the USA TODAY Network for breaking news, public service journalism and health-related watchdog reporting. We’re a trusted source of local and national news, and this initiative is part of our commitment to covering this significant story,” Wadsworth said.

Additionally, Austin Statesman Studio that is now a part of Gannett, was recognized with four Telly Awards, bringing its count to nearly 20 over the past four years. The team was honored with three silver and one bronze awards for their work with on a documentary with Brookfield Residential, Room Key and Zach Theatre and CAP10K.

“This is truly a team award, as the wide range of honored videos - from documentary work to full animation - required our account and creative teams to work in lock-step with our video experts on the development of concepts, creative execution, and pitches to our clients and internal partners, who trust us to continually push the envelope,” said Dan Hanrahan, Creative Director, Studio."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK today launched a series about America’s food chain to tell the stories of the people who are working to keep America fed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through a series of intimate portraits, Gannett journalists will shine a light on the lives and work of the people who pick the oranges, slaughter the pigs, truck the goods and cook the food, so our nation can continue to eat amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The first story published in the series is about a worker at a large meat processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota – the state’s largest city with a population of 180,000 where Gannett’s Argus Leader newsroom is located. The in-depth piece spotlights John Deranamie, who came to the United States from Liberia during the civil war, has worked at the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls for over eight years and contracted COVID-19 as part of his job.

Over 40 Gannett journalists from more than 10 newsrooms across the country are contributing to this series led by USA TODAY consumer editor Michelle Maltais and Des Moines Register politics editor Rachel Stassen-Berger. New stories in the series will continue to roll out over the coming weeks.

“Food workers have faced great risks to keep America fed, and we wanted to focus a spotlight on some of the people in the food chain,’’ said Jeff Taylor, USA TODAY’s executive editor for news. “The collaboration for this series represents the strength and reach of our national news network.’’"

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Today, the Louisville Courier Journal received the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of the flurry of pardons and commutations given by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin during his final days in office.

The Pulitzer Prize Board recognized the Louisville Courier Journal “for its rapid coverage of hundreds of last-minute pardons by Kentucky’s governor, showing how the process was marked by opacity, racial disparities and violations of legal norms.”

In order to conduct deep analysis, staff reporters quickly built their own database of the pardon/commutation recipients, including the person, their crime, conviction date and location, and commentary from the governor gleaned from his executive orders. They examined the racial breakdown of 336 imprisoned low-level drug offenders whose sentences were commuted and found that 95% were white.

On December 22, 2018, the Courier Journal published their findings online and in an eight-page special print section. On January 2, 2020 the Courier Journal reported that the Kentucky Attorney General had asked the FBI to investigate Bevin’s pardons.

“I have to presume that anytime a newsroom wins a Pulitzer, it’s an amazing feeling. But to hear the news today – with my staff working remotely, with all of us exhausted from covering the biggest story of our generation – it means more than words can express. This is for the taxpayers of Kentucky who demand accountability and public trust from their elected officials and expect the Courier Journal to ensure that happens,” said Rick Green, Editor of the Courier Journal in Louisville.

This marks the fourth Pulitzer Prize awarded to Gannett journalists in the last three years.

“This is precisely the kind of dogged watchdog work that brings accountability to our government. And this honor affirms that no matter how challenging the circumstances, we will continue to be there working on behalf of our readers to shine a light in the dark corners. The stellar work of the Courier Journal team is a reflection of our commitment to journalistic excellence in every community we serve,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, Gannett Media’s President of News and Publisher of USA TODAY."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY’s emerging tech team released an augmented reality (AR) interactive, Flatten the Curve: A week in social distancing, with the purpose of educating audiences on what active social distancing looks like. Despite all efforts, there will still be instances where consumers will have to interact in society and the interactive works to prepare users for those events.

The educational interactive, which takes place in an exaggerated animated city block, guides users through five activities where they must choose the best course of action to demonstrate proper social distancing. These activities include grocery shopping, checking in on a friend, going for a walk, getting a delivery, and a social gathering. During each scenario, a user must make decisions and a bar representing their infection risk may fill up, representing what potential risk level they may be to themselves and others.

At the end of each scenario, the user will be presented with a risk assessment that provides recommendations on safe social distancing guidelines, and the final screen will show the results of the game. Users can read more articles and best practices on social distancing from USA TODAY’s journalists and share their results on social media.

""We understand the difficulty of the time we're in and aimed to create an experience that would educate users in a truly interactive way,"" said Ray Soto, Director of Emerging Tech. “We hope users will use this interactive as a method to understand how their actions can impact the spread of the virus.”

Users can test their skills in the Augmented Reality section of the USA TODAY app."

The site, which provides free business listings, allows readers to search by city, and filter by categories such as restaurants, bars, cafes, and bakeries. It currently promotes the purchase of restaurant gift cards and will be adding additional features like special hours, remote access, delivery services, and special offers as alternative means to provide support.

Support Local is leveraging Gannett’s network of local news brands and USA TODAY to quickly scale up its presence in communities across the nation. Businesses and readers alike can add new listings and all businesses are verified using Google Places API to ensure proper and accurate business information. Launching with more than 1,000 restaurants, the platform will soon expand to include additional categories of businesses such as spas, salons and retail stores.

“We believe local businesses are the heartbeat of America,” said Kevin Gentzel, Chief Revenue Officer, Gannett. “We proudly support businesses in all of our communities and that is exactly why we launched LOCALiQ in 2017 – to help business owners thrive and grow. Support Local will give our readers and local communities the opportunity to ensure sustainability for their favorite businesses as we all strive to make it through COVID-19 together.”

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

To capture a comprehensive picture of the American electorate, USA TODAY is launching a new project with Democracy Fund's Voter Study Group and UCLA based on data from Nationscape, one of the largest election focused public opinion surveys ever conducted. The Nationscape survey will interview people in nearly every county, congressional district, and mid-sized U.S. city in the leadup to the 2020 election.

The weekly survey was designed and is managed by UCLA political scientists Lynn Vavreck and Chris Tausanovitch. It is fielded by market research platform Lucid and will conduct more than 500,000 interviews leading up to the 2020 elections, shedding light on attitudes and issues as they take shape. The survey asks questions about more than 40 issues and policies every week – capturing Americans’ attitudes as well as how they prioritize those policies. The project’s unprecedented size will also allow for demographic and geographic deep-dives on groups that are typically too small to examine.

USA TODAY and Gannett’s network of local market reporters will access Nationscape Insights analyses on Americans’ opinions across the country to generate interactive stories that allow people to understand the issues where voters agree and disagree, and how those opinions are changing over time.

This morning, USA TODAY released findings from Nationscape, based on interviews with 31,508 people conducted in 2020, revealing that Democratic and Republican voters both agree on issues such as background checks for gun purchases and tax cuts for families making less than $100,000 per year, but remain split on a range of policy issues, including health care and building a wall on the U.S. southern border. Among likely Democratic primary voters, the two issues where there is most disagreement are abolishing private health insurance and Medicare for All. The results, including data analysis and a data visualization component, can be found at www.usatoday.com.

“The Nationscape project is important for helping Americans learn about the diverse perspectives different communities have on key issues, and we’re thrilled to be able to leverage our local footprint in newsrooms across the country for this important effort,” said Nicole Carroll, editor in chief of USA TODAY.

""In this high-stakes election year, voters and civic leaders need the illuminating power of the Nationscape survey to help ensure our politics and public debate are as informed and responsive as possible,” said Lauren Strayer, Managing Director of Communications and Network at Democracy Fund. “Nationscape’s unique ability to help us understand the perspectives of Americans at the local, regional, and national level is unprecedented.”"

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY announced that Jeep’s “Groundhog Day” was voted the winning commercial of USA TODAY’s 32nd Super Bowl Ad Meter, the industry-leading tool used to track public opinion surrounding Super Bowl ads. The commercial received the highest average rating in this year’s competition, which is presented by Kia – a previous Ad Meter winner in 2017 and sponsor of the 30th Anniversary of Ad Meter in 2018. The commercial features actor Bill Murray in a nostalgic nod to his film ""Groundhog Day,"" but with a twist. This time, a new Jeep turns the problem of reliving the same day over and over into a joyride alongside the famous weatherman, Punxsutawney Phil. This is the first time that Jeep has finished first USA TODAY’s Ad Meter.

Voting took place on the Ad Meter platform at admeter.usatoday.com starting on Wednesday, January 29, at noon ET and remained open until the night of the Super Bowl at 1 a.m. ET/10 p.m. PT. Like last year, there were tens of thousands of participants. Registered panelists were required to rate every eligible national Super Bowl ad that aired between the coin toss through the end of the two-minute warning of the fourth quarter, including halftime, and, the ad with the highest average rating was named the winner.

The top five ads, as rated by the 2020 Ad Meter panelists, are:

1. Jeep, “Groundhog Day,” 7.01

2. Hyundai, “Smaht Pahk,” 6.98

3. Google, “Loretta,” 6.77

4. Doritos, “The Cool Ranch,” 6.62

5. Rocket Mortgage, “Comfortable,” 6.60

For this year’s competition, USA TODAY and YouTube launched a strategic partnership to bring data insights to the Ad Meter platform, allowing both participants and brands to see a more robust picture around the video popularity of this year’s ads. All commercials ranked in USA TODAY’s 32nd Ad Meter are also curated into a proprietary USA TODAY Ad Meter Playlist on AdBlitz, a YouTube exclusive.

“We are delighted to see that so many consumers continue to turn to the Ad Meter platform to vote for their favorite ads year after year. Ad Meter has become such a strong tradition that gives fans the chance to crown the Super Bowl commercial champion,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY. “Congratulations to Jeep on earning this year’s top spot.”

“It was an incredible year with Super Bowl ads that made people laugh and shared poignant and touching stories. Together with Josh Jacobs, Kia proudly used its time on advertising’s biggest stage to raise awareness and drive action against the issue of youth homelessness,” said Russell Wager, director, marketing operations, Kia Motors America. “Congratulations to Jeep and welcome to the Ad Meter winner’s circle.”

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, USA TODAY NETWORK launched the multiplatform “Women of the Century” project, which will recognize and celebrate women from across America for their inspiring accomplishments in the 100 years since the ratification of women’s right to vote.

“Women of the Century” kicks off with nominations of women who have made a difference on a state or national level in the following areas: arts/literature, business, civil rights, education, entertainment, law, media, nonprofits/philanthropy, politics, science/medicine and sports. USA TODAY NETWORK will work with historians, scholars and other experts to review the nominations and select 10 American women from each state and the District of Columbia to highlight as “Women of the Century.” Nominations can be made through Jan. 31, 2020.

“Womankind,” a new extension of our “Humankind” franchise of video series, will celebrate unsung women who have had major impacts in their local communities. Nominations for “Womankind,” which will feature both video and written stories, can be made through Jan. 31.

In addition to honoring 10 women in each state, in August, USA TODAY will announce 19 iconic American women as national “Women of the Century” and 10 women who represent the best of “Womankind.” These inspiring women will subsequently be honored at a special ceremony.

USA TODAY NETWORK will leverage the combined power of its more than 260 newsrooms across the United States to explore this transformational constitutional change for women – what it has accomplished and what’s left to be done. The series will include interviews with trailblazing American women, live events designed to empower and enfranchise, stories that cover the movement’s victories and shortcomings, augmented reality experiences that bring alive the suffragists in their struggles and triumphs and more.

“This is such an important project that will both look back at one of the most transformative events in American history and tell the stories of women who continue to advance women’s rights and opportunities,” said Nicole Carroll, editor in chief of USA TODAY. “USA TODAY NETWORK is honored to tell the stories of so many women who continue to impact and improve our lives in significant ways.”

New “Hecho en USA” content will publish monthly over the next several months and will explore how Latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns.

“With ‘Hecho en USA,” we hope to bolster the national conversation about the U.S. Latino community – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are increasingly born in the United States,” said Cristina Silva, USA TODAY national enterprise editor. “This series is launching in a year when Latinos are poised to become the second largest minority bloc in the country, and we hope it encourage discussions about issues that are of importance to them.”

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Hidden Common Ground, a nine-month examination of issues that divide America along with potential solutions, launches today with a poll that finds Americans believe political divisiveness is harming our democracy. Nine out of 10 say it’s important for the United States to reduce the chasm.

Leading up to the 2020 presidential election, USA TODAY, Public Agenda and Ipsos will examine controversial issues — such as health care, immigration and economic opportunity — and present solutions from diverse subject-matter experts.

In the first installment, USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page reports on the bitter divisiveness that marks so much of our politics and what citizens want to see in American public life. “By overwhelming margins,” she reports, “those surveyed said national leaders, social media and the news media have exacerbated and exaggerated those divisions, sometimes for their own benefit and to the detriment of ordinary people.”

According to the inaugural Public Agenda/USA TODAY/Ipsos survey, three in four respondents say there is more common ground among the American people than is typically recognized. Moreover, one in 10 respondents say political divisiveness is making them sad, anxious or depressed. Surprisingly, almost 40 percent of Republicans and almost 50 percent of Democrats say they would be tempted to cross party lines to elect a leader who helps bring the country together.

In the coming months, Public Agenda will produce in-depth research and analysis on major issues facing the American electorate. Ipsos will conduct polling on these topics, identifying areas of public agreement.

The results will be presented online at USATODAY.com and, beginning Thursday, Dec. 5, in a monthly special report in the print edition of USA TODAY. In addition to reflecting areas of agreement among U.S. voters, upcoming installments will give readers the opportunity to compare where presidential candidates stand on each issue.

Reporting on each issue will be accompanied by original commentary from the USA TODAY Opinion team as well as opinion pieces from diverse subject-matter experts.

Award-winning opinion editor and columnist Tim Swarens, formerly of the Indianapolis Star and the Miami Herald, is joining the project in the role of commentary editor. His work has been published in USA TODAY, the Wall Street Journal, the Arizona Republic, the Detroit Free Press and the Seattle Times. Swarens also has appeared on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and the BBC.

""Much of the political rhetoric and social media chatter in our nation is undeniably corrosive. But that's not the full story,"" Swarens said. ""Our goal with this project is to highlight the voices and stories of people and organizations across the country who are working together, in spite of their differences, to find solutions to problems facing their communities and our nation.”

Hidden Common Ground also features a unique partnership with the National Issues Forums Institute, which will host a series of moderated, online forums using its Common Ground for Action digital platform beginning Thursday, Dec. 5. A schedule of forums and information on how to participate can be found at usatoday.com/hiddencommonground. Public forums in communities across the country are planned throughout 2020.

This initiative is part of Gannett’s commitment to provide the most comprehensive coverage of the 2020 election, fueled by the company’s footprint in more than 260 communities across the U.S. Gannett’s effort will include industry-leading innovation in augmented reality, audio and video storytelling, interactive experiences and in-person events.

Public Agenda is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and public engagement organization dedicated to strengthening democracy and expanding opportunity for all.

The Hidden Common Ground project is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The Kettering Foundation serves as a research partner to the Hidden Common Ground initiative."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

As part of its unique local-to-national coverage of the 2020 presidential election, the USA TODAY Network and Public Agenda are joining forces to explore the Hidden Common Ground in American public life.

Through nationwide polling, detailed reporting and community events, Hidden Common Ground will explore areas of authentic public agreement on major issues facing the American electorate.

The project will launch in December with an exploration of where citizens stand on the need for common ground and its role in our democracy. Subsequent installments will delve into health care, immigration and economic opportunity, all accompanied by original commentary from USA TODAY’s award-winning Opinion team.

“We believe a strong focus on what Americans agree on can make it more possible for Americans to confront and navigate their real divides and disagreements, such as those stemming from tensions of race, class and fundamental questions of political philosophy,” said Will Friedman, president and CEO of Public Agenda.

Hidden Common Ground will also feature a unique partnership with the National Issues Forums Institute, which will include the development of issue guides on each of the topics and support citizens’ forums in communities across the country. These forums will provide people with the opportunity to deliberate issues in person, as well as online in moderated groups.

The initiative is part of the USA TODAY Network’s commitment to provide the most comprehensive coverage of the 2020 election, fueled by its footprint in more than 100 local newsrooms across the country. That coverage includes industry-leading innovation in augmented reality, audio and video storytelling, interactive experiences and in-person events.

“Our goal is to be an oasis of clarity around the issues most important to voters,” said Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY editor in chief. “We want to educate, inform and empower the electorate.”

A third element of the Hidden Common Ground project, “Strange Bedfellows,” will raise awareness of how citizens in local communities are working across perceived divides to solve community issues.

“Our footprint in 109 communities -- from Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state to places like Milwaukee, where the Democratic National Convention will be held next year – gives us the unique ability to explore themes of common ground,” said Amalie Nash, executive editor for local news, USA TODAY Network. “This project will allow us to dig even deeper into some of the most important issues facing the country at a time when common ground seems sparse but desperately needed.”

Public Agenda is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and public engagement organization dedicated to strengthening democracy and expanding opportunity for all.

The Hidden Common Ground project is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. It is also a major research project of the Kettering Foundation."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY today released Season 2 of “The City,” its critically acclaimed investigative podcast that tells true stories about the hidden power structures of urban America. The new season shines a spotlight on the battle over the future identity of Reno, Nevada, as the famously unruly city best known for gambling and quickie divorce attempts to reinvent itself as an offshoot of Silicon Valley.

To usher in a new Reno powered by tech giants like Tesla and Google, city boosters want to kick Reno’s aging strip clubs out of downtown. Their main target is the Wild Orchid, a gaudy former hotel-casino in the heart of the bustling Midtown neighborhood. The strip club’s owners, however, refuse to go quietly and many residents fear Reno is becoming not only unaffordable, but also unrecognizable without its vice.

The podcast features a robust cast of characters whose true stories illuminate the fight over Reno’s future. That includes Kamy Keshmiri, Reno’s strip club kingpin, who thinks the city he loves wants to put him out of business, and Stephanie, a stripper and single mom who stands to lose everything when she is caught up in the battle. Their stories and others illuminate how a changing Reno is impacting people without a seat at the table and raise broader questions around economic progress and growing inequality in American cities.

USA TODAY’s “The City,” created by host and executive producer Robin Amer, premiered last year and was named one of the best podcasts of 2018 by The New York Times and Apple Podcasts. The first season traced the corruption and mob dealings that led to an illegal dump in Chicago's North Lawndale community. For the second season, Amer and “The City” team collaborated with the Reno Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, and lead reporter Anjeanette Damon, to investigate the story of how power works in Reno.

“Season 2 is about ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances. They’re trying to save their homes, protect their livelihoods, and find their bearings as Reno changes around them. As unique as their stories are, in many ways this story is not unique to Reno. I think their voices will resonate at a time when so many American cities are changing and gentrifying,” said Amer. “I am excited and hopeful about the potential for Season 2 to have impact and spark dialogue as our cities weigh the costs and benefits of these changes.”

“The success of the first season of ‘The City’ demonstrated that our audience is eager to engage with different forms of impactful storytelling. I cannot wait for listeners to engage with the incredible material included in the second season of this fantastic podcast,” said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY.

The first two episodes of the new season of “The City” are available now at www.thecitypodcast.com, applepodcasts.com/thecity, and on all other major podcasting platforms. The rest of the six episodes will be released weekly on subsequent Tuesdays."

Staff

USA TODAY Washington Bureau chief Susan Page was named the recipient of The Alumnae of Northwestern University’s 2019 Alumnae Award and will be honored with the award at a ceremony in Evanston, Illinois this week.

Page, who joined USA TODAY from Newsday in 1995, has covered six White House administrations and 10 presidential elections, interviewed the nine past presidents (three after they left office), and reported from six continents and dozens of foreign countries. Her book, “The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty,” published in April 2019, is a New York Times best seller. She is currently writing a biography of Nancy Pelosi, titled “Madam Speaker.”

Established in 1976, the Alumnae Award is given each year to a woman who has made outstanding professional contributions in her field and who has attained national recognition. Renowned educators, journalists, doctors, scientists, and artists are included among the Northwestern University alumnae who have previously received the prestigious award.

“The Alumnae of Northwestern University is proud to present the 2019 Alumnae Award to Susan Page,” said Alumnae Award committee co-chairs Mary Schuette and Susie Stein. “She joins a distinguished group of women from such diverse fields as business, education, music, medicine, science, theater, and public service, bringing honor to Northwestern University.”

Page began her remarkable career in journalism during her school years at Southeast High School in Wichita, Kansas. She received a bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University, where she was editor-in-chief of The Daily Northwestern. She received a master’s degree from Columbia University, where she was a Pulitzer Fellow.

“My debt to Northwestern is deep,” Page said. “As a journalist, I’ve been struck by the number of women in positions of leadership in my field who are also graduates of Northwestern – for instance, my fellow Washington Bureau chiefs Elizabeth Bumiller of The New York Times and Julie Pace of The Associated Press. I don’t think that’s an accident. My years in Evanston broadened my horizons in ways I couldn’t have imagined when I moved into Shepard Hall my freshman year – the first time I had ever spent a night outside my native state of Kansas. To return to Evanston to receive this award is an honor I will treasure.”

Page has served as president of the White House Correspondents Association and president of the Gridiron Club, the oldest association of journalists in Washington. She has been a juror for the Pulitzer Prizes and is a member of the Attorney General’s media advisory group.

Page has won every journalism award given specifically for coverage of the White House. She received the Merriman Smith Memorial Award for presidential news coverage, the Aldo Beckman Memorial Award for journalistic excellence, the Gerald R Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency (twice), and the Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service Award for Washington Correspondence (shared). She is also the recipient of the American News Women’s Club 2017 Excellence in Journalism Award.

Page will receive The Alumnae of Northwestern University’s 2019 Alumnae Award at a ceremony that will be held at Evanston’s Orrington Hotel on Thursday, October 17, 2019, from 3:30-5:30 p.m. and is open to the public."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

With the country facing a record-breaking surge of immigrants amid a years-long political debate, the USA TODAY NETWORK launched a comprehensive report revealing the scope of America’s immigration challenge.

The USA TODAY NETWORK brings the full strength of its nationwide news coverage to “The Migrants,” a special digital and video journey through a week in the life of immigration in America. Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY’s editor-in-chief, said the reporting was as ambitious as it was unprecedented.

“The story at times is overwhelming, but so is what is taking place at our border,” Carroll said. “As journalists, we say all the time, 'show, don't tell.' Our goal was to transport our readers to scenes of the crisis, not just tell them what happened.""

With concurrent reporting from four countries, eight states and across the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, “The Migrants” reveals a system on the brink of collapse. It witnesses families facing death, and traces the influx to its roots, the decades-old challenges in Central American countries that are now exacerbated by new American policies.

“The Migrants” distinguishes itself from previous coverage of immigration, both in its timing and its scope. What's happening in immigration in America is not happening in single moments – it’s happening all the time, a torrent of movement and conflict that the USA TODAY NETWORK is uniquely poised to capture.

“This project crosses both physical and language barriers to share stories that will help people understand the breadth of this crisis and encourage discussions about its consequences and solutions,” said Carroll. “I am so proud of the team of journalists who remained committed to working so hard on this project well beyond the week-long effort on the ground.”

The reporting effort meant deploying more than two dozen journalists across the continent. For a week, they watched migrants prepare to leave Central America; crossed rivers and waited at military checkpoints in Mexico; found desperation in shelters in Mexico City and at the border; followed Border Patrol agents as they found families and children in the backcountry; and traveled by bus and plane with families who had been released to make their own way into the United States.

From June 24 to 30, the teams from across the USA TODAY NETWORK traveled more than 20,000 miles, including to the highlands of Guatemala, the National Palace in Mexico City, both sides of the border from California to Texas, immigration courts in Los Angeles and the lawmaking chambers of Washington, D.C.

Field reporting is the centerpiece of a project that also draws on years of data and policy expertise. “The Migrants” reveals that the crisis is much broader and violent than has been previously reported; it is resulting in deaths, trauma, violence, crime and previously untold costs. Reporters reveal how much local tax money American cities now spend caring for migrants the federal government abandons. And they trace the roots of the surge, in part, to a crackdown on the heroin trade.

“The Migrants”, with its unique combination of investigative reporting and real-world narrative, leverages some of the same journalistic talent behind USA TODAY NETWORK’s Pulitzer Prize-winning project “The Wall: Untold Stories, Unintended Consequences.”

“The Wall,” which examined Trump’s campaign promise to build a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting. “The Wall” was led by The Arizona Republic and other newsrooms along the border where journalists have personal connections and decades of experience covering the topic. Journalists from local news sites and USA TODAY collaborated on “The Migrants,” combining their expertise and deep experience in covering immigration issues to deliver a report that should resonate with national and international audiences.

The full findings of the report, including a documentary video with in-depth interviews, can be found at themigrants.usatoday.com."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

On the two-month anniversary of the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the USA TODAY NETWORK today published an original poem by noted poet Richard Blanco, the first Latino presidential inaugural poet for President Barack Obama. Blanco wrote the poem at the request of USA TODAY to capture the feelings of Latinos after El Paso and to celebrate the pride and resilience of Latinos during Hispanic Heritage Month.

The mass shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3 was one of the deadliest hate crimes in America against Latinos. Twenty-two people were killed and 25 were injured by a lone gunman who, according to law enforcement, posted a manifesto in an online forum that expressed a desire to kill as many people of Hispanic descent and ethnicity as possible. In addition to reporting on the crime, the victims and the heroes, the USA TODAY NETWORK reported the fear in the Hispanic community, and El Paso Times executive editor Tim Archuleta defended his city in a powerful front-page editorial.

Now, two months after the El Paso shooting, USA TODAY is running Blanco’s poem, which is inspired by the U.S. national anthem, as an opinion piece. The poem is also being made available to the 109 USA TODAY NETWORK news sites and has been translated into Spanish as well. Additionally, there is a video of Blanco reading the poem.

Through poetry, Blanco seeks to connect communities, advance causes and mark important milestones.

“In the wake of the violence of El Paso shooting, I felt an urgency to take a hard look at our place as Hispanics in the United States. I wanted to honor the victims and survivors of that tragedy, but I also wanted to celebrate our incredible contributions and historical connections to our nation, as an antidote for the fear and isolation we are feeling and fighting right now,” said Blanco.

The USA TODAY NETWORK seeks to share the experiences and emotions of our country. Often poetry fills a space left open by other forms of communication. Poetry offers a different way for writers to express their opinions in op-eds for USA TODAY NETWORK.

“Blanco draws attention to the perils and joys of being a Mexican-American,” said Tim Archuleta, executive editor of the El Paso Times. “This powerful work will hopefully get people to question why so many who have give so much to our country are still faced with questions about their place in America.”

Blanco is the youngest, first Latino, immigrant and gay person to serve as a U.S. presidential inaugural poet. He was born in Madrid, where his family had arrived as exiles from Cuba. His family immigrated to New York City when he was only a few weeks old and eventually settled in Miami. His experiences as an immigrant and growing up among close-knit Cuban exiles in Miami influences his writing as an author in his adult life. Blanco’s books and poems include How to Love A Country, which explores immigration, gun violence, racism, LGBTQ issues and more; Matters of the Sea / Cosas del mar, which reproduces Blanco’s stirring poem presented during the historic reopening ceremony of the United States Embassy in Havana, Cuba on August 14, 2015; and “One Today,” which President Barack Obama invited Blanco to write and share at his second presidential inauguration. His work can be found at https://richard-blanco.com/."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Maribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY NETWORK and publisher of USA TODAY, today was named the winner of the News Leaders Association’s 2019 Robert G. McGruder Award for Diversity Leadership.

Wadsworth, who joined Gannett more than 20 years ago and now oversees its 109 local newsrooms and its flagship USA TODAY, has prioritized carrying out the company’s commitment to diversity. She has led initiatives to ensure that a diverse pool of candidates be considered for every open position in her division and that the hiring team include a diverse mix of decision-makers. She also backed the creation of a position focused on developing a diverse pipeline of internal and external talent.

“She is deserving not only for championing diversity in hiring and promotion, but reinforcing the business case for diversity and inclusion,” said Mizell Stewart III, who leads Gannett’s news recruiting efforts and is the current president of the News Leaders Foundation. “To survive and thrive, news organizations must truly serve a changing America, and responding to a diverse mix of consumers is critical to our future.”

“What makes Maribel special in this regard is her commitment to fostering the kind of environment where diversity is a core strength and value, and one that attracts diverse talent. She is the perfect choice for a McGruder Award because she practices what she preaches,” said Amalie Nash, VP of local news for Gannett, in nomination of Wadsworth.

The News Leaders Association, a journalism advocacy organization, gives its annual diversity award in honor of Robert G. McGruder, a former Detroit Free Press executive editor and former managing editor of The Plain Dealer in Cleveland who spent his career championing diversity throughout news industry.

“I can think of nothing more meaningful in my professional life than to receive this recognition for leadership in diversity, an award that honors the legacy of the great Bob McGruder,” Wadsworth said. “I am grateful every day for the opportunities afforded to me by the groundbreakers and ceiling-smashers who came before. Each day I strive to pay it forward through a steadfast commitment to inclusion in our staffing and in our news coverage. This is how we, together, make a difference in our communities.”

Wadsworth has championed an emerging leaders program in partnership with the Poynter Institute that emphasizes diversity and offers mentoring and networking opportunities with top leaders from throughout the company. The program has a 93 percent retention rate, and more than 75 percent of the participants have earned promotions.

She has also supported an internship/mentorship program that now has relationships with media organizations, including a newly formed partnership with the Sports Journalism Institute for 10 summer interns designed to attract talented students to journalism through opportunities in sports reporting and editing. It will ultimately elevate racial and gender diversity in sports departments nationwide.

Michael Days, incoming president of NLA, said Wadsworth is a true diversity champion who is making a difference. “(She) is proof positive that when the boss is committed to making diversity happen, it happens. It’s particularly impressive that the significant gains are in top leadership roles,"" he said.

Wadsworth will receive her award during NLA’s Sept. 9-10 conference in New Orleans. She will also be part of a three-person panel on diversity leadership on Tuesday, Sept 10."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Since 2015, USA TODAY has been a pioneer in providing one of a kind emerging technology content, and it has now expanded to include an augmented reality (AR) section within its mobile app.

As of today, users can scroll down to the bottom of the sections within the mobile app to easily access the augmented reality experiences created and produced by the USA TODAY Emerging Tech team. In conjunction with the new AR section, USA TODAY’s app update will feature the latest interactive story published today, “1619: Searching for Answers,” which references the arrival of the first documented enslaved Africans.

Since the start of 2019, USA TODAY has already created seven AR experiences and plans to exceed that number by the end of this year. The newly launched section has five experiences from 2019 including, “Oscars AR: The costumes and creators,” “New Heights: Groundbreaking Skyscrapers,” “Make the Save,” “Apollo 11: America’s Journey To The Moon,” and “1619: Searching for Answers.”

“We continue to be dedicated to using emerging technology as an interactive form of storytelling, and pushing boundaries with the content we create,” said Ray Soto, Director of Emerging Technology, USA TODAY. “The new section will also allow our users to engage with our AR content more easily, and also make it more discoverable for new users,” said Ray Soto.

The AR section is now available in the latest version of the USA TODAY app for both iOS and Android devices."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY today launched the series “1619: Searching for Answers” to observe 400 years since the first enslaved Africans landed in Point Comfort, Virginia in August of 1619. Over several months, the multimedia project will share stories that retrace slavery’s impact on America.

The project highlights the Tucker family, who believe its American journey began with some of the first slaves who landed in the British colony of Virginia. Earlier this month, USA TODAY journalists traveled with Wanda Tucker from Virginia to Angola, where she believes her ancestors were captured and enslaved. Four journalists spent 10 days with Wanda on what she called “a life-changing journey,” as she searched for answers for herself and her family.

“I believed that the ancestors called me to take this journey,” said Tucker. “I really hope to do justice to my ancestors.”

""The landing of the first enslaved Africans in 1619 is one of the most important events and dates in our history, but it hasn't been treated as such,"" said USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief Nicole Carroll. ""We set out to correct that. Our goal is to educate and inform Americans about the history that continues to shape and influence the country we are today.”

The “1619: Searching for Answers” launch also includes an interactive augmented reality (AR) experience about the journey enslaved Africans made aboard the San Juan Bautista boat through the dangerous and deadly Middle Passage. The AR interactive was written by best-selling author Dolen Perkins-Valdez, narrated by storyteller Tamara Winfrey-Harris and showcases a painting by noted Hampton artist Richard Press Sr. Users will have the opportunity to step into a virtual representation of San Juan Bautista with spacial audio components, creating an immersive experience of being at sea. The experience guides users through historical events that have been researched and documented by USA TODAY’s editorial team, including the ship attack that led the enslaved Africans to Virginia. This experience marks the ninth project of 2019 for the USA TODAY’s emerging technology team which has committed to a dozen projects this year. The experience can be found within the new augmented reality section of the USA TODAY mobile app for iOS and Android.

The full multiplatform report featuring video and multiple graphics – including one showing slavery’s exponential growth – can be found at 1619.usatoday.com."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Nearly a year after the deadliest wildfire in California, the Arizona Republic and USA TODAY published a major data analysis of wildfire hazards in Western states that features interactive tools to help people understand the risks in their communities. The Republic and USA TODAY analyzed fire hazards across 760 million acres of the American West and found that more than 500 small communities face a wildfire potential greater than in Paradise, California, where the Camp Fire left 85 people dead and nearly 19,000 buildings destroyed. “Ahead of the Fire” allows users to personalize the data by looking up specific communities that are relevant to them.

The Republic and USA Today first analyzed U.S. Forest Service data of wildfire hazard potential (WHP) and then paired the data with more than 5,000 Census-designated places. Data reporters also examined other factors that raise risk beyond the initial wildfire hazard potential, such as evacuation constraints, age, disabilities, alerting systems and mobile homes.

USA TODAY NETWORK newsrooms across eight states worked together on the reporting for “Ahead of the Fire.” The interactive project includes an interactive map illustrating potential fire hazards, a data explorer, informational graphics, audio of 911 phone calls, photographs and stories profiling some of the highest risk towns in the West. The project received record interaction for the USA TODAY NETWORK.

“I am so proud of the work done by journalists, data reporters, graphics and visual teams, and many others across the USA TODAY NETWORK to give people the tools they need to become more aware of wildfire risks and hopefully help prevent the next wildfire disaster,” said Greg Burton, executive editor of The Arizona Republic."

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

Two documentaries from USA TODAY NETWORK are officially streaming on Amazon Prime Video. “12th and Clairmount"" and “The Wall"" are now available on Amazon Prime Video free to Prime member and available for non-Prime members to rent for $2.99 for HD and $1.99 for SD.

“12th and Clairmount,” is a Detroit Free Press-produced film about the Detroit riot/rebellion of 1967 that lasted five days and left 43 dead. The documentary provides an immersive look at what happened that tumultuous summer when police raided an after hours party at the intersection of 12th Street and Clairmount. Directed by Brain Kaufman, “12th and Clairmount” utilizes more than 400 reels of Detroiters' home movies and other archival video and photos. It was produced by Kathy Kieliszewski and Bill McGraw of the Free Press in collaboration with Bridge Magazine and WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and a group of metro Detroit cultural institutions, led by the Detroit Institute of Arts. The film premiered at the 2017 Freep Film Festival, where it sold out four screenings, and went on to play film festivals around the country.

""The Wall"" is part of the Arizona Republic and USA TODAY NETWORK’s Pulitzer-prize winning project that takes an in-depth look at the real-world implications of installing President Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Journalists from the Arizona Republic and across the USA TODAY NETWORK traveled the full length of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border to examine the possible effects of a wall on security, communities, commerce, the environment, immigrants and property rights. The feature-length film from the multiplatform report, which took home the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, features rare footage from some of the most remote reaches of the U.S. – from the canyons of Texas’ Big Bend National Park to the Southern Arizona desert as Border Patrol agents recover bodies from the desert. Directed by Brian Kaufman and produced by Kathy Kieliszewski, Emmanuel Lozano and Josh Susong, the film was screened on multiple dates in cities across the country last year.

“We are so excited to be able to share this engaging and educational content with such a wide audience of viewers on Amazon’s streaming platform,” said Kate Gutman, Head of Content Ventures, Gannett. “This is a notable opportunity to expand our distribution reach with the goal of furthering the impact of our fantastic journalism.”"

The Motley Fool

When you're a decade away from retirement, you're on the homestretch. But it's important to keep saving, because these final years can be some of the most critical as you're preparing to retire.

The last decade of your career can potentially make or break your retirement. If you let your guard down and relax, even one mistake could derail your savings. But if you take these three steps, you can head into your senior years as prepared as possible.

1. Adjust your asset allocation

Asset allocation refers to how your investments are divided within your portfolio. Generally, the younger you are, the more risk you can take when investing. But as you get older, your portfolio should gradually become more conservative so your savings are more protected against stock market volatility.

Keep in mind, though, that you also don't want your portfolio to be too conservative. Investing all your money in bonds and other ""safer"" investments rather than stocks can protect your savings, but it will also make it harder for your investments to grow because bonds, in general, have much lower rates of return than stocks.

One common guideline is to subtract your age from 110, and the result is the percentage of your portfolio that should be invested in stocks. So if, for example, you're 55 years old, 50% of your portfolio should be allocated toward stocks and the other 50% toward bonds. This isn't a hard-and-fast rule, and your asset allocation will also depend on your tolerance for risk. However, this guideline can help get you in the right ballpark.

2. Check your estimated Social Security benefit amount

Even if you're still a decade away from retirement, you can get an idea of how much you can expect to receive in Social Security benefits. And by knowing your benefit amount, it will be easier to determine how much you'll be able to rely on Social Security in retirement.

By creating a mySocialSecurity account online, you can check your estimated benefit amount based on your real earnings. This calculation assumes that you'll be claiming at your full retirement age -- which is 67 years old for those born in 1960 or later -- so if you plan to claim benefits early, keep in mind that your benefit amount will be reduced.

In addition, your benefit amount could change as you get closer to retirement. The Social Security Administration calculates your benefit amount by taking an average of your income over the 35 highest-earning years of your career. So if you still have 10 working years left, that could potentially boost your benefit amount.

3. Double-check your retirement savings goal

If you already have a retirement savings goal in mind, that's a great start. But it's important to double-check your target every so often to be sure it's still accurate.

Use a retirement calculator to see how much you should be saving, and really think about your inputs. Has the amount you expect to spend each year in retirement changed since you last calculated your goal? What about your desired retirement age? These factors can affect how much you'll need to save, and if you find that your goals have changed, it's better to know that information now while you still have a decade left to prepare for retirement.

Saving for retirement takes decades, and it's crucial to keep preparing until you reach the finish line. By making these three money moves during the final years of your career, you'll be able to start retirement off on the right foot.

Coli contamination.

The Salinas, California-based company announced the voluntary recall in a notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration website Friday.

The affected lettuce is labeled with a ""packed on date of 10/15/2020 or 10/16/2020,"" the company said. The UPC number on the lettuce is 0-27918-20314-9.

""No other products or pack dates are being recalled,"" the company said. ""There have been no reported illnesses associated with the recalled product.""

""The recall is being conducted in consultation with FDA, and is based on the test result of a random sample collected and analyzed by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development as part of their routine sampling program,"" Tanimura & Antle said in its announcement.

Trader Joe's fish recall:Gluten Free Battered Halibut recalled in 19 states over undeclared wheat, milk allergens

According to the company, 3,396 cartons of ""potentially affected product"" were distributed in Puerto Rico and the following 19 states, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Cases have between 12 and 24 heads each.

Michigan also issued an advisory Friday advising ""consumers not to eat Tanimura & Antle brand romaine lettuce packed as single heads due to food safety concerns.""

According to Michigan's advisory, the lettuce sample was collected at a Walmart in Comstock Park and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services laboratory ""determined that the strain of E. coli recovered from the product sample is highly related genetically to E. coli causing two recent illnesses in Michigan.""

The lettuce was sold in a zip-top clear plastic bag with a blue label and white lettering, Michigan said in its advisory.

The FDA tweeted that it was ""actively investigating"" and wrote consumers ""shouldn't eat affected product.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says E. coli symptoms vary and can include abdominal cramps, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. some people can develop a form of kidney failure.

Symptoms usually begin within three to four days after eating or drinking items containing the bacteria. However, the CDC states that symptoms can start anywhere from one to 10 days after exposure.

Last November, the CDC warned of an E. coli outbreak out of Salinas and linked infections to romaine lettuce.

Tanimura & Antle said in its announcement that it is ""unlikely that this product remains at retail establishments due to the shelf life of lettuce and the number of days that have passed."" The company requests anyone in the affected packages of lettuce to not consume it.

For questions, consumers are direct to call the Tanimura & Antle Consumer Hotline at 877-827-7388 weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The Motley Fool

You might already have an opinion about annuities. Maybe you're strongly for them, or strongly against them. There's also a good chance that you don't know much about them and you'd like to learn more.

Annuities have a purpose in an investment account but they're not a good fit for everyone. Here are four upsides and downsides about annuities that will help you decide if you could benefit from buying one.

An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company. You fund your annuity with either a lump sum of money or in increments over time. In exchange for your payment, the insurance company will provide you with either your lump-sum payment back in the future (with interest) or a guaranteed income stream that you can start collecting either immediately or at a later date .

1. Fixed annuities offer high rates but come with some catches

A fixed annuity is simple. The amount of income you receive is based on a predetermined rate which usually corresponds with a term. It can provide you with diversification outside of your bond portfolio or if you're frustrated with the low rates that CDs offer, it will usually pay you a higher rate. If you purchase a 5 year CD, you can expect to earn 1% on average but if you use that same money to buy a fixed annuity, you can earn as much as 3%.

Planning:Here are 3 easy ways to set a great retirement plan for yourself

In general, fixed investments don't keep pace with inflation well. You get comfort in knowing exactly what you can expect but each year but might find yourself struggling with maintaining your cost of living. With fixed products, you're also locked into your rates and if they rise, you can't always take advantage of them. Annuities have very little flexibility and if you sell your annuity before your holding period is over, you are assessed with a fee called a surrender charge, which, depending on how much time is left in your term, can be quite large.

If you value predictability over flexibility, a fixed annuity could add value to your portfolio. If, however, you have liquidity needs in the near term, limits on accessing your money would make this type of investment less suitable.

2. Variable annuities offer market exposure but often have high costs

Variable annuities help your income keep pace with inflation better than fixed annuities. They are a little more complicated though and your income is usually tied to the value of the funds it is invested in. If they perform well, your annuity will grow.

For example, if you buy a variable annuity for $50,000, and in the year that you retire it has doubled to $100,000, your withdrawal rate is now based on your higher account value. The insurance company you buy your annuity from might also provide some type of minimum income guarantee in the event the markets don't do well and your account doesn't grow. If instead, your annuity shrunk to $25,000 by the time you retire, the insurance company will usually offer some type of minimum rate that you can depend on.

This type of benefit makes a variable annuity more costly than a regular investment account and the extra fees can eat away at your investment return. Your account value is also reduced by any withdrawals you make and if the percentage of withdrawal you're taking exceeds the growth rate of your account, your account will get depleted. You can still depend on income, but say goodbye to your principal.

A variable annuity will give you income, but if preserving your principal is just as important to you, you might get frustrated with this type of investment. Additionally, if you are very conscious of fees, this type of investment is not for you.

3. Annuities offer tax deferral but without upfront deductions or tax-free growth

If you are someone who pays a lot of taxes, you can use an annuity to create a tax-deferred investment and reduce your liability. If you add non-retirement money to an annuity, any contributions you make as well as interest or dividends that pay into your account grow tax-deferred.

While your investment grows tax-deferred, you do pay taxes when you start taking withdrawals. The rate that you pay taxes at if you funded your annuity with after-tax dollars will take into account how much of your withdrawal is from your principal (which you've already paid taxes on) and how much of it is attributed to growth (which you haven't paid taxes on).

More:In 2021, you could earn up to $18,960 without having it impact your Social Security benefits

The benefit of tax deferral comes at a cost and when you start an annuity you are subject to the same tax penalties that other retirement money is subject to. If you take money from your annuity before reaching the age of 59 1/2, you'll owe a 10% penalty on any portion of your withdrawals that you owe taxes on plus the taxes. This puts limits on your taxable money that you wouldn't have in a regular brokerage account and if you're considering an annuity for this purpose, you should remember this limitation and weigh the benefits carefully.

You can also fund your annuity with retirement money. But if you're doing so, tax advantages shouldn't be your main objective since these accounts already have the benefit of tax deferral. A good reason for buying an annuity with your 401(k) or IRA is for the income stream. Since most employers don't offer pensions anymore, you can create your own pension-like investment with an annuity

Annuities have good and bad qualities and they're not for everyone. Deciding if an annuity is right for you requires that you educate yourself about them and examine your needs. If the pros they provide match your need and outweigh the cons, annuities could make up a very important part of your investment plan.

But first, it's important to do understand the limits of what President Job Biden can do. A potentially split Congress would constrain his ability to roll out plans for a large-scale fiscal stimulus, tax cuts, health care and climate legislation, analysts say.

“The likelihood of sweeping healthcare reform or massive regulatory action against Big Tech, energy or financial sectors would be significantly diminished,” Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, an investment adviser, said in a note.

In theory, certain industries could benefit from one party or another winning. Under a Biden presidency, renewable energy, infrastructure and stocks affected by trade policy stand to benefit.

But other factors beyond Washington can influence how industries perform.

For instance, the top two best-performing sectors and the worst two have been the same under both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump, according to SunTrust Private Wealth Management. Technology and consumer discretionary both posted double-digit returns during both of their presidencies, while financials and energy were the bottom two performing sectors.

Unemployment benefits:What a Joe Biden presidency could mean for the next COVID-19 stimulus package

Biden economic plan:What he means for the economy, your finances and another COVID-19 stimulus package

Following the last presidential election outcome, the consensus was that financials, energy and small caps would do well, but each underperformed the S&P 500.

Here are potential sectors and industries that analysts forecast could outperform, and those that are poised to face challenges in a Biden-Harris administration:

Winners

Technology

In a split Congress scenario, with a Republican Senate and Democratic house, technology stocks would perform the best with a Biden administration, according to investment firm Raymond James.

A divided government means minimal impact on the sector, analysts say. Regulatory risks for big tech may continue to rise modestly, but experts say they are manageable and will likely take years to play out.

Analysts don’t believe there is much appetite in Washington to pursue new antitrust or tech-specific legislation. Rather, it seems that politicians may be waiting to see how the ongoing antitrust investigations play out.

Health care

A Biden presidency with a split Congress is the best near-term outcome for health care, according to UBS analysts.

Substantial changes to health-care policy or drug prices now look less likely without a Democratic blue wave, the analysts said. More aggressive Democratic policies on drug pricing and a public option for health insurance are unlikely to pass a GOP Senate.

Moderate drug pricing legislation remains possible, but the probability of a bipartisan compromise on any health policy legislation is below 50%, according to UBS.

Infrastructure

Although a Biden victory would likely increase infrastructure spending, analysts anticipate that a divided government will probably reduce the size of any potential program. Analysts at UBS expect infrastructure spending to be focused more on traditional projects like roads, bridges and overall construction.

Biden’s green initiatives are likely to face more opposition from a divided government and would likely be scaled back—if they get funded at all. This scenario would be positive for machinery, building materials and construction and engineering companies, but negative for stocks of companies connected to climate, alternative energy, and green technologies given how well those shares have done recently, UBS analysts said.

Industrials and materials

A Biden win and a split Congress is a net positive for both industries due to likely lower trade tensions, no risk of a tax hike and less regulatory pressure.

Railroads, defense and waste industries would benefit from the lower odds of a tax hike, analysts say. Defense companies would also benefit from lower risk of a cut to defense spending. Construction, building materials and alternate energy stocks would be hurt from less spending on infrastructure and green tech, according to analysts.

Consumer discretionary and consumer staples

The consumer is poised to benefit from another round of stimulus measures, even with a smaller package than in a blue wave scenario, experts say. Historically low interest rates should help housing and home improvement stocks. Affluent consumers should benefit from a much lower likelihood of tax increases.

Losers

Energy

The outlook for energy remains uncertain. It has been among the worst performing sectors of the past decade, driven in large part by low crude and natural gas prices. Analysts expect some volatility until uncertainties, mostly pertaining to the oil price outlook, ease. Most energy risks will stem from regulatory policy rather than congressional action, according to analysts.

Regulation of the oil and gas industry will likely increase, though it will take time. Many states rely on the significant revenues from oil and gas production—a reality that may make restrictions on the industry more difficult under current economic conditions.

Still, renewable energy including wind and solar is likely the biggest energy winner, according to UBS. Natural gas, meanwhile, will remain an important bridge fuel and relatively cleaner alternative to coal for U.S. power generation, which should limit risks.

Energy stocks tied to fossil fuels have underperformed the broader market recently. While there are challenges for the energy industry, any efforts at sweeping changes by Biden could be limited because of the fragile state of the U.S. economy.

Financials

A Biden victory and divided Congress is mixed to slightly negative for financials, analysts say. The next stimulus package is likely to be lower than would have been the case in a blue wave, weighing on interest rates.

Bank stocks are sensitive to interest rate changes. But this is somewhat offset by a lower likelihood of tax increases.

Regulatory risks should ease somewhat if the Senate stays in Republican hands. Still, analysts expect that a Biden administration could name new regulatory leadership that could interpret laws and regulations in a less industry-friendly way."

Special to USA TODAY

Dear Pete,

Other than the stock market and the occasional reemployment surge, it doesn’t feel like our economy is heading in the right direction. I’ve been through a recession or two, and this one seems as bad, if not worse than all of the other ones. Is it possible we’re looking at years, as opposed to months, to get this thing back on track? I don’t think the stock market and its swift recovery is telling the real story.

Kris, Philadelphia

Peter Dunn: With so many elements of American life heading in the wrong direction, it’s challenging to know what is heading in the right direction. We’re all trying to read the tea leaves and find meaning in realities that might not have meaning below the surface. And to be fair, every recession or rough economic time feels different from the previous one.

Before we get too far, it’s important for you to know my mindset in answering your particular question. I’m neither an optimist nor a pessimist. My goal is always realism, but more importantly, I’d like to focus on the action we must all take to protect ourselves from whatever is next.

Let’s list the positive signs and the negative signs, and see if we can discern anything from those particular lists:

Dipping into your nest egg? Talk to your lender first.

Early retirement? Your company gives you an early retirement offer, should you take it?

First, the good.

As you mentioned, the stock market seems to be doing relatively fine. It took roughly 148 days for the market to recover from a massive drop off its Feb. 19, 2020, record high. That’s shockingly fast, although the Fed’s impact on the market prices with its monetary policy, potentially tells most of the story there.

The unemployment rate looks to be leveling off, but it feels a bit gross to celebrate that when so many Americans are still left on the sidelines. I do firmly believe we’re headed toward a “K shaped” recovery. This means particular industries will recover rather swiftly, while other industries will continue to struggle, if not decline further. I also think it’s fair to assume Americans' personal finances will experience a similar divergence. The wealth gap is real, and it will likely widen. Those of us who didn’t experience a financial dip, won’t have to dig out of a hole that we’re not in. While those of us who’ve experienced some financial adversity must rebuild what was lost.

Now for the negatives.

The wave of layoffs on the horizon is a bit terrifying. The airline industry alone is slated to cuts tens of thousands of jobs as of October 1, as government aid dries up. That industry’s layoffs could send ripple effects through others, big and small. That doesn’t give me confidence in the overall economy’s ability to recover quickly.

So there’s a small taste of the good and the bad. The real question is though, what are we gonna do about it?

The two bumpers for our financial decision-making are fear and greed. This has long been the case. When life and our personal economies are going well, we tend to loosen the purse strings and accumulate material things. And when we’re spooked by the signs of the global economy or cognizant of the realities of our personal economies, our spending becomes much more judicious.

Many of us are in a hurry to get back to normal, but we need to ensure our desire to carry on, business as usual, doesn’t suppress our natural inclination to seek stability and prudence. Of course, you’re scared; I think most people are. You need to use your current level of hyperawareness to assess the specific threats the economy poses to your personal finances. Understandable fear, without action, or at least a period contemplation, makes the situation worse, not better.

Will your fears lead you to spend less and save more money? If so, that’s a reasonable plan. If you possess all these fears and you choose instead to avoid thinking about how you can mitigate these risks, then you’re ignoring reality.

Whether you and I are right or wrong about the direction of the country doesn’t particularly matter. What really matters is how you use your level-headed assessment to prepare your finances for whatever’s next.

What to know about options, from debt negotiation to bankruptcy","The COVID-19 pandemic and economy-shutting measures to contain it came on quickly, over a matter of weeks. But the financial fallout – from job losses, reduced hours or wages, higher medical bills, mounting credit card bills and more – could linger as an unfortunate reminder for years to come.

Even before the pandemic, when the economy was humming, many people were struggling with their finances.

Several factors got Nicole Hudson in trouble.

“In 2005 I divorced and discovered that with credit cards I could afford the same lifestyle I was used to when I was married,” she said in an email.

But when the Phoenix, Arizona, woman became unemployed in 2011, she realized the extent of her debt problem. “For the first time in my life, I found myself without a job but still had the bills to pay,” said Hudson, 45.

“Before I knew it, I was swallowed up in trying to find a way to make minimum monthly payments on almost $19,000 in debt,” she said, in addition to a car payment, rent, utility bills and other expenses.

Hudson sought to have some of her outstanding balances waived by contacting a debtsettlement company, but there are other options, too. If you are among those facing a severe strain, here are three processes that can help, though all come with different benefits and drawbacks.

Credit counseling/debt management

Many credit counseling companies and nonprofit agencies provide budgeting and other financial education help to consumers in need, for free. Many of these entities also enroll struggling consumers in deb management plans lasting up to five years.

In these latter programs, agencies negotiate with credit card companies and other creditors to lower interest rates on a consumer's debt, thereby also reducing payments and combining multiple payments into one.

""We try to negotiate single-digit rates,"" said Mike Sullivan, a spokesman for Take Charge America, a Phoenix nonprofit that offers credit counseling and debt management services.

For a consumer who might be paying 20% or more in interest on credit cards, a rate cut to 3% or 4% can represent significant savings. In addition, debt management entities often try to get lenders to waive late-payment and other fees, which also can lower payments, Sullivan said. However, these entities don't negotiate lower debt balances.

Types of debt included: Credit card balances are the focus but other unsecured debts can be addressed too, including unpaid medical bills and payday loans. Some agencies also give counseling guidance on student loans. (Secured debts are those tied to collateral or property such as a home mortgage or vehicle loan.)

Fees: Credit counseling is offered for free, though fees apply on the debt management programs. At Take Charge America, for example, debt management services cost $50 to $75 or so to set up and $50 to $75 a month after that, Sullivan said. Over a five-year program, a consumer might incur a few thousand dollars in fees.

Impact on credit scores: Enrolling in credit counseling or a debt management program usually doesn't result in lower credit scores. In fact, over time, scores should improve as more debt gets paid down.

Creditor phone calls: These typically stop, as creditors receive payments as part of a debt management plan. Take Charge America surveyed its clients six years ago and learned something surprising. ""The No. 1 reason people contacted us wasn't to save money but to stop the calls,"" Sullivan said. ""Collection calls are terrifying to most consumers.""

Suitable for: The programs can make sense for people with modest financial stress who need an affordable payment plan featuring lower interest rates on credit card balances. However, participants in a debt management program also need sources of income so that they can start paying off those balances and other IOUs.

Potential drawbacks: As noted, debt management doesn't reduce the balance on debts, and the monthly payments still can be high. Consumers need income to pay down their obligations, and they must have the discipline to stick with these programs.

At Take Charge America, the typical debt management customer stays with the program for 38 to 40 months or so. ""That's a long time to live on a tight budget,"" Sullivan said. ""It requires some perseverance.""

A house divided:As millions of Americans face evictions, others buy dream homes during COVID-19

Consumers should realize that nonprofit debt management agencies receive funding from the banks or other creditors with which they are dealing on consumers' behalf. That might create a conflict of interest, but it also provides a way to make the model work.

""Without a partnership with the banks, we frankly wouldn't get those concessions,"" said Sullivan, referring to lower interest rates and fee waivers. ""Concessions are the reason we're in business.""

Debt settlement/negotiation

Debt settlement companies work on a consumer's behalf to lower principal balances owed. They encourage borrowers to stop making credit card or other payments. The idea is to divert this cash into a savings account that can be used to fund an eventual settlement. But the process can be nerve-wracking.

""If you stop paying your bills, you will usually incur late fees, penalty interest and other charges, and creditors will likely step up their collection efforts against you,"" warned the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees these businesses. ""The period between initial delinquency and settlement often reflects a period of financial distress for consumers and uncertainty for creditors.""

Creditors, though, have incentive to work out a deal, as that's often better than writing off a debt as a loss. Consequently, they might agree to cut your debt. What you spend building up that settlement fund is often less than the minimum payments on credit cards or the monthly payment in a debt management plan, said Michael Micheletti, a spokesman for Freedom Debt Relief, a company with a large operation in Tempe.

Debt settlement companies work on behalf of clients, without receiving subsidies from banks or other creditors. The American Fair Credit Council is one place to look for reputable firms. Those like Freedom Debt Relief that have operated for many years often have good working relationships with creditors, which can help in negotiations. These companies are for-profit, unlike the many nonprofit debt management entities.

Types of debt included: Settlement programs deal with unsecured debts including credit card balances, personal loans and unpaid medical bills.

Fees: Debt settlement companies charge fees, usually based on the amount of debt enrolled or reduced. These costs can be sizable, though fees are supposed to be charged only after a lower debt has been negotiated. Freedom Debt Relief, for example, charges fees ranging from 15% to 25% of debt enrolled for negotiation, with an average of 22%, Micheletti said.

Impact on credit scores: People who pursue debt settlement usually see their credit scores drop after they stop making payments to creditors and their accounts go delinquent. But once consumers reach a settlement and start paying down their reduced debts, their scores often rise.

Creditor phone calls: Bothersome calls from creditors or collection agencies continue, and often intensify, once borrowers stop making payments, until a negotiation deal has been reached. Settlement firms including Freedom Debt Relief coach their customers on how to deal with calls, Micheletti said.

Suitable for: These programs are most appropriate for individuals who are struggling with serious debt, perhaps exacerbated by a job loss, divorce or other hardship, but who also have income to dig out. ""These people have an ability to pay but they just can't pay it all back,"" Micheletti said. At Freedom Debt Relief, the average amount of consumer debt enrolled in the program is $25,000.

Hudson, who worked with Freedom Debt Relief to have her debt reduced, said the company gave her an honest assessment of her predicament. Although her representative ""spilled some hard truths, I appreciated the transparency,” she said. “At least I had a firm understanding of my responsibility.”

'We shouldn’t have to beg':Americans struggle without unemployment aid as Congress stalls on extending benefits

She now works in pharmacy benefits management and also resolved to live within her means. “It was hard, but it was the best learning lesson for me,” Hudson said. “It was almost exciting to see when each account was settled.” Creditors waived about half of her $19,000 in debts over three years.

Hudson said she had a good experience with Freedom Debt Relief, though the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined the company last year for not clarifying certain policies to consumers and for other business practices. Micheletti said those problems were corrected.

Potential drawbacks: Besides lower credit scores, higher fees and other drawbacks, some creditors might not agree to settle and, instead, could pursue legal action against a consumer for unpaid bills. Also, debt settlement programs require a lot of discipline.

""It's an austerity program where you're forced to put money into the account, from which we'll make payments on your behalf while negotiating with creditors,"" Micheletti said.

Like individuals who give up on New Year's resolutions, some debt-strapped customers find the program too difficult to maintain, he said.

Bankruptcy filings

Bankruptcy is the court-supervised process of wiping clean certain debts or dealing with them through a debt repayment plan. Details vary depending on the type of filing.

Filings under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code eliminate most unsecured debts, though consumers can retain some protected or exempt assets such as a vehicle, necessary clothing, furnishings, appliances and other goods. Nonexempt assets subject to forfeiture include second homes, money in bank accounts and various investments (though generally not pension or retirement accounts). Nonprotected assets are sold, with proceeds distributed to pay off creditors.

More:If you're facing foreclosure, be careful of scammers. Here's how to spot a foreclosure scam.

It is more difficult than it used to be to qualify for a Chapter 7 filing, with a means test that eliminates higher-income individuals. In Maricopa County, for example, an individual can't file with gross income above roughly $52,000, or about $87,000 for a family of four. Those thresholds change periodically.

Another version, under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, involves a court-supervised repayment plan. Debtors make monthly payments on certain debts but can have others such as credit card balances discharged or eliminated, said Diane Drain, a Phoenix bankruptcy attorney.

Chapter 13 filings frequently fail, Drain warned, such as when debtors don't stick with the plan or can't afford the monthly payments. When this happens, their credit issues don't get resolved. ""The wolves are back at the door,"" she said.

Types of debt included: Bankruptcy can involve a wide range of debts to be wiped clean (Chapter 7) or subject to a repayment plan (Chapter 13). Debts that typically can't be discharged include federal student loans, child support and alimony, most types of taxes and court-imposed fines or penalties for a crime. Assets bought with a secured debt, such as a home, sometimes can be retained if the borrower wants to keep them and can make payments.

Clearly, there are strategies involved, and working with an experienced attorney can help you determine which assets to retain. The State Bar of Arizona (azbar.org) is one place to locate attorneys.

Fees: Court expenses run a bit more than $300 for both Chapter 7 and 13 filings. Attorney fees might cost another $1,500 to $2,500 or so for a Chapter 7 case or $4,000 to $6,000 for a Chapter 13, Drain estimated. Chapter 13 filings cost more because an attorney typically is involved for a lengthier period. (Attorney fees might be due upfront or handled in a repayment plan.)

Impact on credit scores: A bankruptcy filing will damage your credit score, and the demerit with stay on your credit reports for seven years (for a Chapter 13) or 10 years (for a Chapter 7), according to credit bureau Experian. However, your borrowing ability might not be crimped all that much, for better or worse, because lenders realize you must wait eight more years to file another Chapter 7 and four years for a Chapter 13.

""My clients tell me that, within a week of filing, their (postal) mailboxes are stuffed full of credit card and auto loan offers,"" said Drain. ""Creditors see them as ripe for the picking.""

Even so, she recommends that anyone filing for bankruptcy wait at least a year to utilize credit again, so as to wean themselves from a reliance on borrowing.

Creditor phone calls: These usually cease once an attorney gets involved. Lenders or collectors who continue to harass borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy protection can face a court cease-and-desist order and possible penalties, Drain said.

Suitable for: A bankruptcy filing might be the right choice, and possibly the only choice, for people unable to repay their debts or, alternatively, those with sufficient income to manage a repayment plan.

As bankruptcy often is seen as a last resort, financially distressed people typically don't file until many months or even years after they get into trouble. Bankruptcy thus is considered a lagging economic indicator. Filings are still down so far in 2020 compared to last year, despite stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Potential drawbacks: In addition to legal/court fees and a long-term negative credit-score impact, bankruptcy filings are a matter of public record, open to inspection. Nor will bankruptcy eliminate all types of debts, as noted, and debtors are limited as to how frequently they may file.

No one-size solutions

These are the basic differences among three common approaches to dealing with unmanageable debt. Is there a perfect solution? Not for everyone.

Howard Dvorkin, a certified public accountant who has studied the problem, feels that debt settlement companies have had an ""especially bad reputation"" in recent years, though he also noted that there are shady lawyers and incompetent nonprofits.

""Debt management is often better when you have fewer debts and more income because it gets the job done with the fewest complications,"" he wrote in a recent report. When you have a bigger problem, debt settlement is more complicated but might result in a ""more robust solution.""

More:American spend about $18k a year on nonessentials. Here's how you can save more.

At any rate, he suggests starting with credit counseling, regardless of where you end up. Why? ""Because reputable nonprofit credit counseling agencies give you a free debt analysis,"" he wrote. ""By law, they must point you in the direction of the best debt solution for you, not them.""

Drain agrees and said she often recommends a nonprofit group, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, as a first step. But even after working with an agency, many debt-strapped people eventually return to her because they can't afford the payments. ""By the time they come to me, they're broke,"" she said.

Still, taking those initial steps, such as through credit counseling and debt management, can be worthwhile.

""It helps them to understand the system,"" Drain said. ""The benefit of working through the math of their finances is that it gets them to the emotional and logical stage of exercising their right to file for bankruptcy.""

The 68 million people – including retirees, as well as disabled people and others – who rely on Social Security are likely to receive a 1.3% cost-of-living adjustment next year because of paltry inflation, according to an estimate by the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group. For the average retiree who got a check of $1,517 this year, that would mean an additional $19.70 a month.

“It makes people have to take more out of savings,” says Mary Johnson, a policy analyst for the Senior Citizen League who releases an estimate ahead of next month's official government figure. “Other people who don’t have savings will go into debt. Many may go into poverty.”

A 1.3% COLA would be among the smallest ever and slightly below the 1.4% average over the past decade, a period of unusually low inflation, according to the Senior Citizens League. And it would be less than half the 3% average bump in the previous decade. This year’s increase was 1.6%, which boosted the average retiree’s monthly check by $23.40.

Pay cuts:More workers hit with pay cuts than in last recession, and stagnant wages could linger

COLA Zero:There may be no Social Security cost-of-living increase next year, early estimate shows

Nearly 43 million beneficiaries could see their cost-of-living increase effectively wiped out because of increases in premiums for Medicare Part B, which are automatically deducted from many Social Security checks. For others, the Medicare offset could make any COLA benefit marginal. Under a ""hold harmless"" provision, Medicare premium increases are generally adjusted so they don't reduce Social Security benefits.

Johnson reckons the Medicare Part B premium could rise by a hefty $17.40 a month in 2021 because of large pandemic-related Medicare costs.

Next month, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will announce the official cost-of-living adjustment for 2021 based on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, from July through September. The CPI-W largely reflects the broad CPI index that the Labor Department releases each month.

When, when not, to seek Social Security:Here are 3 Social Security strategies to employ when you're single

Each year, Johnson projects the July-September data based on changes in the CPI-W through August. In May, she released a preliminary estimate of zero COLA next year, but that assumed oil and gasoline prices would continue to plummet. Instead, those costs have rebounded in recent months, pushing the COLA into positive territory, she says.

Annual inflation has been meager, with the CPI-W rising 1.4% over the past year, according to the Labor Department. But Johnson says the basket of goods that determines that index doesn’t reflect the spending patterns of seniors who buy less gasoline, electronics and other products that make up a large portion of younger workers’ spending. Seniors instead spend more on food, health care costs and other items that have seen sharp price increases during the pandemic.

Since 2000, prescription drug and Medicare Part B costs have more than tripled, homeowners insurance has jumped 174% and home heating oil costs have climbed 172%, according to figures compiled by the league.

During the crisis, 48% of seniors have gone without essentials such as food and face masks, according to a survey the league conducted over the summer. Forty-five percent said their retirement savings dropped significantly. And 19% put off filling one or more prescriptions due to price spikes caused by COVID-19-related shortages or supply chain disruptions.

Over the past two decades, Social Security recipients have lost 30% of their buying power as COLAs increased a total 53% while the cost of goods and services typically purchased by retirees jumped nearly twice as much – 99.3%, according to the league.

Johnson has called for the SSA to base its COLA on a proposed index for the elderly called CPI-E that would put more weight on health, food and other expenditures."

The Motley Fool

You need to work to sustain your lifestyle – but you also hope your hard work provides you with a comfortable retirement. Reaching retirement age only to learn this dream won't come true can devastate anyone. Make sure that doesn't happen to you. You can retire successfully, but you'll need some careful planning. These 6 steps will help you get started.

1. Determine when you want to retire

Picking a retirement year lets you set a time horizon – a key measure for retirement planning. The closer your retirement date, the less aggressively you need to invest. If you don't reduce your equity exposure as you near your retirement date, you risk entering a bear market in the years before retirement. On the flip side, not investing aggressively enough while you're younger means your accounts won't grow as well as they otherwise would. Both outcomes might leave you without enough money to survive during your retirement years.

Looking to retire early?:The move has its drawbacks, here are 3 to consider.

For younger workers, choosing a retirement age may feel premature – but it is vital. The date you pick is a target, and it's not set in stone. You'll just need flexibility throughout the years if your life changes unexpectedly, especially as your retirement date nears. If you experience a major life event like buying a new home or receiving a promotion, you need to update your plan to account for it.

2. Assess your income sources in retirement

Do you work for a company that will provide you with a pension? At what age will you take Social Security, and how much money will you receive each month? A few people have retirement income sources that meet or exceed their working income, but the majority will make far less.

Retirement savings:Americans piled money into 401(k)s, IRAs even as the coronavirus-fuele

Figure out how much less by auditing your retirement income sources. That will let you know how much of your income in retirement will come from your investment accounts. The more sources you have, the less your retirement savings will supplement your income in retirement.

3. Assess expenses in retirement

How much you spend during retirement also matters. The presence or absence of regular monthly payments like a mortgage or car loan will affect how much money you'll need each month. Fewer expenses mean you can get away fewer retirement assets.

More:More baby boomers stay in their homes as they reach retirement, skipping downsizing

If you don't have many income sources, you'll cover your expenses by withdrawing from your investment accounts. Studies have shown that with a 50% stock/50% bond portfolio, withdrawing 4% a year will sustain your funds over a 30-year period. You'll want to keep your expenses low enough that your withdrawals don't exceed that amount.

4. Adjust for inflation

Inflation means that you can buy things for less money now than they'll cost in the future. If you've ever heard your grandma or grandpa complain about how everything costs more now today than when they were young, that's inflation. One day, you'll be the grandparent; instead of complaining about future prices then, you can prepare for them now.

More:Your Social Security benefits won't be recalculated if you claim ahead of time

Start by adjusting the amount of money you'll need each year by the expected rate of inflation – about 3% annually – and remember to compound that figure for every year you intend to spend in retirement. That number may not seem like much year to year, but over 20 years of retirement, you can expect the price of goods and services to double.

5. Determine asset allocation

Asset allocation determines which asset classes you invest in, and how much you devote to each. It is the driving force behind how much your accounts will grow. Shouldering a higher level of risk will leave your portfolio more heavily weighted in stock. It'll grow more over the long term, but also face greater turbulence. If you've invested too conservatively, your funds may not grow enough, and you'll fall short of your retirement goal. If you're too aggressive, you get swamped by market volatility, sell out of your investments, and fail to meet your retirement goals.

Your asset allocation model will take into account your risk-taking ability, with special attention paid to your personal feelings about volatility and your past reactions to market declines. There are many ways to determine this mix, but one of the easiest ways is by taking a risk tolerance quiz.

6. Make up for gaps

After taking all of this into account, you'll come up with one of three scenarios:

You're saving more than enough and can splurge some during retirement! Your money will last just long enough in retirement, given your life expectancy. You end up with a gap. The amount of income that you can generate each month is less than your expenses, and you won't have enough money to live off of during your entire retirement.

If you find yourself in the latter scenario, you can still make up for these gaps. Working part-time during retirement can supplement your other income sources. Winnowing down your expenses before you stop working can also improve this gap. You can also consider tweaking your asset allocation. Investing in a greater proportion of stocks will help your accounts grow over time; just make sure you can handle the extra risk.

No matter what, you absolutely must track your progress and make changes as necessary, especially if a major life event changes your plan. Successfully saving enough money to last throughout your entire retirement is a huge accomplishment. Achieving that goal starts with having a plan. A successful retirement is within your reach, but it will take time, diligence and action on your part to make that dream come true.

The Motley Fool

Your Social Security benefits are calculated based on your earnings during your 35 highest-paid years in the workforce. From there, the age at which you file determines your monthly benefit.

If you claim benefits at full retirement age (FRA), which is either 66, 67, or somewhere in between, depending on your year of birth, you'll get the exact monthly benefit you're entitled to based on your earnings record. You can also file before FRA, starting at age 62, for a reduced benefit, or delay your benefits past FRA and boost them by 8% a year up to age 70.

Looking to retire early?:The move has its drawbacks, here are 3 to consider.

More:You can work while collecting Social Security but there are limits if you earn more than $18,240 a year

Married couples have a certain advantage when it comes to claiming Social Security. Specifically, they can claim benefits at separate times so as to generate income earlier on in retirement while also letting their benefits grow.

Here's an example. Say both parties in a couple have an FRA of 67, but that couple wants to retire at 62. One member of that couple can claim benefits then, albeit at a reduced rate, to bring in some money to live on. The other member of that couple can then hold off on filing until FRA or beyond.

When you're single, however, you don't get that option, so timing your filing just right is crucial. With that in mind, here are three strategies to look at when you're navigating retirement solo.

1. File for benefits at FRA

Claiming benefits before FRA when you're single could be a bad idea, as doing so leaves you with a lower monthly benefit for life. It could pay to wait until FRA to sign up for Social Security. That way, you're not waiting too long to get your money, but you're also not reducing your benefits.

2. Delay benefits until age 70

The downside of being single – both during retirement and when you're younger – is not having anyone to split living expenses with. You'll have just your own Social Security income to live on, and not a second set of benefits.

More:Your Social Security benefits won't be recalculated if you claim ahead of time

That's why delaying your filing all the way until age 70 could make sense. That way, you'll get the maximum monthly benefit possible, which could help compensate for the fact that you're going it alone financially.

3. File early – but not too early

Some seniors can't afford to delay their benefits past FRA, or even wait until FRA. If health problems or workplace changes have made it so you can't continue to work full time or at all, you may have no choice but to claim Social Security prior to reaching FRA.

If that's the case, try postponing your filing as long as possible to minimize the hit to your benefits. For example, if you're laid off from your job at age 62 but have near-term savings and a severance package that will allow you to cover your living expenses for a year, don't sign up for Social Security right away. Put off your filing until age 63 so you're not slashing your benefits quite as severely.

LinkedIn, which has 700 million members, redesigned its website, introducing ""Stories,"" ephemeral posts first popularized by Snapchat, then exploited by Facebook and its Instagram. The changes rolled out Thursday.

LinkedIn, which once was a place where people posted their resumes and looked for connections, has evolved into a more robust social network of people who use it for more than job seeking, according to the company.

Job seekers:LinkedIn's tips for virtual job interviews: Here's what you need to know before turning the webcam on

Pounding the pavement:How to network while working from home: Start with reaching out and contacting folks

""We're seeing people share more and comment more,"" says Kiran Prasad, LinkedIn vice president of product, as users seek ""a stronger sense of community on the platform."" He calls the evolution a ""rebirth of LinkedIn as a social network where people want to form community and conversations.""

LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky admits on a company blog post that Stories are not new, ""but we took the time to understand how Stories fit in the professional context"" and found that in the COVID-19 world, the 24-hour update that doesn't stick to your profile ""lets us replace the water cooler conversations, which we all need from time to time.""

Explaining the change in focus, Roslansky says LinkedIn is a ""community where you can be inspired, build relationships and discover unexpected opportunities.""

Charlene Li, an analyst with the Altimeter Group, says adding Stories makes sense. ""People are not going to post baby photos there,"" she says. ""It's about work and how you want to be seen and known as a professional."" Stories, she says, ""are a great way to form connections, and that's what LinkedIn is all about.""

The cosmetic changes include more wide spaces, more colors and less of the ""LinkedIn"" blue, except for ""call to action,"" areas. The community has increased sharing of posts and articles by 50% since the COVID-19 crisis started this year.

LinkedIn added an ""Open to Work"" tab to help the suddenly laid-off employee find new gigs. LinkedIn says people who accept this notice receive 40% more LinkedIn mails from recruiters.

Search is being added to LinkedIn pages to find ""people, events, groups and content,"" and tabs are being added to LinkedIn messages to let people instantly connect to video meetings on Microsoft Teams, Zoom or Verizon's BlueJeans.

Asked about the resemblance to Facebook, Prasad says LinkedIn's goals are the same: to be a place for the business community to communicate. ""We try to get people to have conversations with each other, so they can get more opportunities.""

What makes it different from Facebook are the people on LinkedIn and the content they post. ""Even if you look at it visually and you say OK, well, they look very similar to each other ... I think the content and the network is actually the difference.""

LinkedIn's services are free, but there's a premium option, starting at $29.99 monthly, offering classes and the ability to write messages to people users aren't connected to.

DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is recalling more than 217,000 cars and SUVs in the U.S. and Canada because transmission oil can leak, causing them to stop moving or possibly catch fire.

The recall covers certain versions of the 2018 through 2020 Chevrolet Equinox and Traverse as well as the GMC Terrain. Also included are the 2018 Chevrolet Malibu and 2018 and 2019 Chevrolet Cruze and Buick LaCrosse, as well as the 2019 through 2020 Buick Encore and Enclave, the Cadillac XT4, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Blazer. The 2020 Cadillac XT6 also is covered.

GM says in government documents posted last weekend that two bolts may be missing from the stop-start mechanism, allowing the fluid to leak. The company says it has no reports of crashes, fires or injuries.

Dealers will inspect the mechanism and replace bolts if they're missing. The recall is expected to start Dec. 14.

Pfizer vaccine:How it could help lift economy out of COVID-19 pandemic rut

A Biden presidency:Tax cuts, health care and college debt priorities of first term"
318,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2020/11/09/pfizer-vaccine-coronavirus-covid-19-economy/6219512002/,How Pfizer vaccine could help lift economy out of COVID-19 pandemic rut,"The possibility that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate qualifies as a breakthrough is generating optimism that the economy could rebound swiftly in 2021 and beyond.

While Pfizer's vaccine still has multiple hurdles to surmount before it receives regulatory approval, hopes are rising for the airline industry, hotels, restaurants and retailers.

For effectively any business that has historically been done in person, optimism is surging. That could translate into job growth for millions of Americans who have lost their positions during the coronavirus pandemic.

Investors appeared positively giddy on Monday, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 1,550 points, or about 5.4%, and bolstering the S&P 500 Index by 3.8%.

""This is the news we've all been waiting for,"" Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote Monday morning in a research note. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel moment and just look at the reaction in the markets. One of incredible relief.""

Vaccine plans:Should employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine?

Image overhaul:Could a coronavirus vaccine rehab the pharmaceutical industry's reputation?

To be sure, any substantive economic relief is still at least months off, because it will take at least that long for the vaccine to win government approval, accelerate manufacturing and ramp up distribution.

""It’s clearly good news, as it will lift sentiment and stock prices, which should buoy consumer spending,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in an email. ""However, it doesn’t materially change the economy’s tough prospects over the next two-three months. The economy will continue to struggle with the intensifying pandemic and the lack of any support from lame-duck lawmakers.""

What's more, Pfizer's initial data – which suggests the vaccine may be more than 90% effective, putting it on par with the chickenpox inoculation – could be off. There's no guarantee that the vaccine will get across the finish line.

But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was ebullient in an interview Monday on CNBC.

""I believe this is likely the most significant medical advance in the last hundred years,"" he said.

Analysts who study the biotechnology industry were buoyant Monday.

Raymond James pharmaceutical industry analyst Steven Seedhouse pointed out that multiple other vaccines are also likely to work, given technological similarity with the Pfizer candidate.

""A return to 'normalcy' seems likely within 2021,"" Seedhouse wrote in a research note.

After a vaccine begins rolling out, the most immediate economic effects could include:

• Enabling restaurants to reopen or increase their seating capacity. Many restaurants have pivoted to takeout or delivery, but that hasn't been enough to replace the lost revenue from diners who have stayed away. Chains such as California Pizza Kitchen, Ruby Tuesday and Friendly's have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in recent months. And numerous small businesses have collapsed or been substantially weakened.

• Boosting foot traffic to struggling retailers. The vaccine won't arrive in time to help retailers during the critical holiday shopping season. But it could help restore consumer confidence in the economy and in the safety of shopping in person.

Several major retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in recent months, including J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J. Crew. In the early going, the pandemic forced many retailers to shutter their stores. Most stores have reopened, but many shoppers haven't returned.

""Investors are quite optimistic that foot traffic and sales for brick-and-mortar stores will quite quickly normalize once a critical mass of the population gets vaccinated,"" said Nick Shields, retail analyst at research firm Third Bridge.

But Shields cautioned that some retailers likely will remain hesitant to aggressively return to hiring, given the financial hit they've experienced since the pandemic began.

• Encouraging travelers to fly, stay in hotels or take cruises again. The airlines have been hobbled as air passengers have stayed away amid concerns about contracting the coronavirus while traveling. For the same reason, hotels have been emptied, and cruises have been anchored to shore.

• Reigniting the entertainment industry, including movie theaters, sports stadiums and theatrical performances. The entertainment sector has been hit hard, with Broadway temporarily shutting down, movie theaters shutting down or limiting capacity, and sports teams limiting or prohibiting fan attendance.

• Resuming office operations. Millions of Americans have been working remotely throughout the pandemic. Those arrangements could end soon after the vaccine gains momentum, although experts expect some companies to maintain remote work permanently.

For landlords facing rising vacancy rates because of retail closures and office shutdowns, that could spell relief. But it could also lead to a showdown between tenants and commercial real estate companies.

""A lot of tenants were not paying full rent because landlords wanted to keep their properties occupied so they gave all these rent concessions,"" Shields said. ""Once you do see a critical mass of the population get vaccinated, a lot of landlords will start to push their tenants for full rent.""

• Increasing gas prices. Petroleum companies have been ailing since the pandemic began as a result of declining economic activity and a drop-off in airline and car travel. But oil prices soared nearly 17% in early trading Monday after the Pfizer news, rising to more than $41 a barrel.

For consumers, though, that might mean rock-bottom gasoline prices could begin to fade. Gas prices had fallen for six consecutive weeks, according to fuel-savings app GasBuddy. But rising oil prices typically leads to an increase at the pump.

The Motley Fool

When you're planning how much income Social Security will provide, it's important you understand how much of your benefits you'll get to keep.

Unfortunately, many Americans make a big mistake in this regard because they assume their benefits won't be taxed due to the fact these are earned benefits received through the Social Security taxes on their wages throughout their careers.

Sadly, this mistakecould be very costly. Here's why.

Around 50% of retirees lose some of their benefits to taxes

The reality is, only about half of all retirees get to keep all of their Social Security money. And even fewer will pocket the full amount of their benefits in the future. That's because, as research from the Senior Citizens League shows, around 50% of beneficiaries are currently subject to federal tax on their benefits. And the number of people who are going to have to pay this tax is only growing.

Retiring soon?:Here are 3 ways to earn $3,895 in Social Security monthly benefits in 2021

COLA:Social Security cost-of-living increase to nudge up benefits 1.3% in 2021

Taxes kick in on Social Security once your provisional income reaches a certain threshold. And more people are soon going to have income above that threshold. That's becauseSocial Security benefits increase over time, not just because of cost of living adjustments (COLAs) but also because wages rise year over year for most people. Your Social Security benefit is based on your average earnings over your career. With average wages going up, benefits rise. And with incomes going up, usually this means you'll also have more money from a pension (if you receive one) and more money in your 401(k) to provide retirement income.

Unfortunately, although your combined annual income as a retiree may be rising, your buying power isn't necessarily going up. Because of inflation, $10 in 10 years won't buy you the same amount of goods as it does today. You'll need more money to maintain the same standard of living. So, if you're retiring in the future, you'll probably have a higher income than today's retirees because of wage growth, but your buying power may be around the same or less.

The big problem with that is, the threshold at which you're subject to tax on your benefits won't change. That means the Social Security benefits tax will apply to a growing number of low- and middle-income Americans rather than just the wealthiest retirees who used to be the only ones faced with an IRS bill.

Just how low are the thresholds for Social Security tax?

Under the Social Security rules, benefits are not taxed at all until your provisional income reaches $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for married joint filers. With income above this level, you're taxed on up to 50% of your Social Security. And if your income exceeds $34,000 for single filers or $44,000 for married joint filers, you'll be taxed on up to 85% of your benefits.

But provisional income isn'tall your income. It's all your taxable income, plus half your Social Security benefits plus some nontaxable income. That means if you make the average Social Security benefit of $1,543 per month in 2021, only $9,258 of your annual benefit would count toward your provisional income, and you could earn $15,472 in other countable income before owing taxes as a single filer.

But around half of all retirees are already above this threshold, and more will be every year as Americans retire with larger incomes due to wage growth. And while it's possible that these thresholds could change, it's unlikely since Social Security is already facing financial trouble and taxes on benefits serve as an important source of the program's income.

As you plan for retirement, you need to determine if you'll be subject to these taxes, as well as whether you'll be taxed on benefits in your state as well. If you'll owe the IRS or your state government, you need to budget accordingly and make sure you can live on what's left of your Social Security checks along with your savings.

He is the 12th player to win the by a unanimous vote.

Outfielder Luis Robert of the Chicago White Sox received 83 points followed by right-handed pitcher Cristian Javier of the Houston Astros, who tallied 11 points.

Lewis hit .262 with a .364 OBP, 11 home runs, 28 RBI and five steals in 58 games, becoming the first Seattle player to win the honor since Ichiro Suzuki in 2001.

The 25-year-old entered 2020 with high expectations after hitting six homers in 18 games in his September 2019 debut. Lewis got off to a flying start, batting .373 with a 1.031 OPS in his first 28 games but struggled in the second half of the shortened season, batting just .147 in September.

Lewis led all rookies in home runs (tied with Robert), runs (37) and walks (34).

NL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR:Historic season earns Brewers RP Devin Williams honors

The Mariners haven't reached the playoffs since 2001 – baseball's longest active drought – but Lewis and a handful of other young players have created some optimism in Seattle. The team finished third in the AL West with a 27-33 record this season and Lewis could soon be joined in the outfield by Jarred Kelenic, MLB.com's No. 9 overall prospect.

Lewis was the 11th overall pick in the 2016 MLB draft and won the Golden Spikes Award that year as the country's best amateur player. He suffered a torn ACL just 30 games into his first professional season, slowing his path to the majors.

Lewis is the fourth Mariner to win Rookie of the Year, joining Suzuki, Kazuhiro Sasaki (2000) and Alvin Davis (1984)."

Williams received 14 of 30 first-place ballots cast by the Baseball Writers' Association of America and finished with a total of 95 points. Philadelphia third baseman Alec Bohm was second with nine first-place votes and 74 points, with San Diego infielder Jake Cronenworth tallying six first-place votes to also total 74 points.

Los Angeles pitcher Tony Gonsolin, who was not among the three finalists, received the other first-place vote.

""I can't put it into words; it doesn't feel real right now, to be honest,"" Williams said on the announcement show on the MLB Network.

AL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR:Mariners outfielder Kyle Lewis unanimous choice for award

As for the journey to the majors after being selected in the second round of the 2013 draft and later undergoing Tommy John elbow surgery, Williams gave tribute to his mother: ""She's been my rock ever since I was a little baby boy. Her and my grandma and grandpa, they've always been there for me whenever I needed anything.

""She showed me to keep fighting, even when stuff doesn't go your way. You can't control that; you can only control how you react to it.""

Despite his dominance, Williams had two factors to overcome in the balloting: being a relief pitcher, and one not used to close games. No reliever had won a rookie of the year award since Craig Kimbrel for Atlanta in 2011, and no reliever ever had won in either league without recording at least one save.

""I'm glad to go first; that's good,"" he said.

Williams, 26, was brilliant in every sense of the word in evolving as the primary setup man for closer Josh Hader after a 13-appearance audition in 2019. Using a devastating mix of a high 90s (mph) fastball and knee-buckling changeup, he went 4-1 with a 0.33 earned run average in 22 appearances, allowing only one earned run – a home run by Pittsburgh’s Colin Moran in the fourth game of the season.

Williams began accumulating strikeouts at a dizzying pace, finishing with 53 in 27 innings for a historic ratio of 17.6 per nine innings. Beyond his ERA, he led all major-league relievers with a 0.63 WHIP and .090 opponents batting average.

Many considered Williams’ changeup, which was given the nickname “Airbender,” the most dominant pitch in the majors, a high-spin, tumbling offering that broke in similar fashion to a breaking ball from a left-handed pitcher. Hitters went 2 for 62 (.032) against it with 41 strikeouts.

Unfortunately for Williams and the Brewers, he developed shoulder soreness after his last outing of the season in St. Louis – his third consecutive two-inning outing – and he was unavailable to pitch in the wild-card series in Los Angeles, won by the eventual champion Dodgers in two games.

Williams’ dominance earned him NL reliever of the year honors, succeeding Hader, who had won it the previous two seasons. He became the third rookie of the year in Brewers history, as selected by the BBWAA, with shortstop Pat Listach winning in the American League in 1992 and third baseman Ryan Braun (who later moved to the outfield) in the NL in 2007.

Bohm, 24, who didn’t come to the majors until a couple of weeks into the season, batted .338 in 44 games with a .400 on-base percentage, four home runs, 23 runs batted in and .881 OPS. He drew 16 walks, struck out only 36 times and was a clutch performer for the Phillies, batting .452 with runners in scoring position.

Though he played in 10 less games than the left-handed-hitting Cronenworth, Bohm had only 12 fewer plate appearances (180). He had a 1.2 WAR, compared to 1.4 for Cronenworth, and 136 OPS+, just higher than Cronenworth’s 128.

Cronenworth, 26, who started games at second base, where he was a Gold Glove finalist, nine at first base and three at shortstop, batted .285 with four home runs, 20 RBI and .831 OPS. He got off to a blazing start in August, compiling a 1.021 OPS, before falling off badly in September (.543, including a .183 batting average)."
323,2020-11-09 00:00:00,https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2020/11/09/2020-masters-weather-augusta-national/,How will the weather affect the 2020 Masters?,"Temperature forecasts for the mid-70s to low 80s this week should make this November’s Masters feel like April, ending months of conjecture and speculation by players, fans and the media about playing Augusta National Golf Club in the cold.

Since Augusta National chairman Fred S. Ridley announced this year’s rescheduled dates due to COVID-19, golfers have shared their experiences playing the course in the fall.

From champions like Tiger Woods, who said he would play in the fall in years when there were extensive course changes, to rookie Sebastian Muñoz, who said he canceled his round last November due to a change in temperatures overnight, players offered their thoughts.

Masters: How to stream, watch on TV | Tiger’s history at Augusta

“I have played there in November,” Woods said at October’s Zozo Championship. “And the few times that I have played in November, it’s been the same. It’s been cold, ball doesn’t go very far.”

Aiken’s Kevin Kisner and Augusta State alumnus Patrick Reed both predicted the course would play longer in cooler temperatures and wetter weather.

What are the normal Masters temperatures?

Of the roughly 335 days tournament golf has been played in Augusta, more than 60 percent of those have had a high temperature between 70 and 85 degrees, according to data from the National Weather Service. But there have been rounds in the extremes that affect how the course plays.

Horton Smith won the inaugural tournament in March 1934 with a high temperature of 47, while the overnight low for the first round of Zach Johnson’s 2007 triumph was 26 degrees.

The most common temperature in Augusta on days when Masters rounds have been played is 79 degrees. Friday’s forecast for that temperature would be the 23rd round in Masters history at that number.

So, this is an unusual November?

Besides playing the Masters? Not really, in terms of high temperatures. Over the past 10 years, the highs in Augusta during these same days mostly have been between 60 and 80 degrees.

The biggest difference in this year’s forecast is in the overnight lows. The predictions for this week, according to Accuweather, are supposed to be in the 60s and 70s.

In the last decade, the November lows have ranged from the low 30s to the upper 50s, creating temperature differences of 30 degrees or more from early morning to late afternoon.

That would have created a sharp difference in playing conditions for golfers teeing off on the second nine and facing Amen Corner early Thursday or Friday morning.

Isn’t there rain in the forecast?

Storms and showers are in the forecast for Wednesday and Thursday this week, adding to players’ projections for a longer course due to wetter conditions.

It has rained during 44 Masters tournaments — from single-day showers that didn’t interrupt play to long delays and even full-day washouts like the one in 1973 that led to a Masters first — threesomes with a two-tee start.

There have been 30 Masters rounds delayed or postponed because of weather or darkness – an residual effect of players impacted by the weather.

What about the wind?

Veteran players look at the flags atop the main scoreboard to see which direction the wind is blowing from the first tee.

Forecasts for this week at windfinder.com show shifting winds from the northeast to the northwest of 2-3 mph for Thursday followed by mostly northwest winds with gusts up to 20 mph the rest of the tournament.

“If you’re able to get the north wind that time of year, it can be awfully difficult and long and very different than what we normally play in April,” Woods said in October, a sentiment echoed by Reed and Kisner.

“So every year in November, I hit 4-iron into No. 1 because it plays into the wind and there’s no roll,” Kisner said.

But a northwest wind has proven helpful to the shorter hitters in the past by leveling the playing field against the long bombers.

“You’ve got some of the longer holes down breeze and you’ve also neutralized the par 5s on the back nine at 13 and 15,” Furyk told The Augusta Chronicle in 2010. “(The wind) neutralizes the field a little bit and it gives (short to medium hitters) an advantage.”

The proof Furyk said, is provided by Mike Weir in 2003 and Zach Johnson in 2007. Both are medium-length hitters who have trouble reaching the par 5s in two at Augusta National even under the most favorable wind conditions, Furyk said.

And the tropical weather in the news?

The path of Tropical Storm Eta is still too early to predict, although it is expected to be off the west coast of Florida on Friday.

Strong winds and hurricanes been have part of the Masters since the beginning. Hotel financier J. Perry Stolz’s plans to demolish the old farmhouse at the Berckmans property were ended when a devastating hurricane wiped out Miami in 1926.

Stolz’s finances were ruined and Fruitland Nurseries went back on the market, where Bobby Jones found it as the spot to build his ideal course."

Garrett Gilbert, who started in Dallas’ 24-19 Sunday loss to the Steelers, would be their second option should Dalton not clear concussion and COVID-19 reserve protocols. Veteran journeyman Cooper Rush ranks as their third.

But amid a five-week stretch with four different starters, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones offered a glimmer of good news about the team’s quarterback luck.

Five-year starter Dak Prescott, who suffered a compound fracture and dislocation of his right ankle on Oct 11, is ahead of his recovery schedule.

“He’s been able to avoid any setbacks,” Jones said when asked if Prescott had avoided infection akin to what Washington quarterback Alex Smith battled back from. “If anything, he’s ahead of schedule—which shouldn’t be surprising, the way he goes after every challenge.

“It’s full speed ahead with Dak, and he’s done a great job to this point.”

WEEK 9 WINNERS, LOSERS:Seattle Seahawks' defense might be team's undoing

Prescott suffered the fracture and dislocation in the third quarter of a Week 5 matchup with the Giants. After a designed run went awry, Prescott was splinted and carted off the field and into a waiting ambulance. He underwent emergency surgery to clean and repair the wound that night and was discharged from the hospital the following day.

He has rehabbed intermittently at the Star, encouraging the revolving door of quarterbacks that has since followed him in Dallas games.

Prescott’s timeline for recovery was set at four months, a mark Jones said he’s on pace to challenge. The team hopes he’ll be ready for offseason work ahead of a 2021 season, in which the Cowboys must decide whether and through what means to re-sign him.

Before his injury, Prescott started 72 straight games, including postseason appearances, for the franchise. He hadn’t missed a contest since Dallas selected him in the fourth round, 135th overall, of the 2016 NFL draft.

Prescott threw for 1,856 yards and nine touchdowns to four interceptions in just four and a half games this season. He scored three rushing touchdowns and one receiving score. Prescott also set NFL records as he passed for at least 450 yards in each of three complete games preceding his injury.

Prescott signed a $31.4 million franchise tender for the 2020 NFL season when he and the Cowboys failed to reach a long-term agreement before the July 15 deadline. Both sides have publicly maintained they want to stay together for the future. No formal negotiations can commence until the season concludes. Jones said Monday that management has conversed sparingly with Prescott since his Oct. 11 injury. He dismissed the notion that Dallas would consider 2021 quarterback prospects even as the 2-7 team looks destined for a high draft slot

“Dak’s our quarterback and we’re so fired up about him and him leading us in the future,” Jones said. “Like I said, we’re focused week to week right now on getting better each week.

Five days after the former first-round pick criticized the organization on Twitter for not moving him at the trade deadline, the Falcons on Monday announced they had waived the pass rusher.

McKinley wrote last Wednesday that he requested to be traded in 2019, claiming that the team had turned down a second-round pick. He said the Falcons rebuffed multiple offers of fifth- and sixth-round selections this year. McKinley then tweeted three clown emoji.

Falcons interim coach Raheem Morris said last week that McKinley had handled the situation inappropriately and that the team would weigh its options.

""Takk will definitely be held accountable for his actions, and everything that goes along with it,"" Morris said. ""That's with missing whatever he missed today, and all the things that he has missed in the past.""

McKinley, 25, was the No. 26 overall pick out of UCLA in the 2017 NFL draft. The Falcons opted not to pick up his fifth-year option prior to this season, and a groin injury limited him to just four games in 2020. He has recorded just 17 1/2 sacks in three and a half years."

The Michigan State athletic department announced the Hall of Fame men's basketball coach tested positive Monday morning with a daily antigen test. A PCR test confirmed the presumptive positive.

Izzo, 65, has been outspoken and one of the state's biggest proponents for wearing a mask, helping Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the state spread the message since April.

“This morning I tested positive for COVID-19. Although I have some minor symptoms, I remain in good health,"" Izzo said in a statement. ""I’ve been extremely diligent for many months now, wearing my mask in public and around the office, while adhering to social distancing guidelines. I’ve been racking my brain, trying to figure out if there was a time where I let my guard down for just an instance. And while I haven’t identified any area of exposure, what I have determined is that this shows the power of the virus. You’d be hard pressed to find a coach who’s taken more precautions than I have, following all the protocols put in place by our medical team, and yet I still contracted the virus.""

No other members of the MSU basketball program have tested positive since Big Ten daily antigen testing began on Oct. 26, Izzo tested negative each time until Monday morning, according to the school.

During Izzo’s isolation, associate head coach Dwayne Stephens will run practices. Stephens' father, Dwayne Stephens Sr., died April 1 after contracting COVID-19.

Izzo will undergo a 10-day isolation period, and he can return at the earliest Nov. 17 according to CDC and Big Ten guidelines. His symptoms began Saturday, per the athletic department release.

“Technology will allow me to stay connected with my staff and our players, and I’ll have plenty of time to watch film.

I’m proof that no one is immune, but I still believe that there are steps everyone can take to reduce their chances of contracting the virus.”

Last week, Oakland men's basketball coach Greg Kampe and women's basketball coach Jeff Tungate were among several positive tests within the Golden Grizzlies athletic community.

For The Win

In a way, it was fitting. Inarguably one of the greatest in the history of NASCAR, Jimmie Johnson closed his full-time racing career in front of a sparse crowd. Only 11,000 people were allowed in the grandstands that generally hold 45,000 at Phoenix Raceway.

COVID-19 restrictions robbed Johnson — who is tied for the most Cup Series championships ever with seven — of a boisterous appreciation, as his farewell tour was muted throughout the year by the pandemic. But that only fits with the theme for Johnson, who many around the sport believe never got the admiration he deserved.

“To be honest with you, I have been sad about that for Jimmie because I’ve always felt that we never really appreciated Jimmie in the moment,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said.

“He’s a living legend doing all those things right there in front of us, and I don’t think we ever really, as an industry, appreciated how good he was, what he did. Five championships in a row is just crazy.”

Johnson, 45, would never say so himself — he’s far too humble, and his peers will tell you that — but he deserved better. I’ve already weighed in on where the No. 48 Chevrolet driver belongs in the NASCAR GOAT debate. His stats already put him up there with 83 wins, ranking him No. 6 on NASCAR’s all-time wins list.

“Jimmie Johnson is the greatest driver in my era, and my era started in 1972,” said NASCAR Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip, who’s one spot above Johnson with 84 wins.

Comparing Johnson with the other two seven-time champions, Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Sr., Waltrip more or less separates Petty and Johnson into two different categories.

“I never thought I’d see anybody win seven championships again,” Waltrip continued. “Obviously, Earnhardt was great. [Jeff] Gordon’s great. [David] Pearson was there. There were other great drivers, but no one accomplished what Jimmie Johnson has done in that period of time.”

Waltrip is referring to Johnson’s unfathomable five consecutive championships from the 2006 to 2010 seasons. That’s a level of dominance NASCAR had never seen, and it’s unlikely another driver will ever match that mark — especially since NASCAR switched to a more traditional-style playoff format that creates added opportunity for upsets. Johnson also won the title in 2013 and 2016.

(Story continues after gallery)

In any other year, Johnson’s retirement would have been a season-long celebration with packed grandstands cheering and showing their love for the seven-time champ during his last full season.

“It’s a shame,” said Tony Stewart, a three-time Cup Series champion who retired in 2016. “The accolades and the acknowledgement from the fans and tracks the last half of the season, I think that’s something that’s meant a lot to me, and I think it would mean a lot to him too. And unfortunately, [he’s] not going to get that.

“I feel like the biggest disappointment this year in motor sports is that we’ve got a seven-time champion that’s retiring [and] didn’t get what I feel like is a proper, fitting sendoff for everything that he’s done in the sport.”

Of course, Johnson, his career and his family have been celebrated this year.

Before the coronavirus shut down sports in the U.S., his wife, Chandra, and his daughters, Genevieve and Lydia, waved the green flag in March at Auto Club Speedway, Johnson’s “home” southern California track. His father, Gary, gave the “start your engines” command a few weeks ago at Texas Motor Speedway, where Jimmie is the all-time winningest driver with seven victories.

Plenty of gifts were still given as well. And it seems like nearly every track named something after Johnson, like Homestead-Miami Speedway’s Turn 3 tunnel, which is now named Jimmie Johnson’s Southernmost Tunnel.

But the subdued celebrations throughout the season didn’t remotely resemble the massive tributes drivers like Dale Jr., Gordon or Stewart received during their final seasons before retirement.

Despite his loyal fan base and ample success, it’s clear that Johnson is underappreciated by huge swaths of NASCAR fans. They just didn’t latch onto him, and he was never voted most popular driver (though, that could still change for 2020).

Maybe it was because he’s from southern California, a long way from the heart of NASCAR country. Maybe it’s because he wasn’t a bully on the track, or an agitator. He was booed for winning too much and labeled boring and vanilla.

Petty and Earnhardt were admired for their steely reserve and the feeling that they’d run anybody off the track to win. Maybe Johnson, as I wrote last week, always seemed like a driver who felt lucky just to be able to race cars for a living — and then happened to win a lot.

Maybe all of the above.

(Story continues after gallery)

Dale Jr., NASCAR’s 15-time most popular driver, said he felt apologetic over it because “the fans don’t embrace [Johnson] more in masses.”

“Always felt that way,” Earnhardt said. “And then this year, I thought, ‘Man, he’s finally going to feel that love and appreciation from stop to stop along the tour.’ And it didn’t happen.”

And inexplicably, it feels like Johnson is an afterthought among champions.

“When they say, ‘Seven-time champion,’ they say, ‘Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty.’ And then they’re like, ‘Oh, and Jimmie Johnson.’ It’s like what?” Bubba Wallace said at the beginning of the season. “I guess that’s just Jimmie’s persona. He’s cool, calm and collected and under the radar.”

Stewart agrees, calling Johnson “one of the most underappreciated NASCAR champions that we’ve ever seen.” He’s baffled by it and believes Johnson doesn’t get nearly enough credit.

So it goes and has gone for Johnson. Maybe fans’ appreciations for him will grow now that he’s retired from full-time racing and will be missing from NASCAR in 2021.

“All I guess we can do is hope that he feels that appreciation,” Dale Jr. said.

“We’ll try to do a really good job of making sure he understands his impact on the sport. But I don’t know how you make a guy understand that anyways because it’s been so profound.”"
328,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/11/09/jeff-luhnow-lawsuit-claims-firing-saved-astros-world-series-title/6226683002/,Former Astros GM's lawsuit claims firing part of deal to save team's World Series title,"Former Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow filed a civil lawsuit Monday against his old team, alleging that Major League Baseball’s investigation into the sign-stealing scandal that cost him his job was a “negotiated resolution” between the league and Astros owner Jim Crane that ensured Luhnow would be fired and the team would retain its tainted 2017 World Series title.

Luhnow received a one-year suspension from MLB on Jan. 13, upon conclusion of its investigation, and was fired later that day by Crane. Now, his suspension served, Luhnow is seeking the $22 million that remained on his contract from the franchise that, he claims in his legal filing, he “transformed from the worst team in Major League Baseball to one of the best in less than a decade.”

MLB and the Astros both declined comment on the suit.

Luhnow’s well-documented teardown and buildup of the Astros – who lost at least 106 games in three consecutive seasons, two under his watch beginning in 2012 – resulted in a 2017 World Series championship, three consecutive American League West titles and a 2019 AL pennant.

Luhnow’s hyper-efficient management doctrine spread to other franchises and even to MLB’s central office. Yet Luhnow turned from visionary to villain just weeks after the 2019 World Series, when The Athletic first reported that the Astros’ 2017 championship was won while an elaborate and illegal electronic sign-stealing scandal was executed in the bowels of Minute Maid Park.

MLB’s investigation launched soon thereafter and found Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch failed to properly inform staff and players of league mandates against illegal sign-stealing. The league also claimed Luhnow, in acknowledging emails from lower-level staffers, had direct knowledge of the scheme – which involved illegally viewing a TV monitor and banging on a trash can to pass on opposing teams’ signs.

FREE AGENCY PREVIEW:Ranking the 81 best players in the 2020-2021 class

Luhnow’s lawsuit, filed in Harris County District Court, paints a different picture: That MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and Crane – who hired Luhnow in December 2011 – reached an agreement that would absolve Crane of responsibility while ensuring Luhnow took the fall.

“MLB’s ‘investigation,’ ’” Luhnow’s claim says, “actually was a negotiated resolution between Astros owner Jim Crane and MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred that enabled the team to keep its World Series championship, went to great lengths to exonerate Crane and scapegoated Luhnow for a sign-stealing scandal that he had no knowledge of and played no part in.”

The lawsuit provides no evidence of an agreement between Manfred and Crane to salvage the team's World Series title.

Luhnow’s lawsuit comes days after Hinch – suspended and fired the same day as Luhnow – was hired to manage the Detroit Tigers. Additionally, the Boston Red Sox re-hired manager Alex Cora, with whom they parted ways two days after his role in the sign-stealing scandal as Astros bench coach was revealed.

Luhnow’s future in the game is far murkier. His lawsuit, then, pulls few punches.

It insists that no credible evidence exists of Luhnow’s knowledge of the scheme, and that despite interviewing 68 witnesses and reviewing voluminous electronic communications, “produced only one untrustworthy source – the actual ringleader of the Astros’ sign-stealing schemes who ‘implicated’ Luhnow to save his own job.”

That would be Tom Koch-Weser, the team's director of advance information who remains employed by the club. Luhnow’s suit berates MLB for failing to reference, in its report, any of the 22,000 text messages sent and received by Koch-Weser – messages it claims do not reference Luhnow.

The suit claims the Astros told Koch-Weser he’d keep his job “so long as his actions were sanctioned by his supervisors, including Luhnow,” and that Koch-Weser’s testimony to MLB that Luhnow had knowledge of the scheme remain uncorroborated.

Luhnow claims Manfred “ignored his findings that the players and video room staff – not the Astros’ front office – were responsible for the sign-stealing schemes. That is because the commissioner vetted potential penalties with Crane, and the two exchanged a series of proposals.”

MLB fined Crane $5 million and stripped the club of four draft picks but allowed the Astros to retain their title.

“I don’t think I should be held accountable,” Crane said in February, when Astros players apologized for their role in the scheme on the first day of spring training.

Crane was certainly emboldened by MLB’s report, which noted that “our investigation revealed absolutely no evidence that Jim Crane, the owner of the Astros, was aware of any of the conduct described in this report. Crane is extraordinarily troubled and upset by the conduct of members of his organization, fully supported my investigation, and provided unfettered access to any and all information requested.”

Ultimately, Luhnow said he believes his termination was without cause; of the four conditions that would justify a firing with cause in Luhnow’s contract, it’s likely the Astros would contend Luhnow was fired for “any material failure or refusal of the Employee to follow the material, lawful instructions of the club relating to his duties.”"

Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the MLB commissioner from 1920 to '44 who prevented the game from being integrated during his reign, will no longer have his name on the MVP awards following a resounding vote by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America.

There wasn’t enough time for the writers to vote on a new name to be attached to the awards this year, with Jose Ramirez of Cleveland and Freddie Freeman of Atlanta favored to be named the winners Thursday in the American and National leagues, but there’s a perfect option out there starting next year.

Josh Gibson, perhaps the greatest slugger of 'em all.

Gibson never played in Major League Baseball because of Landis, so wouldn’t it be appropriate that the greatest player Landis denied would now represent baseball’s best annual players?

“I think that’s a spectacular idea,’’ said Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, whose father played with Gibson in the Negro Leagues, told USA TODAY Sports. “It’s such a tremendous award, but for it to be called the Josh Gibson award would really make a significant difference.

“I can’t think of a better guy to name it after.’’

Jackson, who like Gibson grew up in Pennsylvania, knew all about Gibson’s feats from listening to stories from his father. Gibson hit 800 home runs in the Negro Leagues, maybe even more, with a career .359 batting average. He won nine home run titles and four batting titles for the Pittsburgh Crawfords and Homestead Grays. He was easily considered the greatest power-hitting catcher in major league history, once hitting a 580-foot homer in Yankee Stadium, legend has it.

AWARDS SEASON:Finalists for MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and other awards announced

“Josh was a better power hitter than Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, or anybody else I’ve ever seen,’’ the late Cleveland Buckeyes manager Alonzo Boone said.

Hall of Famer Satchel Paige simply said: “He was the greatest hitter who ever lived.""

Gibson, widely considered the greatest player to never play in Major League Baseball, died of a brain tumor at the age of 35, just three months before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier on April 15, 1947.

He was inducted into the Hall of Fame 15 years after his death.

“You sit back and hear those Josh Gibson stories,’’ Jackson said. “It would be, 'Satchel Paige struck out the side that day, and Gibson would hit two more home runs.’ Having Josh Gibson on that plaque would bring great recognition to the Negro Leagues.’’

The BBWAA, with 89% of the voting body approving to remove Landis’ name, likely will vote next summer on a replacement.

The Gibson family is now hoping the writers do the right thing.

“It’s an honor to be even be considered,’’ said Sean Gibson, 52, Josh Gibson’s great grandson, who runs the Josh Gibson Foundation in Pittsburgh. “It would be more of a redemption, a poetic justice-type story. The guy who denied all of the opportunities to African-American players to play Major League Baseball would be replaced by the guy that he denied.’’

There’s little question that Gibson would have been a huge star, a multi-MVP winner, if he played in the major leagues. Even Time Magazine wrote about Gibson’s historical feats, saying he would have been the most famous player in baseball. Once baseball integrated, 11 of the next 16 MVP awards in the National League went to Black players.

Williams, in the summer of 1966, then opened the door for baseball immortality by campaigning for the greatest Negro League players to be inducted into Cooperstown during his Hall of Fame speech.

“I hope that someday the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way,’’ Williams said, “could be added as a symbol of the great Negro players that are not here only because they were not given the chance.""

It was groundbreaking, and five years later Paige became the first Negro League player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame with Gibson joining a year after.

“My grandfather, Josh Gibson Jr., would always talk about Ted Williams’ speech,’’ Sean Gibson said. “He always thanked Ted Williams for that. If not for that speech, who knows what would have happened?""

And, if not for a country being woke this summer, who knows how long Landis’ name would have remained on the MVP plaque?

Now, Landis’ name is erased from the plaque, and Gibson’s is the perfect replacement.

This is a man who was legendary on the field, and off it, still raised two kids on his own after his wife dying during delivery of twins, while dealing with the everyday hatred of racism.

“The way we look at it,’’ Sean Gibson said, “the MVP won’t stand for Josh Gibson, but it would stand for all of the great players who were denied. It would stand for Cool Papa Bell, Oscar Charleston, Buck Leonard, Turkey Stearnes, Ray Dandridge, and all of the families of great Negro League players denied of this opportunity.

“This would be a great honor, right next to being inducted into the Hall of Fame, carrying his legacy forever.""

Let this be the final time there is no name on these plaques.

And, beginning in 2021, let it forever be known as the annual Josh Gibson MVP awards."

""The Steelers were informed this morning that a player has tested positive for COVID-19,"" Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said Monday in a statement. ""The player was immediately self-quarantined, and the organization continues to be in the NFL's intensive protocol. We have been in contact with the NFL and medical advisors to complete the necessary contact tracing. The player will be placed on the team's Reserve/COVID-19 list today.

""The health and safety of our players, coaches and staff members remain our highest priority.""

About half an hour after the team made the announcement, the NFL's transaction wire showed that the team had placed tight end Vance McDonald on the Reserve/COVID-19 list.

MORE:32 things we learned from Week 9 of the 2020 NFL season

McDonald made an appearance Friday on the team's final injury report before Sunday's game with an illness designation. The Steelers listed McDonald as questionable despite his not participating in practice on Friday.

The Steelers toppled the Cowboys, 24-19, Sunday and remained undefeated at a perfect 8-0. McDonald played 20 offensive snaps and caught one pass for 2 yards.

Pittsburgh is set to host the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday. There has been no indication thus far that the NFL was considering a schedule change.

The league has been reluctant to cancel or postpone games even after teams have reported positive COVID-19 tests to players, coaches and staff members in the days or weeks before the games are played.

The Steelers have already had their schedule impacted this season because of the pandemic, after an outbreak at the Tennessee Titans forced Pittsburgh's game that had been scheduled against them in Week 4 to be moved to Week 7. That change also meant that the Steelers were forced to take their bye on Week 4, something quarterback Ben Roethlisberger characterized as Pittsburgh getting ""the short end of the stick.""

Because of that, the NFL now has less flexibility in terms of rescheduling a game in the Steelers' schedule if a significant outbreak comes out of this positive test. The league has pushed back several games this year after teams reported positive cases.

McDonald has caught nine passes for 61 yards so far this season."

Sure, the veteran player has been an endangered species for several years now. Clubs disinclined to compete have slowed the market, though now there are more takers than there are tankers.

And the labor war that’s been brewing for years doesn’t officially settle in until next December, when the current collective bargaining agreement expires.

Yet the effects of the novel coronavirus that cut the 2020 season down to 60 games will impact off-season movement far beyond the mere act of cancelling December’s winter meetings. Losses estimated in the multi-billions by MLB aren’t nearly as daunting as unpredictive revenues in 2021, when no or partial attendance is expected, in addition to potentially permanent changes in fan behavior.

USA TODAY Sports’ ranking of the top free agents available is even more volatile than ever, what with dozens more players likely hitting the market in December after they are non-tendered. The market will likely move in fits and starts, some veterans leaping at early offers to ensure a job, dozens of others likely not hearing the phone ring until the new year.

It’s all exacerbated by a class short on elite players, clouding the concept of “market value” once you get past the top dozen or so. With that, here’s a look at our top 81 free agents available, from the very elite to those with a reasonable shot at landing a major league contract. Rankings based on projected future performance and perceived market value:

(Age as of April 1, 2021; 2020 team)

***

1. George Springer (31, OF, Astros): He salvaged a rough start to the shortened season to reach his usual levels in on-base percentage (.359) and OPS (.899), then proved Playoff George is real by hitting four homers and driving in 10 runs, all away from Minute Maid Park. He’s on the old end for a first-time free agent, and his future is likely at a corner outfield spot, but he’s the best option for instant and consistent offense and should receive a nine-figure deal.

2. Trevor Bauer (30, RHP, Reds): Every facet of Bauer’s career has been unique and free agency should be no different, evidenced by his social media charm campaign even before the playoffs ended. Bauer has gone from curiosity to innovator to, now, the best pitcher on the market after leading the NL in ERA (1.73), hits per nine (5.1) and adjusted ERA (276).

3. J.T. Realmuto (30, C, Phillies): The Phillies gave up a No. 1 starter to acquire him. The Nationals have long wanted him. The Mets tried dealing for him two years ago and now have a deep-pocketed owner itchy to make a splash. Yes, in the NL East alone, there’s a significant market for Realmuto, whose receiving ability, on-base acumen and leadership qualities will combine to make him the richest catcher ever in free agency.

4. DJ LeMahieu (31, 2B, Yankees): That he only received a two-year, $ 24 million contract in his last free agent go-round is more an indictment of the market two years ago than LeMahieu’s skills. Since then, he’s become the most valuable player on the richest team in baseball and the only player in the modern era to win a batting title in both leagues. The Yankees will have to dig deeper this time if they want to retain him.

5. Marcus Semien (30, SS, Athletics): An interesting test case for what matters more: The recent but limited-sample 60-game season or a 2019 campaign that saw Semien finish third in the AL MVP race thanks to 33 home runs and an .892 OPS. He batted .223 in 2020 and his adjusted OPS fell from 139 to 91. Yet Semien represents a strong, more economic alternative to the epic 2021 shortstop class (Javy Baez, Francisco Lindor, Corey Seager, Trevor Story, Carlos Correa), providing stability up the middle and atop a batting order.

6. Marcus Stroman (29, RHP, Mets): Stroman did not pitch this season after suffering a calf injury and then opting out of the remainder of the season Aug. 10, leaving a strong if uneven track record for suitors to evaluate. Stroman is a fierce competitor capable of suppressing the home-run ball (0.8 per nine innings in his career) and posted adjusted ERAs of 145 and 137 in 2017 and ’19, two of the roughest pitching environments this century. While shy of No. 1 starter status, he’s surpassed 200 innings twice in his career and still has upside.

7. Marcell Ozuna (30, OF, Braves): A monster 2020, including playoffs, and the lack of a qualifying offer ensures this free agency will be much more lucrative for Ozuna. He led the NL in homers (18), RBI (56) and total bases (145) while batting .338; he followed that up by driving in nine runs in the NLDS and NLCS, regaining his status as a feared middle-of-the-lineup presence. With the permanent DH lurking and no draft-pick compensation required to sign him, Ozuna will greatly exceed the one-year, $18 million pact the Braves gave him a year ago.

8. Justin Turner (36, 3B, Dodgers): The Dodgers guaranteed him $64 million over four years after 2016, and he repaid them in kind, with two top-15 MVP seasons, an All-Star campaign and a 2020 season in which he slashed .307/.400/.460 and helped them to a World Series title. Though he exhibited dubious judgment in appearing on the field after a positive COVID-19 test during Game 6, Turner remains a valued clubhouse leader, gifted defensively and should be worth a strong short-term investment for a contending club – perhaps even back in L.A.

9. Masahiro Tanaka (32, RHP, Yankees): There’s not many Yankees out there less appreciated than Tanaka, who was rarely spectacular yet highly dependable in seven seasons in the Bronx. The two-time All-Star posted a career 3.74 ERA that dipped to 3.33, including a 0.98 WHIP, in 10 playoff starts. If nothing else, the pitching-poor Yankees badly need him back, lest they put too much faith in young starters Deivi Garcia, Jordan Montgomery and Clarke Schmidt to fill the void behind Gerrit Cole. But they did not extend Tanaka a qualifying offer, which enhances his value on the open market.

10. Nelson Cruz (40, DH, Twins): It appears Cruz will let us know when he’s done. He hit 57 home runs in 173 games with Minnesota, proving no park is too big for him, and could see the market open up for him with the universal DH on the horizon. His .876 career OPS ranks 15th among active players.

11. Michael Brantley (33, OF, Astros): They call him Dr. Smooth, but Ageless Raker might be more apropos at this point. He’s roared into his 30s, with four seasons in which his batting average landed between .299 and .311 and his OPS ranged from .801 to .875, while never striking out more than 66 times. Those skills are far harder to come by in this three-true outcomes era, and a playoff contender will bet at least three years that he’ll keep it up.

12. Liam Hendriks (32, RHP, Athletics): The fearless Aussie has the stuff and the flexibility to meet any modern team’s relief needs. Hendriks converted 39 of 46 save opportunities the past two seasons, with his strikeouts per nine innings (13.1) and strikeout-walk ratio (12.3) hitting elite levels in 2020.

13. Andrelton Simmons (31, SS, Angels): He won a pair of Gold Gloves and was an above-average offensive performer in 2017-18, but regressed more toward an all-field, adequate-bat guy the past two seasons. Simmons went homerless this season in 118 at-bats before opting out in the season’s final week. Still a special defender, but with so many total packages at the position, he’ll fall short of a massive payday.

14. Didi Gregorius (31, SS, Phillies): Few have navigated the one-year “pillow contract” game better than Gregorius, who played in all 60 games, posted a career high in OBP (.339) and hit 10 home runs, equaling the output of Trevor Story, Dansby Swanson and Tim Anderson. He will have a nice, multiyear landing somewhere.

15. Charlie Morton (37, RHP, Rays): With his $15 million option from the hometown Rays declined, Morton will consider whether to play in 2021, though there will be ample suitors for one of the most respected pitchers in the game. Morton could not match his Cy Young-caliber 2019 campaign, missing some time with a shoulder injury, but went 3-0 against the Yankees and Astros in the playoffs.

16. Kevin Gausman (30, RHP, Giants): He’ll be a fascinating case study among free agents after a strong season of reinvention with the Giants, for whom he posted a 1.11 WHIP and struck out 79 in 59 2/3 innings; they surprisingly tendered him the $18.9 million qualifying offer. Be it as a starter, “bulk” pitcher or some combo in between, Gausman remains a potentially dominant force when deployed properly.

17. Joc Pederson (28, OF, Dodgers): Pederson salvaged a grim season with yet another fantastic playoff, going 11 for 28 (.393) with two big home runs in the NLCS and World Series. Just one year removed from a 36-homer season, Pederson is best enjoyed as the lefty half of a platoon (he’s .191/.266/.310 lifetime against lefties) and could be a powerful addition to a contender.

18. Jon Lester (37, LHP, Cubs): Who says long-term deals for pitchers don’t work out? Lester’s six-year, $155 million pact with the Cubs saw him win 77 games and post a 3.64 ERA over 1,002 innings, not including that little run to the 2016 World Series. He was hit harder in 12 2020 starts, giving up a career-high 1.6 homers per nine innings with a 5.16 ERA. But he retains significant value as a back-end guy for a contending team, a lefty who missed virtually no starts in six years with Chicago.

19. James McCann (30, C, White Sox): Nudged aside for Yasmani Grandal behind the plate, McCann’s seven home runs in 97 at-bats nearly equaled Grandal’s eight in 161. A 2019 All-Star, McCann’s off-season pitch framing work resulted in him cracking the top 10 in Statcast’s catcher framing leaderboard. An attractive right-handed piece of a catching timeshare.

20. Jackie Bradley Jr. (30, CF, Red Sox): Always an elite defender, Bradley picked a fine year to post career highs in batting average (.283) and OBP (.364). His value will always lie in his ability to go get the ball; only Kevin Kiermaier and Lorenzo Cain grade higher over the past three years than Bradley among center fielders in FanGraph’s overall defensive rating.

21. Adam Wainwright (39, RHP, Cardinals): He’ll turn 40 before next year’s playoffs, rendering him little more than a hired gun in 2021, yet a startling 2020 renaissance should have plenty of contenders seeking his services. Wainwright’s two complete games (one of seven innings) were tops in the NL, and his 1.05 WHIP and 137 adjusted ERA were his best since 2014, when he finished third in Cy Young voting. A return to the Cardinals makes sense, as would a return to the Braves, who drafted him in 2000. Twenty years later, Waino can still stabilize a staff.

22. Alex Colomé (32, RHP, White Sox): Colome doesn’t miss many bats for a closer – just 16 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings this year – but that doesn’t stop him from locking down the ninth inning. He’s converted 101 of 116 save chances the past four years, an 87% conversion rate that will endear him to clubs that still prefer a more traditional bullpen setup.

23. Tommy La Stella (32, 2B, Athletics): A defensively versatile, on-base machine is always in demand, and La Stella reached at a .370 clip for the Angels and A’s this season.

24. James Paxton (32, LHP, Yankees): Yet another mystery item, as agent Scott Boras has said Paxton is back to normal after February back surgery and a forearm flexor strain limited Paxton to five starts. He won 15 games for the Yankees in 2019, and so the pattern of tempting upside combined with vexing injury troubles continues for a pitcher who has never pitched more than 160 innings.

25. Brad Hand (30, LHP, Indians): The Indians declined his $10 million 2021 option, but there’s a decent chance Hand exceeds that, at least in total value, on the open market. He led the AL with 16 saves, had a 0.77 WHIP and did not give up a home run in 22 innings.

26. Mark Melancon (36, RHP, Braves): Melancon experienced a nice mini-renaissance these past two seasons, converting 23 of 25 save chances with the Giants and Braves, although his strikeout rate fell from 9.1 per nine innings last year to 5.6 this year. His value will depend on whether clubs will deem him a closer or a “guy who pitches the ninth inning.”

27. Trevor Rosenthal (30, RHP, Padres): Feeling lucky? Rosenthal’s 2020 was as dominant as his ’19 was disastrous. The man who walked a staggering 26 in 15 1/3 innings suddenly turned into Mr. Precision, posting a 0.85 WHIP, 38 strikeouts in 23 2/3 innings and the best walks per nine innings (3.0) since his rookie season of 2013. That dominance is hard to come by, but a multiyear commitment won’t be for the risk-averse.

28. Kiké Hernández (29, INF/OF, Dodgers): It’s not often a .240 lifetime hitter gets as much October airtime as political attack ads, but for the past six years, Hernandez kept finding himself in the middle of huge playoff moments for the Dodgers. This year, it was his game-tying homer in Game 7 of the NLCS. In another era, a club would overbid on him, try to make him an everyday player and everyone would go home miserable. In this era, a team will follow the Dodgers’ blueprint for usage and get themselves a highly useful utility player – he can play anywhere except catcher - who doesn’t shrink from any moment.

29. Drew Smyly (31, LHP, Giants): Is Smyly’s long climb back from missing the 2017-18 seasons complete? He was fantastic in a seven-game run for the Giants, striking out 42 in 26 1/3 innings and nearly pitching them into the playoffs on the season’s final day. Yet another intriguing risk-reward play.

30. Kevin Pillar (32, OF, Rockies): Still a premium defender, Pillar’s lot these days seems to be best player on a bad team. He did not have a job until mid-February and then was a rare bright spot on a horrid Red Sox team before he was flipped to Colorado. The modern off-season rhythm suggests Pillar will sign very late, once again, yet also please the team that does sign him.

31. César Hernández (30, 2B, Indians): Led the AL with 20 doubles and posted a .355 OBP, boosting his career mark to .352. Nothing dazzling about Hernandez, but he’s a capable defender who gets on base and can move the line along near the top of the order.

32. Garrett Richards (32, RHP, Padres): San Diego’s two-year investment in Richards’ Tommy John surgery recovery was a partial success: He capably covered 51 1/3 innings this year for a playoff team, with a 4.03 ERA over 14 appearances. Richards is five years removed from his last season making more than 16 starts, which means he may have to settle for another short-term deal this winter.

33. Rich Hill (41, LHP, Twins): A modern marvel, Hill returned from nine months on the shelf after a complicated elbow procedure and spun his curveball to the tune of a 1.16 WHIP and 3.03 ERA over eight starts. All indications are he wants to keep going.

34. Kolten Wong (30, 2B, Cardinals): It was mildly surprising the Cardinals declined Wong’s $12.5 million 2021 option, setting loose a 2019 Gold Glove winner who reached base at a .358 clip the past two seasons. But Wong offers little power and is a league-average offensive performer roughly every other year.

35. Taijuan Walker (28, RHP, Blue Jays): This shortened season was arguably the best of Walker’s inconsistent and injury-plagued career, producing a 1.16 WHIP in 11 starts and prompting Toronto to acquire him for its playoff push. Yet another scenario where a club must wager on Walker’s significant upside, even as he’ll be four years removed from his last season pitching more than 53 innings.

36. Blake Treinen (32, RHP, Dodgers): Treinen couldn’t quite come all the way back from a disastrous 2019 that followed an epic 2018 All-Star season, but did show a modicum of reliability in posting a 3.86 ERA. Can he ever regain the form that saw him punch out 11 batters per nine innings in ’18? Perhaps not, but he’ll still occupy a late-inning slot for somebody.

37. Jurickson Profar (28, INF/OF, Padres): Profar may not have the track record of Kike’ Hernandez or Tommy La Stella, but his relative youth may make him the best bet in the super utility category. He grooved with the Padres, posting his best OBP (.343) and adjusted OPS (113) of his career, and played five defensive positions.

38. José Quintana (32, LHP, Cubs): A kitchen accident limited Quintana to four appearances, so evaluators must ruminate on a 2019 that saw his ERA soar to 4.68, but his Fielding Independent Pitching drop to 3.80. Quintana will be five years removed from his lone All-Star season and won’t strike out 207 again as he did in 2017. He’ll still make a fine mid-rotation lefty for somebody.

39. Trevor May (31, RHP, Twins): It never hurts to have a late-ish innings guy who struck out 12.2 per nine innings the past three seasons. Command has been the issue for May; greater home run and walk avoidance would enhance his value.

40. J.A. Happ (38, LHP, Yankees): A sour finish to Happ’s season – a grim and series-turning appearance as a “bulk guy” in Game 2 of the ALDS – clouded a 2020 in which he posted a 1.05 WHIP over nine starts. Back-end, innings-eating lefties never die.

41. Jonathan Schoop (29, 2B, Tigers): After bottoming out with a .682 OPS in 2018, Schoop continued a gentle resurgence by posting a .799 OPS and again reestablished himself as better than a league-average performer. He’s a long way from the 32-homer All-Star of 2017, but still has some pop.

42. Yadier Molina (38, C, Cardinals): Will teams bid on the catcher who produced an 81 adjusted OPS and career-worst .303 OBP while making a pro-rated $20 million in 2020? Or will they bid on Yadi, possible Hall of Famer? That’s a question the Cardinals first must answer in a market where catchers are once again plentiful.

43. Jeremy Jeffress (33, RHP, Cubs): Quite a ride for Jeffress, from Brewers All-Star in 2018 to 5.02 ERA in 2019 to Cubs closer in 2020, when he posted a 0.94 WHIP despite a career-worst 1.42 strikeout-walk ratio.

44. Corey Kluber (34, RHP, Rangers): The two-time Cy Young winner pitched just one inning this year before tearing a muscle in the back of his shoulder. He’s been cleared to pitch, and likely will fall into the incentive-laden, short-term category.

45. Brandon Kintzler (36, RHP, Marlins): Miami declined his $4 million 2021 option even though Kintzler provided significant guts and glory to a COVID-stricken team that rallied for a surprise playoff berth. Kintzler converted 12 of 14 save chances, but 11 walks and just 14 strikeouts in 24 1/3 innings gives some pause that that rate is sustainable.

46. Tony Watson (35, LHP, Giants): Watson was undaunted in the first year of the three-batter minimum, holding right-handed hitters to a .573 OPS and lefty batters to .564 while producing an overall WHIP of 0.89.

47. Greg Holland (35, RHP, Royals): You can go home again. Over 28 games, Holland produced his best season since undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2015, striking out 31 in 28 1/3 innings, with just one home run given up.

48. Darren O’Day (38, RHP, Braves): Slingers live forever, evidenced by O’Day’s 0.80 WHIP and 1.10 ERA this season, followed by scoreless outings in four of his five playoff appearances. Tuck him between pure gas in the late innings and watch the magic unfurl.

49. Brett Anderson (33, LHP, Brewers): Has eased into the itinerant innings-eating stage of his career, with his ceiling somewhere around the 3.89 ERA over 176 innings he produced for Oakland in 2019.

50. Adam Eaton (32, OF, Nationals): An injury-riddled 2020 season belies a career .360 OBP and a 25-double, 15-homer, 15-steal 2019 campaign on a World Series-winning club.

51. Pedro Báez (33, RHP, Dodgers): Fun fact: Baez has pitched in more postseason games (31) than Clayton Kershaw has made postseason starts (30). Baez has never had an ERA worse than 3.35 and sports a career WHIP of 1.10. Immediately available for your seventh- and eighth-inning needs.

52. Yusmeiro Petit (36, RHP, Athletics): Better with age? Petit’s 1.66 ERA in 2020 was the best of his 13-year career, coming one season after appearing in a career-high 80 games.

53. Aaron Loup (33, LHP, Rays): Benefited greatly from the Rays’ acumen for pitcher usage, posting the best WHIP (0.84) of his career and best ERA (2.52) since 2013. Did not yield a homer to a left-handed batter, holding them to a .212 average. Righties batted .192 but with three homers in 52 at-bats.

54. Shane Greene (32, RHP, Braves): An All-Star closer in Detroit and a reliable late-inning guy in Atlanta, though declining strikeout rate (9.2 per nine innings in ’19, 6.8 in ’20) and strikeout-walk ratio (3.76, 2.33) may line him up for a lower-leverage slot in 2021.

55. Alex Wood (30, LHP, Dodgers): A respected veteran plagued by injuries the past two seasons, Wood ended 2020 on a high note with two crucial, scoreless relief outings in the World Series. While it’s questionable whether he’ll enjoy good health over a full season, Wood remains a valuable swingman in an era when clubs appreciate versatility on their staffs.

56. Robbie Grossman (31, OF, Athletics): Useful, switch-hitting corner outfielder who produced a career-best 130 adjusted OPS this season.

57. Tyler Clippard (36, RHP, Twins): Has not saved a game since 2018 but keeps putting up high-leverage zeroes while punching out a batter an inning the past two years with Cleveland and Minnesota.

58. Mike Fiers (35, RHP, Athletics): He can still consume innings, even if the quality with which he does so has diminished.

59. Carlos Santana (34, 1B/DH, Indians): It’s tough to lead the league in walks yet finish below league average as a hitter. That’s how 2020 went for Santana, who batted a career-worst .199, a season removed from an All-Star appearance. Could be reinvigorated with a DH expansion to the NL.

60. Robbie Ray (29, LHP, Blue Jays): Ray’s swing-and-miss skills will always lure clubs into hoping they can recreate 2015, when Ray made the All-Star team, won 15 games with a 2.89 ERA and struck out 218 in 162 innings. The strikeouts are still there – he averages 11 per nine innings for his career – but that’s about it: Ray walked a staggering 31 in 31 innings with Arizona before they dealt him to Toronto in August. SIGNED: One year, $8 million with Blue Jays, Nov. 7.

61. Tommy Hunter (34, RHP, Phillies): Showed he was recovered from a torn flexor tendon that ended his 2019 season, posting 25 strikeouts to six walks in 24 2/3 innings. Sufficiently seasoned and affable to fill the salty veteran reliever role on any squad.

62. Kirby Yates (34, RHP, Padres): His 41 saves led the NL in 2019, but bone chips in his right elbow required season-ending surgery after six largely ineffective outings. The recovery rate is very good after such a procedure, but Yates’ age and a market flooded with right-handed arms may make 2021 a year to reestablish his value.

63. Nick Markakis (37, OF, Braves): Sitting on 2,388 hits after a 2020 in which he opted out and back in, and then produced career lows in average (.254), OBP (.312) and OPS (.704). Whether he returns in 2021 remains an open question on both sides of the equation.

64. Mike Zunino (30, C, Rays): Batted .161 in his two years with Tampa Bay, but hit .300 with a pair of home runs in their ALCS conquest of Houston. A consummate glue guy who figures to intangible his way to a major league deal.

65 Joakim Soria (36, RHP, Athletics): After 732 big league appearances, Soria can still put up zeroes and for the past five years has struck out more than a batter per inning.

66. Asdrúbal Cabrera (35, INF, Nationals): Cabrera can still slug and play the corner infield spots competently. Replace Cabrera types with unproven players at your own risk.

67. Brad Miller (31, INF, Cardinals): Miller has graced five teams with his presence over the past four years, but all he did in St. Louis was tie for the team lead with seven home runs and rank second in OBP (.357). Useful until determined otherwise.

68. Cole Hamels (37, LHP, Braves): Shoulder problems dogged Hamels throughout 2020, from spring training to camp re-start and then limiting him to just one appearance before he shut it down.

69. Rick Porcello (32, RHP, Mets): The gap between Porcello’s ERA (a career-worst 5.64) and his FIP (a reasonable 3.33) was massive, perhaps portending a season less ghastly than it appears. He also made all 12 of his starts and completed six innings in half of them; someone will pay him to gobble those innings in 2021.

70. Howie Kendrick (37, 1B/DH, Nationals): The 2019 playoff hero was limited to 20 games by a hamstring injury and it’s possible the career .294 hitter may call it a career, although he indicated a preference to go out in a year less disrupted by pandemic and injury.

71. Anthony Bass (33, RHP, Blue Jays): It took Bass nearly a decade to accrue the service time necessary for free agency after his 2011 debut. Posted a WHIP of 1.06 over parts of the last three seasons with Seattle, the Cubs and Toronto.

72. Junior Guerra (36, RHP, Diamondbacks): Can serve capably as your fifth-, sixth- or seventh-inning guy.

73. Jason Kipnis (33, 2B, Cubs): A two-time All-Star who’s now league average by various definitions, Kipnis acquitted himself well in his Chicago homecoming, but will face a crowded market at his position.

74. Jake McGee (34, LHP, Dodgers): A nice bounceback after scuffling to a 4.78 ERA over four seasons in Colorado, McGee had a 0.84 WHIP and, oddly, held righties to a .135 average, lefties a .304 average.

75. Brad Boxberger (32, RHP, Marlins): Two years removed from a 32-save season, Boxberger was a reliable if not particularly dominant member of the Marlins’ bullpen over 18 innings.

76. Kurt Suzuki (37, C, Nationals): Provides league-average offense and second-tier pitch-framing, according to MLB Statcast. Hit two homers in 33 games after hitting 17 in 85 in 2019.

77. Justin Wilson (33, LHP, Mets): Posted a 1.35 WHIP in two years with the Mets. His ERA ticked up from 2.54 to 3.66 in 2020, the first year of the three-batter minimum.

78. Matt Joyce (36, OF, Marlins): His power comes and goes – last year it went, with two homers and a .331 slugging percentage – but Joyce remains a functional platoon dude, getting on base at a .370 rate against right-handers and .351 overall.

79. Sean Doolittle (34, LHP, Nationals): Two years removed from an All-Star season and one after leading the NL with 55 games finished, Doolittle hit a rough patch in 2020, suffering an oblique injury and working just 7 2/3 innings. The man with a knack for reinvention was aiming for another such act this winter.

80. Brandon Workman (32, RHP, Phillies): The truncated 2020 season did not agree with Workman, who went from a 10-1 record, 16 saves and a 1.88 ERA with Boston to a combined 5.95 ERA and 2.23 WHIP with the Red Sox and Phillies. A curious reclamation project, at least.

81. Wilson Ramos (33, C, Mets): He went from a 2.2-WAR player to replacement level in his two seasons in Queens, but Ramos should still be able to find a guaranteed gig sharing time behind the plate."

With losses for the Seattle Seahawks, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Arizona Cardinals, there are now six teams that are within one game of the lead (6-2) in the conference. Over in the AFC, the 8-1 Kansas City Chiefs, thanks to star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, look like they may be the top team in their conference by a comfortable margin. And Mahomes suddenly may have become the favorite to win his second MVP award.

TAKEAWAYS:32 things we learned from Week 9 of the 2020 NFL season

COWBOYS DE AFTER STEELERS' COMEBACK:‘Ain’t nobody elite’ in NFL

Here are the Week 9 winners and losers.

WINNERS

Parity atop the NFC

As the Buccaneers, Seahawks and Cardinals lost and the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints won, there's suddenly a logjam atop the NFC. That sets up what could be a thrilling race for the No. 1 seed in the second half of the season. All of those teams have either five or six victories and either two or three losses. The Los Angeles Rams, who were on their bye week, are also in the mix at 5-3.

Due to changes to the playoff format, only the top seed in each conference will enjoy a bye. Making this even more salivating for football fans, each of these teams has a quarterback who can dazzle and take over games when called upon. At different points so far this season, each squad looked like it might be the best in the conference. And with the landscape so wide open, there should be an even higher sense of urgency as the season wears on.

QB futures in Miami and Arizona

Though the Miami Dolphins beat the Cardinals in a thrilling 34-31 game, both teams have to be feeling optimistic about what they saw out of their young quarterbacks. Dolphins rookie Tua Tagovailoa's second career start answered many of the questions that popped up in his first. He showcased mobility, erasing any concerns from his significant hip injury sustained while at Alabama. He demonstrated he can make throws when flushed out of the pocket. Most importantly, he showed he can put the game in his hands and make plays when the Dolphins needed him to do so. Tagovailoa finished 20-of-28 for 248 yards with two scores.

Meanwhile, Murray continued to develop into one of the most dangerous dual-threat quarterbacks in the entire NFL. He became the first player in league history to throw for 275 or more yards with three passing touchdowns while adding 100 or more rushing yards with at least one rushing score. In fact, it was conservative play-calling late in the game that led to a missed Zane Gonzalez 49-yard field goal and the Cardinals' loss.

Patrick Mahomes

While everyone was talking about Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers early in the MVP race, Chiefs passer Patrick Mahomes kept plugging along in a 33-31 victory against the Carolina Panthers.

Mahomes completed 30 of 45 attempts for 372 yards and four touchdowns. He has now thrown nine touchdowns in his last two games and has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 25:1. He also became the fastest in NFL history to reach 100 passing touchdowns, doing so in 40 career games, four fewer than Miami Dolphin legend and previous record holder Dan Marino. Mahomes is just in his third year as Kansas City's starter, has the defending Super Bowl champions sitting at 8-1 and may be on pace to add his second MVP award after this season.

LOSERS

Seahawks' fatal flaw

Seattle had won eight consecutive games in the early slate of Sunday games but fell Sunday in a 44-34 loss to the Buffalo Bills. And for the Seahawks, who had looked like one of the top contenders in the NFL, it has become clear that their fatal flaw could be a defense that simply yields far too many yards and big plays. The 44 points was the most a Pete Carroll-led Seattle team has ever allowed. ""So out of character across the board,"" Carroll said after the game. ""I don't even recognize us.""

Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen went off in an ultra-efficient performance, completing 31 of 38 passes for 415 yards and four total touchdowns. The Seahawks are now giving up an average of 30.4 points a game, ranking them in the bottom quarter of the NFL. Though they generated seven sacks against Buffalo, their pass rush had been inconsistent. No other secondary in the NFL has allowed more passing yards (2,897). And while Wilson has been very impressive, Seattle's leaky defense just puts too much pressure on its to outscore opponents. While the Seahawks (6-2) have been able to manage so far this season, as competition tightens and as they face tougher opponents if they reach the postseason, that pace may be unsustainable.

Buccaneers

Tampa Bay looked utterly lifeless in a 38-3 loss against the NFC South-rival Saints. New Orleans swept the Buccaneers, which could prove to be critical in playoff seeding. It was also the most lopsided loss of quarterback Tom Brady's storied career.

New Orleans' offensive line completely dominated Tampa Bay's typically disruptive pass rush, allowing Saints quarterback Drew Brees ample time to find open targets. Most concerning, Brady and the Bucs offense looked completely disjointed, going three-and-out in their first four possessions, only to be followed in the fifth by an interception. Brady finished the game with 209 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions and had some baffling decisions. Tampa Bay rushed the ball just four times. The Buccaneers will want to erase this one from their memory, but injuries at receiver are just one of the team's concerns.

Los Angeles Chargers' luck

You really have to feel for Chargers fans. On a day when rookie quarterback Justin Herbert broke Cam Newton's record for most passing yards through a rookie's first seven starts, the Chargers again fell in heartbreaking fashion to the Las Vegas Raiders. On the final play of the game, the Chargers appeared to have a game-winning touchdown, but a replay reversal showed that tight end Donald Parham bobbled what would have been a touchdown grab as he fell to the turf. They lost, 31-26.

Los Angeles is now 2-6, and not only have their losses occurred almost universally in devastating ways, the defeats have all come by a one-score deficit with an average margin of four points. When looking at reasons for the trend, the chief culprit has to be a defense that has been a letdown during crucial stretches. At some point, the Chargers' luck seems bound for a correction, but it's looking increasingly like that could be too late if it does happen at all.

Denver Broncos' slow starts

There's plenty of blame to go around for the team's 34-27 loss against the Atlanta Falcons, but a slow start – again – was too much to overcome. The first time Denver crossed into the red zone on offense came with 4:10 left to play in the game. The defense started the game letting Atlanta convert six of eight third-down attempts.

While the Broncos did outscore the Falcons 21-7 in the fourth quarter, it was their 17-point deficit headed into halftime that sunk their hopes of winning. By the time Lock and the Denver offense woke up, it was too late. Denver (3-5) has been plagued by significant injuries to its pass rush and secondary, but offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur's decision to try to establish the run early in the game helped lead to that ineffective start. Lock ended up as Denver's leading rusher. Slow starts are not the sign of a team that often wins on the road.

The Chicago Bears as a contender

Chicago has enjoyed a light schedule on the way to a 5-4 mark through the first half of the season, but this looks like a team that is worse than its record indicates. Coach Matt Nagy's offense, again, was woeful and underwhelmed in a 24-17 loss to the Tennessee Titans.

Midway through the third quarter, the Bears had failed to convert any of their nine third down tries. Their leading rusher was Barkevious Mingo, a linebacker, who had one carry for 11 yards. They had just four offensive first downs. By the end of the game, those numbers weren't much better. Chicago went 2-of-15 (13%) on third down; running back David Montgomery (14 carries for 30 yards) was their rushing leader, and the Bears finished with 22 first downs, though most were secured in garbage time. The offensive line cedes too much pressure and cannot open rushing lanes. To characterize production out of the tight end position as spotty would be quite generous. And situational coaching and play-calling decisions often make things harder than they need to be. The Bears have lost three in a row, and a playoff run looks like a pipe dream."

That win gives the Irish a stronger case for No. 2 than Ohio State, which stays in third after breezing past Rutgers. While OSU has been undeniably impressive, the Irish have played four more games overall than the Buckeyes and three more against Power Five competition.

And no OSU win can come close to Notre Dame's win against Clemson, which hadn't lost in the regular season since 2017. Since the narrow loss came on the road and with several key players unavailable, the Tigers only fall to No. 4.

The 1-127 has a harder time with the Florida and Texas A&M conundrum. The Gators just beat Georgia. The Aggies were off. Both have one loss, with Florida's coming by a field goal to A&M. While beating the Bulldogs would normally lead to a big jump in the rankings, Florida only moves up two spots to No. 7 and remains just behind No. 6 A&M.

This week's 1-127 also found two preseason Big Ten contenders continuing to plummet down the rankings. Penn State is down 24 to No. 59 after falling to 0-3. And Michigan is down another 16 spots to No. 66 after losing to Indiana, which is up to No. 12."

USA TODAY Network

LSU wide receiver Koy Moore detailed an allegation of harassment by Baton Rouge Police this weekend on social media Sunday.

In a statement on Twitter, Moore said he was ""violated"" by officers who were searching him for a weapon.

""Last night I was approached by a policeman they pulled guns on me assuming I had a gun and drugs. (screaming 'where's your gun?'),"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I was violated numerous times even as going as far as trying to unzip my pants in search of a weapon that I repeatedly told them I did not have.

""As I tried to go live for video documentation of the harassment they snatched my phone I couldn't lost my life and I know for a fact nothing wouldn't have happened to the guys who did it. as some celebrate the election of a new president understand the real problem has not changed if I didn't tell those incompetent officers that I was an LSU football player there's no telling if I wouldn't been here to tell the story!""

A statement by Baton Rouge Police released Monday afternoon said ""the three officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is under investigation.""

Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul initiated an Internal Affairs investigation into Moore's complaint.

""We appreciate Mr. Moore bringing this incident to our attention,"" Paul said in the statement. ""As in every case, we will be collecting all available evidence and conducting interviews. Accountability and transparency are critical in building trust with the community. I pledge a thorough investigation into this complaint.""

LSU coach Ed Orgeron issued a statement Sunday, saying he was aware of the allegations.

""While I cannot comment on the investigation, what I can say is that we must work collectively to embrace our differences. We have to listen, learn and come together to combat social injustice and racism if we are to create a safer and more equitable society for all people.""

Earlier Monday, Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome released a statement on Twitter saying she has been in contact with the police:

""My office has been made aware of a situation concerning BRPD and an LSU student. Upon notification, I have been in contact with Chief Paul; he has assured me his department is thoroughly investigating this matter and he has been in touch with the student.

""We take these allegations seriously and will await the findings of the investigation. We will get to the bottom of this situation and keep the lines of communication open with the community.""

Moore, a freshman, has eight catches for 70 yards this season.

Let's begin with Notre Dame. Beating the Tigers puts the Irish at the front of the line in the ACC and creates enough wiggle room to lose once and still get into the playoff — especially if that loss comes to Clemson.

There will very likely be a rematch between the two teams in the ACC championship game. By winning the second matchup, Clemson would enter the postseason as a one-loss Power Five champion with enough of a recent track record to sail into the semifinals.

But the Irish would also be in possession of a strong case for the top four under this condition: Notre Dame wins out the rest of the way and loses only to the Tigers.

Another pathway to the playoff with one loss — let's say it comes at North Carolina on Nov. 27 — would require beating Clemson twice in one season. If obviously possible, the rematch would see the Tigers closer to full strength, with Trevor Lawrence back at quarterback and James Skalski and Tyler Davis back on defense.

NEW LEADER:Alabama takes over at No. 1 in Amway Coaches Poll

MISERY INDEX:Penn State suddenly with little to play for in pandemic year

HIGHS AND LOWS:College football winners and losers from Week 10

For the first time in the history of the postseason format, the ACC may occupy the spotlight in determining the makeup of the playoff.

Here’s how the top four would look today, followed by the four teams just on the outside:

1. Alabama: No longer the winner-take-all matchup some might've expected in the preseason, Alabama's game against LSU is instead a pairing of the nation's No. 2 offense against the nation's No. 116 defense.

2. Notre Dame: Prior to Saturday night, Notre Dame's last win against a No. 1 opponent came against Florida State in 1993. The Irish followed that with a shocking 41-39 loss to Boston College. Up next for the Irish: Boston College.

3. Ohio State: In 20 games with Ryan Day as the permanent head coach, the Buckeyes have scored 72 touchdowns on 93 trips to the red zone, a 77.4% touchdown rate.

4. Clemson: When was the last time Clemson allowed 500 yards of offense to an ACC opponent? Louisville in 2016. The last time Clemson allowed at least 200 yards rushing and 300 yards passing? Against Georgia to open the 2013 season.

Lurking

5. Texas A&M: The Aggies' 7.36 yards per play in Saturday's 48-3 win against South Carolina was the program's highest per-play average against an SEC opponent under Jimbo Fisher.

6. Florida: Kyle Trask played his way into Heisman Trophy contention after throwing four touchdowns in the big win against Georgia, making him the first quarterback in SEC history to toss at least four scores in five consecutive games.

7. Cincinnati: The Bearcats limited Houston to 282 yards of offense and 3.3 yards per carry in the latest dominant performance from one of the nation's best defenses.

8. Indiana: A combined 2-61 since 1968 against Penn State and Michigan, the Hoosiers are 2-0 against those two bluebloods in 2020 and on the verge of the program's most successful finish since 1967.

At this point, there's no team worthy of moving ahead of Clemson and into the top four. Along with the fact that it took two overtimes, a factor to consider when weighing how the Tigers will be viewed for the playoff is how the selection committee will weigh the missing pieces during Saturday's loss.

Will the committee give Clemson credit for nearly winning without Lawrence under center? Maybe, though the fact that D.J. Uiagalelei set a single-game record for most passing yards against Notre Dame does damage to that case.

The losses on defense were far more important. Down pieces up front, multiple linebackers and hurting for proven depth, Clemson's typically outstanding unit was eventually worn down by Ian Book and the Notre Dame offense.

Brigham Young will also test the committee. Beating Boise State handily helps the Cougars' case, but the committee won't be too impressed by the team's overall strength of schedule. In the end, however, BYU's high quality of play could be too much to ignore."
336,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2020/11/09/sterling-brown-police-lawsuit-settlement-offered-milwaukee-bucks/6220307002/,"In Bucks' Sterling Brown lawsuit, city attorney for Milwaukee recommends $750,000 payment","MILWAUKEE – The city attorney has recommended a $750,000 payment and proposed changes to the Milwaukee Police Department's policies to settle a lawsuit brought by Milwaukee Bucks' player Sterling Brown.

The settlement proposal also includes an admission that Brown's constitutional rights were violated when officers took him to the ground, tasered him and arrested him during an encounter in January 2018 that began with a parking violation.

If approved by Milwaukee elected officials, the settlement likely would become the first time the city admitted wrongdoing in a police misconduct case.

Since 2015, police misconduct has cost Milwaukee taxpayers at least $31.6 million in legal settlements, forcing the city to borrow money to make the payouts amid an ever-tightening budget.

That amount includes the recent $4 million settlement the city reached with the estate of Sylville Smith, whose death from a police shooting in 2016 set off days of unrest.

The city is self-insured, meaning taxpayers are on the hook for the payments.

In Brown's case, the proposed monetary amount includes attorneys' fees and costs, and is larger than the $400,000 originally signed off on by Milwaukee Common Council in September 2019.

In a letter dated Nov. 4, City Attorney Tearman Spencer recommended the new settlement proposal to the Common Council's Committee on Judiciary and Legislation ""because of the unpredictability of a trial, and the city's risk for exposure to compensatory and punitive damages, as well as additional attorney fees and costs.""

At the time of the original settlement offer last year, Brown's attorney, Mark Thomsen, said: ""Any settlement that doesn't include an admission that they violated Mr. Brown's civil rights will go nowhere. We can't heal in this city without that.”

Thomsen declined an interview Monday, citing the pending proceedings before city officials. He did sign the settlement agreement after getting authorization from Brown, according to federal court records.

It was not immediately clear Monday morning if the new settlement offer will move forward at City Hall and what exact Police Department policy changes are being sought. The settlement must be approved by the committee and the full Common Council before going to Mayor Tom Barrett.

In an interview, Spencer confirmed his office had reached a tentative agreement in the case. He said details about the terms would come once city officials signed off on it.

The Milwaukee Police Department declined to comment on the settlement proposal because the litigation remains pending.

Fighting for positive change

In January 2018, a group of officers took Brown to the ground, tased and arrested him after a parking violation at a Walgreens, prompting an internal investigation that ended with several officers suspended and others retrained.

Brown was not charged. In police body camera footage, Brown can be seen remaining calm and polite as the officers progressively become more confrontational.

Several months after the incident, then-Assistant Police Chief Michael Brunson, who currently is the acting chief, showed Brown a four-minute clip of video from his arrest.

“I get mad every time I watch it,"" Brown told the Journal Sentinel in May 2018. “I was defenseless.”

At the time, Brunson apologized, but Brown said: “It doesn’t justify what happened.""

Brown has consistently said he wanted to use the attention — something he did not ask for — to fight for positive change. The son of a police officer, Brown grew up in Maywood, Ill., not far across the state line from Wisconsin.

After the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Brown helped lead protests against racism and police brutality this summer.

In June, he looked at a 7,500-person crowd outside Fiserv Forum in June and told the marchers they were ""making something great happen, something positive happen, something that’s heard around the world.""

“As we march today, let’s be loud, let’s be known,"" he said.

The Bucks released a statement later Monday, saying the organization was pleased Brown's lawsuit ""has been mutually resolved and that there’s been an important commitment by the City of Milwaukee and its Police Department to make changes.""

""No one should ever have to go through the horrifying abuse and injustice that Sterling experienced,"" the statement read.

Alison Dirr of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.

They’re a means for change.

It’s been nearly 50 years since Title IX was passed in the United States, opening gymnasiums and playing fields to girls and women. It is no coincidence that, since then, the number of women with college degrees has increased, as have women’s earnings. There are more female executives.

""Changing the Game"" is a new podcast from USA TODAY Sports, sponsored by Artistry Studio exclusively from Amway, that explores how sports has fueled the gains women have made – and why we need to keep pushing for equality and acceptance.

Guests include Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez, basketball coach Muffet McGraw, WNBA player Nneka Ogwumike, NBA broadcaster Doris Burke, BMX rider Chelsea Wolfe, former NFL coach Jen Welter, professional golfer Cheyenne Woods, and Olympic swimmer Simone Manuel.

Participating in sports teaches women leadership skills, and bolsters their self-esteem and self-worth. It opens their minds to possibilities they might otherwise never imagine.

It also shapes how society views women.

If you saw McGraw on the sidelines when she was the coach at Notre Dame, you know a woman is every bit as capable of being a leader or running a company as a man.

Sports also provides women with a platform to raise their voices and set an example. When Simone Manuel explains how limiting stereotypes can be, you’ll see the power of representation.

""Changing the Game"" is a celebration of how far women have come because of sports. But it’s also a call to action to do better, not only for the next generation of female athletes, but for women everywhere.

It’s clear that this will go down as an immensely memorable year due in part to the challenges that COVID-19 has presented. However, the on-field action has been quite compelling.

The defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs might be even better this year. The Super Bowl runner-up San Francisco 49ers, meanwhile, have been ravaged by injury.

The NFC West looks like the best division in football, with three playoff-caliber squads, while the NFC East is historically bad.

Two long-time head coaches (Bill O’Brien and Dan Quinn) have been fired. Two second-year coaches (Brian Flores and Kliff Kingsbury) have their teams in contention.

Big-name stars like Nick Bosa, Odell Beckham Jr., Saquon Barkley and Dak Prescott all suffered season-ending injuries.

Here’s a look at some of the biggest surprises and biggest disappointments of the first half of the season.

Surprise: Buffalo’s leap – The Buffalo Bills seemed prime for improvement in 2020, but their 7-2 start has impressed. No longer is this a mediocre offense carried by a strong defense. Buffalo ranks among one of the most well-rounded squads thus far.

Quarterback Josh Allen, who has made quite a jump in Year 3, ranks third in passing yards (2,587) while improving his completion rate from 58.8% in 2019 to 67.1% this season. Entering the year, Allen had yet to notch a 300-yard passing day. This year, he has five, including two 400-yard outings. Already, he has thrown for 19 touchdowns a year after notching 20. His passer rating also has jumped from 85.3 to 107.2.

The Bills’ two losses have come against the Super Bowl champion Chiefs and AFC runner-up Tennessee Titans. However, Buffalo owns a 4-0 record in the AFC East and boasts statement wins against the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks.

Disappointment: New England’s collapse – We knew life without Tom Brady would be interesting, but Bill Belichick's teams are always well-coached, and Cam Newton’s arrival sparked hope that the New England Patriots would exceed expectations. But Newton has struggled mightily, recording only two touchdown passes and seven interceptions, and New England enters Monday with a 2-5 record after experiencing its first four-game losing streak since 2002.

Now, more than ever, Brady’s departure looks like a genius move. The cupboard in New England may have been even more bare than anyone realized. The Patriots’ offensive playmakers are missing in action, and young defensive players counted on to fill voids left by free agent departures and COVID-19 opt-outs have underperformed. Belichick's Pats appear headed for their first losing record since 2000, his first season with the squad.

Surprise: Russell Wilson’s TD pace – Quite possibly one of the game’s most underrated stars, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson entered this season having never received an MVP vote. He appears determined to change that this season. Gone is the conservative offensive approach that the Seahawks have traditionally utilized. They’re letting Russ cook, and he is responding authoritatively, delivering a league-high 28 touchdown passes, putting him within reach of Peyton Manning's single-season record (55), while ranking second in passer rating at 117.1. Meanwhile, Seattle's offense leads the NFL in points per game while the team is tied the best record (6-2) in the conference.

Disappointment: Seattle’s defense – The Seahawks very well could be undefeated if they could play a lick of defense. Instead, they give up more yards (455.8 per game) than any team in the league while allowing 30.4 points per game. They can’t stop the run, can’t stop the pass and can’t get after the quarterback. This puts way too much pressure on Wilson and the offense to be perfect. The absence of Jamal Adams hurt, but the All-Pro safety made his return Sunday. The Seahawks are hoping that a healthy Adams and last week’s trade for Carlos Dunlap provides a spark in the second half of the season. But will that be enough?

Surprise: Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert – They haven't been perfect, but the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow (the No. 1 overall pick) and the Los Angeles Chargers' Justin Herbert (the No. 6 pick) have shown they can sling it with the best of them. Both rank among the top 10 in passing yards per game. Herbert is averaging 306.6 yards while completing 67.3% of his passes with 17 touchdowns and five interceptions. Burrow is averaging 284 yards and completing 67% of his passes with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. Both have displayed remarkable poise and feel for the game. Their teams still have to surround these young passers with more talent, but the future is indeed bright in Cincinnati and L.A.

A third rookie quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa (the No. 5 pick), just took the reins for his team last week, but is 2-0 now for the 5-3 Miami Dolphins. He very well could join Burrow and Herbert on the list of impressive rookie passers by season’s end.

Disappointment: Jones' and Haskins' struggles – The New York Giants and Washington Football Team each needed their second-year quarterbacks to take big steps forward this season, but Daniel Jones and Dwayne Haskins haven’t at all delivered in a way that their coaches have hoped. Jones, the No. 6 overall pick of the 2019 draft, has only eight touchdown passes to go with nine interceptions for the 2-7 Giants. And Haskins, taken nine picks later, was benched after four games for 2-6 Washington. Jones can thank his lucky stars for Washington. He owns a 4-0 record against the NFC East rival and a 1-17 record against the rest of the NFL. Haskins has been waiting for his second chance since Week 4, but with Kyle Allen now injured, he just might get another shot.

MORE:32 things we learned from Week 9 of the 2020 NFL season

Surprise: Pittsburgh’s rebound – The Pittsburgh Steelers did an admirable job going 8-8 with Ben Roethlisberger lost to injury the bulk of last season, and his healthy return was expected to make the group more competitive. But few in or outside of the organization would have predicted that Pittsburgh would own an 8-0 record halfway through the season. Yet here they are. Powered by an aggressive, young defense, talented emerging offensive weapons, a wily quarterback and an unflinching, tone-setting head coach, the Steelers are the only unbeaten team in the league. They haven’t been perfect. Their games mostly are nail-biters. But they do possess a special resilience, and that has made all the difference.

Disappointment: Dallas’ dismal start – Mike McCarthy was supposed to take the perpetually underperforming Dallas Cowboys and make them contenders. But so far, the former Super Bowl-winning head coach has appeared to be in over his head. Even before Prescott’s season-ending injury, Dallas failed to live up to expectations with its 2-3 start. Since then, things have gone from bad to worse. The Cowboys have lost four straight. They can’t stop anyone. They can’t move the ball or score consistently, and now they’re on their fourth quarterback. Dallas (2-7) is fortunate it plays in the putrid NFC East, but the team's chance of a turnaround appears shot.

1. The U.S. presidential election is over – presumably – but there's still half a season before ballots are due for the NFL's 2020 MVP ... and Seahawks QB Russell Wilson may have opened up the race after turning the ball over four times in Sunday's loss at Buffalo, where he was thoroughly outplayed by Bills QB Josh Allen. Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, Packers QB Aaron Rodgers, Cardinals QB Kyler Murray, Saints RB Alvin Kamara and perhaps even Allen, Buccaneers QB Tom Brady, Titans RB Derrick Henry and Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger are all poised to start stealing electoral votes from Wilson.

2. Think the NFL quarterbacking paradigm isn't changing? Wilson's brilliance aside, Murray and Miami's Tua Tagovailoa engaged in Sunday's best contest – a 34-31 thriller in the desert won by the Dolphins. Murray bested Wilson and the Seahawks 37-34 in overtime two weeks ago, arguably the game of the year to this point. Sure seems like vertically challenged, mobile passers are becoming de rigueur in a league long dominated by 6-4 guys who could sling it while never leaving the pocket.

3. Hopefully CBS learned a lesson here. It could have sent its broadcast A-Team of Jim Nantz and Tony Romo to cover Murray and Tua. Instead, they were watching ... yes, the Cowboys. Why? Because who doesn't want more of Dallas – and Garrett Gilbert. Sigh.

4. The Bills' 44-34 defeat of Seattle serves as the most impressive showing of the season for the AFC East leaders – Allen playing his best game in a month, and the defense collecting four turnovers and five sacks while turning Seattle away on nine of 12 of third downs.

4a. However Buffalo's highly suspect run game resurfaced Sunday, averaging just 1.8 yards on 19 attempts ... and against the defense that allows more yards than any other (though Seattle is generally better against the run). Still, it continues to loom as a major concern for a Bills team that struggles to close out opponents but must improve on that front it it hopes to be more than one and done in the playoffs yet again.

5. Mahomes now has 25 TD passes against one interception, which would be the best ratio in history, besting Brady's 28-to-2 standard from four years ago.

5a. Mahomes also threw his 100th career TD pass Sunday in his 40th NFL game, a new league record. Hall of Famer Dan Marino needed 44 games to hit triple digits.

6. Speaking of keepin' it 100, Texans DE J.J. Watt notched his 100th career sack in his 120th career game – making him the fourth-fastest player ever to reach the century mark in that department. (Only Reggie White, DeMarcus Ware, and Bruce Smith needed fewer games – pretty select company there.)

7. The AFC playoff race could be wild. The Raiders and Dolphins moved into wild-card spots with victories Sunday, while the Colts and idle Browns were bounced out.

8. The Steelers are 8-0 for the first time in franchise history – even though they struggled to beat a vastly outgunned group of Cowboys – and have a good chance to significantly extend their unbeaten start.

9. Entering Week 9, the Dolphins were allowing the fewest points per game (18.6) in the league – yet the Cardinals became the third team to hang 31 on Miami.

10. What can you do while wearing the cleat version of the Air Jordan X? Just ask Carolina's Teddy Bridgewater and Las Vegas' Derek Carr ...

11. Pittsburgh has a sack in 65 consecutive games, closing in on Tampa Bay's league record (69).

12. Murray and Hall of Famer Charley Trippi are the only Cardinals passers in the past 70 years to rush for at least 100 yards in a game.

12a. Murray's eighth rushing TD is a single-season record among Arizona quarterbacks, and he is the first at his position with that many scores on the ground through eight games.

13. Dolphins K Jason Sanders has converted all 38 of his kicks (17 field goals, 21 extra points), including a game-winning 50-yard FG to beat Arizona.

14. I did a radio show in Washington this week with my buddies Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier, and they asked me to preview the Giants-Washington game. After realizing they were serious, it occurred to me they're also right – every NFC East matchup still on the calendar, no matter how bad it appears on paper, could have significant playoff ramifications.

14a. The Giants prevailed 23-20, improving to 2-7 and finishing off a season sweep of Washington. Don't count New York out of this division, ludicrous a notion as that might seem, now that the scrappy Giants have been in six consecutive games decided by one score (2-4 in those contests).

15. The victory was especially meaningful for Giants DB Logan Ryan, who clinched the win with an interception just days after he nearly lost his wife to an unexpected ectopic pregnancy. ""No one really knows what I went through all week emotionally,"" he said, ""but the team supported me great and I definitely wanted to do something for my wife and kids in that situation.""

15a. Ryan credited Giants trainer Justin Maher for diagnosing his wife's complications last week, believing it helped save her life.

16. What is it about NFC East quarterbacks and terrible lower-leg injuries? Washington's Kyle Allen was the latest to suffer one Sunday, subsequently replaced by Alex Smith – and we all know about his challenging comeback. Cowboys QB Dak Prescott was felled by a similarly gruesome mishap earlier this season.

17. You really have to feel for the Chargers, who had near-miss TDs on the final two plays of a 31-26 loss to the Raiders – the second play originally ruled a scoring catch to TE Donald Parham before being (correctly) overturned.

17a. All six of the Bolts' losses in 2020 have been within one score, the average margin of defeat four points. They are a league-worst 3-15 in one-score games since the start of last season.

18. But at least the Chargers looked dope. I know everyone goes nuts for their powder blue, but I'll always love them in navy.

19. Baltimore posted at least 20 points for the 31st consecutive regular-season game, establishing a new NFL record.

20. Prior to Sunday's 24-10 triumph, the Ravens were 0-6 at Indianapolis – home of Baltimore's previous NFL franchise, the Colts.

21. Colts QB Philip Rivers isn't a very good last line of defense ...

22. Look at the Falcons ... (barely) closing out a game they led by 21 points.

23. Acquired before the trade deadline from the Chargers, CB Desmond King II returned a fumble for a touchdown in his Titans debut, a victory over the Bears that restored sole ownership of the AFC South lead to Tennessee.

23a. DE Carlos Dunlap had a sack in his Seahawks debut.

23b. DE Everson Griffen had three tackles in his Lions debut.

24. Nice keepaway strategy by the Panthers in Kansas City. Carolina ran 18 more plays than the Chiefs, holding the ball for more than 38 minutes. Didn't quite work in a narrow 33-31 loss to the defending champs, but coach Matt Rhule continues to impress in his first year running an NFL squad.

24a. Panthers RB Christian McCaffrey scored two more TDs in his first action since Week 2, when he suffered a high ankle sprain. Yet Carolina is 0-3 when he plays, 3-3 when he doesn't.

25. Panthers K Joey Slye nearly hit a 65-yard field goal in New Orleans two weeks ago. His 67-yard attempt to beat the Chiefs wasn't as close.

25a. The NFL record length for a field goal is 64 yards.

26. Prior to Sunday's beatdown from the Saints, Brady had never been swept by a divisional opponent in his career.

26a. Prior to Sunday's beatdown from the Saints, Brady had never suffered a 35-point defeat.

26b. Prior to Sunday's beatdown from the Saints, Brady was the NFL's all-time leader in TD passes with 561 ... but he now trails New Orleans' Drew Brees, who's suddenly up to 564.

26c. If not for Ronald Jones' 7-yard scamper, the Buccaneers would have had 1 yard rushing.

27. Vikings RB Dalvin Cook deserves the love he's getting after surpassing 200 yards from scrimmage in successive games as Minnesota has strung together its first winning streak of 2020.

27a. But, man, is Vikes QB Kirk Cousins deadly when operating in a balanced offense. He has a 146.7 passer rating while basically serving as a sidekick to Cook the past two weeks.

28. WR Antonio Brown caught three passes for 31 yards while debuting for the Buccaneers, his first NFL action in more than a year.

29. Simply amazing how Packers WR Davante Adams – he has 10+ catches and 150+ yards in three of six appearances this season – continues to run it up on opponents who probably know Rodgers doesn't have a dynamic second option in the passing game. Adams is projected to get one of my wideout All-pro votes, though polls remain open for a while.

30. And yet, Houston WR Will Fuller V caught a TD pass for the sixth consecutive game Sunday. The pending free agent sure would have looked sweet in green and gold ...

31. Does anyone in the NFL have a better name than 49ers WR River Cracraft? Mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday ...

32. A loyal reader from Pac-12 country suggested Sunday that (Jake) ""Luton Lunacy"" will replace (Gardner) ""Minshew Mania"" in Jacksonville. Luton, a rookie drafted out of Oregon State this spring, made a strong debut (304 pass yards, TD, rush TD) in a defeat to the Texans as Washington State product Minshew sat with a lingering thumb injury.

“I can confirm we were aware,’’ White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert said. “Because this is an active case, we cannot comment further at this time.’’

A high-ranking White Sox official told USA TODAY Sports that La Russa is in no danger of losing his job, or receiving any discipline by the club.

It’s the second known drunken driving arrest for La Russa, 76, who plead guilty in 2007 to a misdemeanor DUI in Jupiter, Fla., while managing the St. Louis Cardinals.

La Russa was pulled over on Feb. 24 when his SUV hit a curb near the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He was taken into custody after failing a field sobriety test, but refused to submit to a breath, blood or urine test, according to an affidavit filed with the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

The case was filed on Oct. 28, one day before La Russa was announced as manager of the White Sox.

La Russa, who lives in Phoenix part-time and in Danville, Calif., was cited for driving under the influence and registering a blood-alcohol content of .08 or more. If convicted, La Russa could face up to 10 days in jail.

In March of 2007 during spring training, La Russa was arrested on a drunken driving charge after police said they found him asleep inside his vehicle at a stop light in Jupiter, Florida.

""(The) situation is the opposite of feeling good,"" La Russa said at the time. ""It was an embarrassment, so I apologize to anyone who is close to me, members of the Cardinals organization, our fans. I regret it, take responsibility and I'm not sure there is anything else I can say."""

The free agency period will begin two days after the NBA draft.

Beyond agreeing to those proposed dates on Monday night, the NBA and National Basketball Players Association agreed that salary reductions will be spread across this upcoming season and potentially the following two years to account for the $1.5 billion the league lost in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The maximum salary reduction in any season will be at 20%. The $1.5 billion reduction in revenue stems from losses in gate revenue ($800 million), sponsorships ($400 million) and the fallout with China after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protestors during the preseason ($200 million).

Because of the depleted revenue, the NBA finalized the 2020-21 season’s salary cap at $109.140 million and the luxury tax threshold at $132.627 million. The NBA added in a statement that both the salary cap and tax level will increase in subsequent seasons by at least 3% and at most 10% from the previous seasons. It added that teams’ tax payments will be reduced in proportion to any decrease in basketball-related income (BRI).

Before the NBA suspended the season in March because of COVID-19, USA TODAY Sports reported that the cap projection would be at $115 million and the luxury tax threshold would be at $139 million.

343,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/big12/2020/11/09/texas-tech-football-player-arrested-police-provide-details/6228571002/,Texas Tech 'gathering facts' after police report provides details of football player's arrest,"A Texas Tech football player was arrested Sunday morning after reportedly ignoring commands of police officers responding to reports that he and another person were threatening to shoot employees of a restaurant in South Lubbock, according to a Lubbock police report.

Brandon Bouyer-Randle was booked into the Lubbock County Detention Center Sunday morning on a state-jail felony count of evading police in a watercraft or motor vehicle.

The charge, as initially presented in online jail records was initially input as ""evading in a watercraft"" by mistake.

He was released around 1:50 a.m. Monday. Court records show his case was closed but that he was released pending the possible future filing of charges.

According to a police report, an officer responded to the I-Hop in the 3900 block of South Loop 289 after receiving reports about two people in a black Cadillac circling the restaurant's parking lot and threatening to shoot two restaurant employees. A second police report states that a black Chrysler 300, was also involved, the report states.

A responding officer immediately spotted a black Cadillac in the Jason's Deli and IHOP parking lot traveling northbound.

The officer pulled into the parking lot and initiated a stop on the Cadillac, which immediately pulled into a parking spot.

According to the report, the officer drew his service weapon when he approached the vehicle because the call indicated the involvement of a firearm.

The officer said he took cover behind another vehicle as he repeatedly ordered the driver of the Cadillac, later identified as Bouyer-Randle, to roll down his windows. He said he saw Bouyer-Randle look at him, which gave him the impression that he knew a police officer was detaining him.

However, the officer said Bouyer-Randle ignored his commands and began to back out of the parking spot. The officer returned to his patrol vehicle and stopped the Cadillac by pushing it with the front push bar of his vehicle.

Bouyer-Randle was removed from the Cadillac and handcuffed, the report states. The front quarter panel of the Cadillac was damaged by the officer's actions.

""Due to the totality of the circumstances, it was apparent that (Bouyer-Randle) intentionally used his motor vehicle to flee from a person (he) knew was a peace officer attempting to lawfully detain him,"" the officer wrote in his report. ""(Bouyer-Randle) was arrested for evading in a motor vehicle.""

The second police report stated that one of the restaurant employees identified Bouyer-Randle as one of the people making the threats. He said he saw Bouyer-Randle approach his co-worker and her fiancé earlier and overheard him threatening the couple.

He said he never saw Bouyer-Randle with a gun but observed him posturing as if he was armed. He said the person with Bouyer-Randle, who was not identified, held his hands down at his side and ""made quick furtive movements,"" the report states. The employee said that after Bouyer-Randle reportedly made his threats he saw him drive to a nearby church where they believe he threw out his gun. He said he returned to the restaurant and began to circle the building.

Officers searched the area of the church but did not find a gun, the report states.

The co-worker's fiancé told police he was parked in front of the restaurant in his truck waiting for his fiancé when a dark Chrysler 300 pulled up beside him. He said the driver of the Chrysler began hitting his truck with the Chrysler's door.

He said he told the man to stop and the man began threatening him, saying he was going to get a gun and shoot him, the report states.

The second employee said she walked outside and overheard Bouyer-Randle's companion threatening to shoot her fiancé. She said she returned to the restaurant and asked her manager to call 911.

Meanwhile, she said she saw the Chrysler 300 driving next to the Cadillac and believed the people in the two vehicles were lying in wait to shoot or attack her and her fiancé.

She said the two vehicles drove to the back of the restaurant than a short while later only the Cadillac returned and circled the business.

When officers arrived at the scene Bouyer-Randle's companion and the Chrysler 300 were gone, the report states.

Bouyer-Randle is an outside linebacker who came to Tech as a graduate transfer this past off-season from Michigan State. He has 32 tackles, which is seventh on the team, four pass breakups, which is tied for second, and one sack. He has played in all seven games, starting three.

He played extensively in the Red Raiders' 34-18 loss against TCU on Saturday afternoon in Fort Worth.

On Sunday, the Tech athletics department said it was gathering facts pertaining to the incident and would handle any discipline in accordance with its student-athlete code of conduct.

Asked Monday by A-J Media about Bouyer-Randle's status with the team, Tech coach Matt Wells said, ""Kind of to be determined right now. We're still gathering information in terms of all those facts and I'll work with (athletics director) Kirby (Hocutt) and we'll see right where it's at, exactly what the situation is. But still gathering facts right now."""
