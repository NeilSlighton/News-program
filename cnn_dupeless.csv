Nino N. Luces/Reuters A man looks at his house buried under the rubble following flash floods brought by Typhoon Goni in the Albay province of the Philippines on Sunday, November 1.

Typhoon Goni, the strongest typhoon to hit anywhere in the world this year, barreled through the south of the Philippines' main island of Luzon on Sunday, an initial government report showed.

Storm surges hit some coastal towns, while rivers overflowed and dikes were destroyed, submerging several villages in Bicol.

Over 390,000 people had fled to safer ground, including more than 345,000 to evacuation centers, raising concerns about compliance with coronavirus-related health protocols.

Goni is one of the strongest storms to hit the Philippines since 2013's Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people."

And thousands of Americans seek those vibrant colored leaves by traveling notable distances to view them.

But geography doesn't automatically prescribe vibrant colors -- weather often plays a more important role. So where has the weather been conducive for good leaf peeping this year?

Perfect foliage conditions rely on a good combination of temperatures (not too hot and not too cold) and moisture (not too wet or too dry). The problem is that some areas have experienced these extreme conditions, particularly in the West and New England.

Why drought matters

Over 75% of the West is under drought conditions. Over 80% of Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and New Hampshire are experiencing severe drought.

But some of those same New England areas witnessing drought conditions also happen to be reporting more vivid fall colors.

""This year we are seeing exceptionally vibrant fall foliage in Vermont,"" said Dr. William Keeton, a Forest Ecology and Forestry Professor at the University of Vermont. ""It is due to a combination of factors, including good tree growth last year, mild drought and both warm days and cool nights over the last month. ""

While the drought may trigger more vibrant colors, the timing may be premature.

""The colors this year are coming about two weeks earlier than normal and will probably go by fast and furiously,"" Keeton said. ""Largely, this is because the drought creates stress for the trees -- physiological stress. So from that standpoint, while the drought may enhance some of the colors, the stress is not a good thing and may be a harbinger of things to come with climate change.""

In addition to starting early, the duration of the leaf color is also likely impacted.

""In terms of fall foliage, drought can cause the leaves to change colors earlier, but they may also die and fall off earlier,"" said Kaitlyn Weber, a data analyst for Climate Central. ""Prolonged and more extreme drought can cause physical damage to trees such as root loss, slowed growth, and makes it harder for trees to protect themselves against pests and disease.""

Which is why the level of drought matters too.

Vermont, for example, is mostly in a moderate drought (level 1 out of 4), versus New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine, which are mostly in a severe drought (level 2 out of 4). And Rhode Island is almost entirely under an extreme drought (level 3 out of 4).

""A mild to moderate drought may actually enhance fall foliage to some degree, so long as it didn't lead to a lot of 'browning' or early leaf drop,"" Keeton said. ""Then again, drought one year may mean less robust leaf production the next.""

So it isn't always an instant impact. Often, the effects of droughts are delayed. Right now, 76% of Vermont is under moderate drought conditions or worse. But at this same time last year, 0% of the state was under drought conditions.

""Good tree growth last year allowed the trees to store up energy reserves and nutrients over the winter, resulting in robust leaf development this spring and summer,"" Keeton said. ""But this works the other way too...a bad drought one year can lead to poorer foliage the next.""

Extreme heat and climate change

Ideal conditions for vibrant foliage include warm days and cool nights. That encourages the production of a chemical called anthocyanin, which adds the red and purple colors in some species, like maples.

""The contrasting temperature between night and day speeds up the loss of chlorophyll from leaves, leaving behind the secondary photosynthetic pigments (carotenoids) that give us the yellow and orange colors,"" Keeton said.

However, just like a drought, severe heat can stress trees enough to cause early browning or loss of leaves. And moderate heat, or prolonged heat -- when fall feels more like an extension of summer -- can delay the change to fall colors, because the trees aren't getting the signal that fall has arrived.

""It's also possible for plants to miss the cue altogether and lose their leaves quicker,"" Weber said.

The period from June through August this year was the fourth hottest on record in the US, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Western states like Colorado and New Mexico often see a tourism boost as travelers seek out the vivid leaves of aspen and scrub oak trees. Both of those states, along with Nevada and Utah, had their hottest August on record this year. New Mexico had its second driest summer (June through August) on record.

""The causes of fall foliage are complex and actually not entirely understood,"" Keeton said. ""Drought is only one of several factors, the others being photoperiod and the contrast between daytime and nighttime temperatures in autumn. All of this just goes to show how fascinating our forest ecosystems are!""

Wildfires add another obstacle/dilemma

Wildfires will also complicate leaf peeping in Colorado and California this year. Several states are still dealing with poor air quality and hazy skies from the smoke. That haze will block your ability to see the vibrant colors.

""Currently all National Forests in the Pacific Southwest Region are closed to the public by order. There are few exceptions to these orders,"" according to the US Department of Agriculture Forest Services website

Inyo National Forest in California is closed until October 8 due to the ongoing wildfires in the region. However, the conditions remain fluid as the wildfires shift or become contained, so check each park's website to see if they have re-opened.

Current active large fires in the US

Not all areas are expected to be bad. Most of the Southeast and Midwestern regions of the country will see their fall foliage flourish this season as weather conditions have been quite favorable this year."

As the weather outside grows frightful, the fire doesn’t have to be inside to be delightful. After nearly nine months of sheltering inside, many home dwellers will be looking for ways to stay outdoors as long as possible, making outdoor heating a new necessity of 2020.

Whether you have a lush backyard, a patio or a tiny balcony, there are many ways to stay toasty this fall and winter. All it takes is a little creativity and a few investments in useful products. As event planner and space designer Joe Moller shares, it’s possible to create an outdoor heating strategy no matter your location, style and budget. Below you’ll find some ways to start your shopping, as recommended by the experts:

Outdoor fire pits

Since most folks don’t have an outdoor fireplace, the next best hygge-inspired way to heat your outdoors is via a fire pit. Cozy and pretty, both wood-burning and gas fire pits emit the warmth you need to enjoy s’mores, cocktails and conversations outdoors. (Psst: If you live in a city, make sure to check local ordinances since some zip codes don’t allow for traditional wood fire pits and only permit gas options.)

For a more rustic way of staying warm once the temperature drops, Moller recommends this sphere-shaped fire pit. “Throw a couple of those quick-start logs underneath some natural wood and you can enjoy the popping and crackling of a real fire without worrying about flying sparks,” he explains. It can also be used as a planter during the summer, making it a smart multipurpose buy.

Kingso Fire Pit ($48.99, originally $70; amazon.com)

An Amazon shopper favorite, just throw a few logs into this affordably priced fire pit and you’ve got yourself some cozy outdoor ambiance. It also comes with a spark screen and fire poker, and customers rave about how safe it feels to use. Plus, it’s small enough to lug around.

Solo Stove Ranger Fire Pit ($229.49, originally $269.99; amazon.com)

If you have a smaller area, a large fire pit might take up too much space or not be safe. That’s why this pint-size yet durable and heat-emitting fire pit is a good idea. It’s compact and light enough to take camping but strong enough to keep your whole fam outdoors in the evening. What we love the most is how simple and fast it is to clean so you can spend more time hangin’ and less time worrying about the mess.

Rather than testing your Boy Scout or Girl Scout fire-starting skills, you’d rather flip a switch and enjoy the heat. This propane gas option is not only sleek and modern for your outdoor aesthetic, but it’s super safe and warm too. Thanks to the reinforced resin tabletop design, you can set your glass of vino by the flame and soak up the crisp evening.

“This is a great little fire pit for the price,” writes one reviewer of this fire pit. “Assembly took maybe 20 minutes by myself. It’s easy to move around so you can have a fire anywhere. The actual fire pit part removes easily from the frame so that you can empty ashes easily. I also loved that it came with its own cover so I don’t have to worry about rain rusting it.”

Outdoor blankets and rugs

While a fire pit is a necessity, it may not create enough warmth for you to sit comfortably. In addition to clothing layers, outdoor blankets seal in the heat of your body. From cordless heating options to faux fur, you can match your blanket or rug to your aesthetic, so it’s both practical and stylish.

Lochas Faux Sheepskin Rug ($18.98; amazon.com)

To warm up your space in an entirely different way, turn to cozy textiles, like this faux sheepskin pelt, suggests designer Lisa Queen. When you add this to your outdoor chair before you sit down, you’re instantly piling on another layer of heat. Just make sure you take it back indoors when you’re finished since it won’t be able to sustain weather conditions, Queen says.

The Cozee Battery-Powered Heated Blanket ($249.99; amazon.com)

As Terry Lin, the co-founder and chief design officer of the outdoor living brand Outer, puts it, a blanket to keep the chill at bay is a must if you want to spend any amount of time outdoors. If you want an extended hang period but the wind is a bit too cold, consider this battery-operated heated blanket. It heats up thoroughly in a half hour and can last up to five hours, which would make the price worth it for anyone who’s always chilly.

Let’s be honest: A plush down comforter is just about perfect for snuggling on the couch. Sadly, they’re far too heavy and bulky to carry outside…until now. The Rumpl down puffy blanket packs up tiny but opens to the perfect-size throw for outdoor lounging.

Outdoor heaters and lamps

Queen recommends mounting one or two of these heaters under a trellis or on the side of a structure for warmth that stays out of your way. “Nothing on the floor to manage, so great for small spaces too,” she explains. If you aren’t exactly experienced in wiring, it could be worthwhile to hire an electrician to set this up safely.

Just like what you experience at restaurants, this floor heater will keep you warm outdoors all year round, Queen says. Not only is it easy to set up and operate, but you can just move over the propane tank from your grill. “Wheel them nearby your lounge seating or dining areas and get ready to snuggle up,” she recommends.

Outdoor heating accessories

In addition to fire pits, blankets and heaters, there are other ways to retain warmth and comfort in the great outdoors. Here are a few ideas:

Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug ($99.95; amazon.com)

Technically speaking, it won’t keep you warm, but it will keep that morning cup of joe from going cold. Lin recommends this as an additional accessory for your heating investments since you can enjoy coffee on your patio at your leisure. “It will ensure that your beverage stays hot, and it warms you from the inside,” he continues. “Plus, the mug is controlled by an app on your phone and will hold the temperature of your choosing.”

K&H Pet Lectro Soft Heated Dog Bed (starting at $26.72, originally starting at $39.99; amazon.com)

K&H Pet Lectro Soft Heated Dog Bed PHOTO: Amazon

Sure, your pup does wear a fur coat all year long, but they’d appreciate a little TLC through this heated dog bed. Since they never leave your side, Lin says to put this next to your chair so the whole family can savor your outdoor oasis.

Zippo Rechargeable Hand Warmer (starting at $18.01, originally starting at $24.95; amazon.com)

If you’re someone who tends to run cold, you may need more heat layers than the rest of your crew. Consider investing in two of these rechargeable hand warmers that come with six heat settings. In addition to using it in your personal outdoor space, it’s also ideal for skiing or walking around in wintry weather.

Ocoopa Rechargeable Hand Warmer (starting at $25.99, originally starting at $32.99; amazon.com)

Wildfires are ravaging many areas in the West, especially in California.

As of Wednesday, October 28, at least 50 large fires were burning in the West, including 18 in California, where dry, windy conditions and record-breaking high temperatures have been fueling flames for weeks. Fires burning in Oregon have destroyed more than 1 million acres in the state.

More than 4 million acres have burned across California. In terms of acres burned, this year is the worst in the state's history.

7,2020-10-08 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/world/antarctic-ozone-hole-scn-trnd/index.html,The Antarctic ozone hole is one of the largest and deepest in recent years,"(CNN) The ozone hole that typically grows over the Antarctic each September and October has become one of the largest and deepest in recent years -- just one year after scientists recorded its smallest size since it was discovered .

The 2020 ozone hole grew rapidly from mid-August and had grown to about 9.2 million square miles when it peaked in early October, according to a statement from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

It then shrank to about 8.9 million square miles -- more than twice the size of the United States -- covering almost the entire Antarctic continent, the agency said.

The ozone layer in our atmosphere protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation.

""There is much variability in how far ozone hole events develop each year. The 2020 ozone hole resembles the one from 2018, which also was a quite large hole, and is definitely in the upper part of the pack of the last fifteen years or so,"" said CAMS Director Vincent-Henri Peuch in a statement.

The depletion is directly related to the temperatures in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer sits, because the polar stratospheric clouds that play an important role in the process only form at temperatures below -78 degrees Celsius (-108.4 Fahrenheit).

Ice crystals in the clouds react with compounds in the atmosphere that can then rapidly destroy ozone when they are exposed to sunlight, the WMO said.

NASA said last year's ozone hole was particularly small because of unusual weather patterns that cause warmer stratospheric temperatures over Antarctica.

The Antarctic ozone hole will shrink as temperatures warm up in the Southern Hemisphere, where it's spring, and will return to normal by December, the WMO said.

Peuch said this year's data confirms the need to continue enforcing the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which banned the emission of ozone depleting chemicals.

It banned chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were common in refrigerators, aerosol cans and other products before scientists realized they were damaging to the ozone layer.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that not only was it the hottest summer, but it was the globe's third hottest three-month season on record and August was the second-hottest month ever.

A map of the world plotted with some of the most significant weather and climate events that occurred during August 2020. For more details, see the NOAA report at http://bit.ly/GlobalAug2020.

NOAA's monthly global report said that August 2020 was only behind August 2016 as the hottest month on record.

However, when it comes to the Northern Hemisphere, it's a different story. August 2020 beat August 2016 as the hottest month ever recorded with a temperature average of 2.14 degrees Fahrenheit over the 20th century average of 60.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

Globally, the top 10 warmest Augusts have all occurred since 1998, according to the agency.

Abiy last week launched a military campaign in the province, saying forces loyal to leaders there had attacked a military base and attempted to steal equipment.

Abiy accuses the leaders of Tigray of undermining his democratic reforms.

Government fighter jets have since been bombing targets in the region, which borders Sudan and Eritrea. Aid workers on Sunday reported heavy fighting in several parts of the region, with at least six dead and dozens wounded.

Also on Sunday, Abiy named a new chief of the army, a new intelligence chief and a new federal police commissioner and foreign minister, changes that analysts said brought close allies into top posts as the conflict escalates.

The opposition boycotted the October 31 ballot after Ouattara decided to run for a third term in a country that has a two-term limit. When results showed Ouattara won with 94%, former president Henri Konan Bedie and ex-prime minister Pascal Affi N'Guessan said they did not recognize the vote and announced a transition government.

Ouattara, in power since 2010, says approval of a new constitution in 2016 restarted his mandate and allowed him to run again.

The standoff has raised the risk of long-term instability in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer and one of Africa's fastest growing economies.

The creation of a breakaway government was ""intended to attack the authority of the state,"" lead prosecutor Richard Adou told reporters.

Its arrival could hardly have been better timed because, just two months later, the coronavirus epidemic reached the Horn of Africa country.

Since then Medipark Diagnostics, which he runs with five other doctors who pooled $1 million to buy equipment, has become a linchpin of the country's creaking, donor-supported health infrastructure.

Hospitals in the battle-scarred city that once had to wait weeks for blood test results now use the lab to test for conditions including HIV and hepatitis.

But, as the Somali government has acknowledged, it is in the fight against COVID-19 that Medipark has made its most visible mark.

""We had the supplies and our molecular pathologists were in touch with other pathologists doing COVID-19 tests in other countries,"" said Dini, 37, whose studies took him to India and China.

Until July, Medipark was the only private lab in the city testing for the virus, but since then its technicians have trained government health workers to conduct tests.

""We were needed ... and we were appreciated,"" he said.

Medipark has arranged import pipelines of reagents needed for tests, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test used for COVID-19. It employs staff from Kenya, Lebanon and India to operate and maintain equipment imported from Europe, Asia and the United States.

Aisha Abdi Mohamed, a laboratory technician, uses a microscope inside the Medipark Diagnostics lab that runs tests for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Mogadishu, Somalia October 14, 2020.

Somalia has been plagued by conflict since 1991, and outbreaks of diseases such as cholera are common.

More than 2 million people do not have enough food. Many live in crowded, unsanitary camps, creating fears COVID-19 could scythe through a vulnerable population.

So far, that hasn't happened. The health ministry has recorded 4,229 infections and 107 deaths in the pandemic though, with large swathes of the country off limits due to the fighting, that is likely to be an undercount.

Medipark lab is next to Hotel Shamo, where a 2009 bombing killed 19 people during a medical student graduation. Dini was there and the memories are still raw, but he and his fellow doctors are proud to be back home.

""I am glad to help my community and make a difference,"" said Ali Muse, who practised in Rwanda and South Sudan before returning two years ago to help open the lab."

It's been an extraordinary year for archaeological discoveries at the UNESCO World Heritage Site, where separate finds have unearthed scores of sarcophagi and a host of artifacts, including an obelisk and a unique, bejeweled statue of the god Nefertum.

This, following the reopening of the 4,700-year-old Djoser's Step Pyramid in March after a 14-year, $6.6 million restoration.

In early October, 59 sarcophagi, around 2,500 years old , were uncovered. Wonderfully preserved with their original colors and hieroglyphs, their unveiling was an opportunity to reach a prized audience: tourists. Alongside press, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities invited dozens of foreign ambassadors, who subsequently shared images and details across social media.

""The discovery entered into the hearts of everyone all over the world,"" former minister of antiquities Zahi Hawass tells CNN.

""I think the ambassadors really sent a message to their countries about the pleasures of Egypt, because we need tourists to come back.""

Tourism in Egypt had been growing in recent years, according to Kevin Graham, Egypt editorial manager at research and advisory company Oxford Business Group (OBG). ""At the beginning of 2020 there was the expectation that this growth trend would continue,"" he tells CNN.

Then the pandemic happened. International flights were suspended in March along with the closing of archaeological sites and museums. Commercial flights didn't resume until July.

OBG calculates tourism contributed over 9% of Egypt's GDP in 2019, and while domestic tourism has continued to an extent, Graham adds, international tourism plummeted. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its forecast for tourism expenditure in Egypt this fiscal year from $17.8 billion to $2.7 billion

Egypt has had more than 107,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,200 deaths from Covid-19 at the time of writing, and more than 1,00 cases in the past week, per John Hopkins University. New deaths and cases peaked in June.

While the pandemic rumbles on, the tourism sector is regrouping. In July, a smattering of attractions reopened including the Great Pyramids of Giza , along with hotels issued with government safety certificates indicating they met World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. In September, more archaeological sites reopened, and the Egyptian government announced further measures to support the sector, including extending visa fee exemptions for tourist hotspots Luxor, Aswan, the Red Sea and South Sinai until April 2021 , and delaying repayments on utility bills and debts for tourism-related companies.

Amr Karim, general manager for Travco Trave l, one of Egypt's largest travel operators, says after a ""drastic decline,"" the past three months have seen a ""gradual increase in beach holidays,"" with bookings coming from across Europe.

Visitors to Egypt are currently required to present a negative PCR test certificate on arrival, taken no more than 72 hours prior to their flight departure, although arrivals at some airports on the coast are allowed to take a $30 PCR test then quarantine until they receive their results.

Travco is implementing WHO regulations and is disinfecting hotel rooms, public spaces and vehicles, while staff are using face masks, sanitizing tools and social distancing. Karim notes the proportion of elderly travelers is down while there's been a rise in travelers under 50, and that tourists are, by and large, sticking to their hotels.

He anticipates a ""boom"" in tourism to ancient sites by the third quarter of 2021.

""The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has been exerting monumental efforts in the last few years to enhance and shed light on Egypt's archaeological treasures,"" Karim says, citing new archaeological sites, events including the parade of 22 royal mummies from the Egyptian Museum to their new home at National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, and the construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM).

the site of the Pyramids of Giza. The treasures within will include an 83-ton, 20-meter (66 feet) granite statue of Ramses the Great and over 5,000 artifacts from King Tutankhamun's burial chamber -- the first time the blockbuster haul will be displayed in the same place. After years of groundwork, these efforts will culminate in the opening of the GEM in 2021. Cairo's vast new museum -- nearly half a million square meters and built at a cost of over $1 billion -- is nearing completion close tothe site of the Pyramids of Giza. The treasures within will include an 83-ton, 20-meter (66 feet) granite statue of Ramses the Great and over 5,000 artifacts from King Tutankhamun's burial chamber -- the first time the blockbuster haul will be displayed in the same place.

It is ""the most important cultural project in the world,"" declares Hawass, and many roads lead back to it: the 59 sarcophagi from Saqqara will be transferred to the GEM, where they will be displayed opposite another large collection of wooden coffins found in Luxor in 2019

But if the pandemic continues, there's no guarantee that tourists will be there to see it open in the numbers many in the sector and beyond will have been counting on.

Back in August, the IMF predicted tourism would return to pre-crisis levels in Egypt by the second half of 2022 . Graham says in contrast to historical dips in tourism, forecasting is ""not necessarily (linked to) what's going on in Egypt,"" pointing instead to the pandemic response in European nations and their return quarantine policies as deciding factors as to whether people will travel.

""It is hard to make any predictions in the status quo,"" says Karim. ""It all depends on the medical revelations and vaccines in progress to combat the Covid-19 pandemic ... We are hoping for the best.""

Hawass remains bullish -- understandable, given he's been involved with the GEM for two decades -- and is optimistic 2021 will be better than 2020."

The vessel was carrying about 200 people, according to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) statement. It added that, ""according to media sources, the Senegalese and Spanish navies, and fishermen who were nearby rescued 59 people and retrieved the remains of 20 others.""

According to the IOM, the boat was bound for Spain's Canary Islands but caught fire a few hours after departing Mbour, a coastal town in western Senegal, before capsizing near Saint-Louis, on the country's northwest coast.

""The IOM is deeply saddened by this recent tragedy, which follows four shipwrecks recorded in the Central Mediterranean last week and another in the English Channel,"" the statement said. The number of migrant boat departures from West Africa to the Canary Islands has more than quadrupled this year to 11,000, according to IOM estimates.

""We call for unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth,"" IOM Senegal Chief of Mission Bakary Doumbia said in the statement.

The Ukrainian tourists were attacked by a shark while swimming in the Ras Mohammed National Reserve on Sunday, Ukraine's state agency for tourism development said in a statement.

The tourists were rushed to Sharm International Hospital for treatment: the mother had deep bite wounds, while the child had an amputated upper limb below the elbow and suffered deep wounds on his back, the statement said, citing the Ukrainian embassy in Egypt.

Alll activities have been suspended in the vicinity of the Sharm El-Sheikh Ras Mohammed diving spot, Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram news agency reported Tuesday.

Five people, including the two Ukrainian tourists and one tour guide, were injured in the attack, according to Al-Ahram.

The US Embassy in the East African country said there had been ""credible allegations of significant election-related fraud and intimidation"" in Wednesday's poll in which voters were electing a president and lawmakers.

The vote was marred by allegations of arrests of candidates and protesters, restrictions on agents of political parties to access polling stations, multiple voting, pre-ticking of ballots and widespread blocking of social media, the US Embassy said.

Elections took place simultaneously both in Tanzania and in the country's semi-autonomous state of Zanzibar, an Indian Ocean archipelago.

Demonstrators took part in daily protests across Nigeria for nearly two weeks over widespread claims of kidnapping, harassment and extortion by a police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).

The eight-person Judicial Panel of Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration will look at the claims against SARS, which was disbanded on October 11 in response to the protests , and also investigate last Tuesday's deadly incident at Lekki Toll Gate.

Tuesday saw only two complainants give testimony after the panel appeared over two hours late. Both cases related to historical SARS brutality and not recent killings.

The first petitioner, Okoye Agu, said that in 2012 he spent 47 days in SARS detention where officials tortured him and extracted two teeth. He said his wife and mother, who came to try to help him, were also beaten.

Agu also said his property and car were sold by SARS officials, and even though a court awarded him N10m ($26,000) in 2016, he hasn't been compensated at all.

The second petitioner spoke briefly before his case was adjourned until next week so the police commissioner could be present.

Condemnation of Lekki Toll Gate violence

Amnesty International told CNN that at least 12 demonstrators had been shot dead at Lekki Toll Gate and another site last Tuesday by Army soldiers, who then took the bodies away. The Nigerian army claimed on Twitter that these reports were ""fake news.""

The human rights group said at least 56 people have died across the country since the protests began, with about 38 killed last Tuesday alone.

Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday that only two people were killed by the military. CCTV footage from last Tuesday's incident will be part of the tribunal's investigation but is not yet known if it will be made public.

Despite condemnation of the killings from the United States, United Nations and others, Sanwo-Olu insisted there was no international pressure on the government or the president to make reforms.

In addition to Tuesday's session, the tribunal will also hold hearings on Friday and Saturday this week and the public have been invited to submit claims to the court.

It's the only action government have taken to address the Lekki Toll Gate violence and is seen as a litmus test for the independence of the judiciary. There are two young protesters on the panel who will represent the youth voice.

The anti-SARS marches have recently morphed into protests campaigning for police reform and an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.

The physical protests have ended but a coalition of protest groups vows to continue online. Many of the protesters said they have received multiple threats and there has been an attempt to blame them for the chaos, looting, and burning that followed the shootings last Tuesday.

""The ones that died are the real heroes,"" said DJ Switch, who streamed a live video on Instagram at Lekki Toll Gate when the shooting started. ""The giant is asleep. The custodians of the country, the leaders of the country, they're tiptoeing; they don't want to wake the giant up, the giants are the people."

They marched in tens of thousands chanting ""Enough is Enough"" against police brutality and violence.

The group's initial demands were for a notorious police unit known as the Special Anti Robbery Squad, or SARS, to be shut down, but the marches have since morphed into protests campaigning for police reform and an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.

One of the popular chants used during the protests was ""soro soke,"" which means ""speak up"" in the country's Yoruba language.

It has become ""an EndSARS battle cry... a tone of rebellion, a note of valid belligerency and a chant of unification in the Nigerian struggle against police brutality and terrible governance,"" wrote Motolani Alake, a journalist for Nigeria's Pulse newspaper

Economic inequality has reached extreme levels in Nigeria, according to the United Nation Human Rights Commission, while Oxfam reported that in 2019 close to 70% of the country's population lives below the poverty line.

Young people under 30 make up more than 40% of Nigeria's population. They face severe hardship and chronic unemployment. According to Chatham House , ""If Nigeria's unemployed youth were its own country, it would be larger than Tunisia or Belgium.""

Now with this protest movement, they are making their voices heard and speaking up against the violence, harassment, and extortion they say they have endured at the hands of SARS officers.

The SARS unit was set up in 1992 to fight armed robbery and was given wide-ranging powers. Many of the officers do not wear uniforms or nametags that identify themselves.

There have been numerous complaints that they had now turned on the citizens and were perpetrating the very crimes that they were set up to combat.

Amnesty International documented 82 cases of police brutality in Nigeria between 2017 and 2020. In a damning report published in June 2020 the human rights organization said people in SARS custody were ""subjected to a variety of methods of torture including hanging, mock execution, beating, punching and kicking, burning with cigarettes, waterboarding, near-asphyxiation with plastic bags, forcing detainees to assume stressful bodily positions and sexual violence.""

but the catalyst for the recent nationwide protests came in early October when reports surfaced in local media that police had attacked a Complaints about SARS are not new. People have been speaking out online since 2017 about the unit, and there have been several, unsuccessful attempts by the government to scrap it,but the catalyst for the recent nationwide protests came in early October when reports surfaced in local media that police had attacked a young man and driven off in his luxury jeep.

It sparked the use of the #EndSARS hashtag and two popular musicians, Runtown and Falz, decided to hold an offline march to air their grievances.

Falz, whose real name is Folarin Falana, said they were expecting ""a handful of people,"" but were surprised when hundreds, including other celebrities, turned up.

""Everyone is dissatisfied and the government's failing to react to this level of outcry is sheer disregard for the people. this administration is very insensitive,"" Falz told CNN at the time.

Soon, the movement mushroomed organically around the country as years of frustrations and anger boiled over among the disenfranchised youth.

""Nigeria is facing a reckoning, one that is long overdue,"" said Yetunde Omede, a professor of global affairs and politics in New York.

""With a growing youth bulge of under 30 years old, Nigeria can no longer ignore the demands of young people.""

During the protests, participants erected tents and DJ booths at various sites across the country.

Some camped overnight outside the Lagos State Assembly, while others chanted 'Solidarity forever,' sang the national anthem repeatedly and held multi-faith prayer sessions as well as a ""festival of lights,"" to honor the dead, held at the now infamous Lekki toll gate.

""This is an awakening of Generation Y, who are under 35, and will have a significant impact on the political landscape, analyst Amaka Anku, who heads the Africa Practice at Eurasia Group, told CNN.

""I think the movement will define political consciousness. It will lead to a higher turnout in 2023 and helped define campaign issues for the 2023 election,"" Anku added.

The movement itself was not just about police brutality, says Omede.

""It is years of ongoing social trauma caused by inadequate healthcare systems and institutions of education, systemic corruption, nepotism, electoral fraud, poverty and more,"" she said.

""The EndSARS movement was the tipping point.""

Not surprisingly, the EndSARS protests in Nigeria have been compared to the Black Lives Matter fight against police brutality in the US.

It has attracted massive global support with solidarity protests in UK, US, Germany, and other parts of the world.

Celebrities such as Kanye West, John Boyega and Rihanna among a host of others gave their support, shining a global spotlight on the #EndSARS hashtag.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted about the movement, while his platform gave verified blue tick status to some who were prominent in it and created an #EndSARS emoji symbol.

There was no discernible leadership in the decentralized structure of the movement and the young people were quick to reject any person who tried to insert themselves as a leader because they feared being compromised.

A feminist coalition

Women have taken a leading role in powering the marches and the phenomenal Feminist coalition raised nearly $400,000 to fund the different protests springing up around the country.

They posted real-time accounting of their expenditure on Twitter and quickly won praise for their openness and accountability, something Nigerians have long demanded from their leaders.

In addition, the movement provided free medical assistance for those injured in the protests and rapid response volunteer legal assistance to help free those arrested, while also doing some CSR along the way, including raising money to buy prosthetic limbs for two amputees who joined the marches on crutches.

One of the protesters, who wanted to be known only as CM, because she says she has received multiple threats, told CNN: ""We are united as Nigerian youths. It has been the most, scary fearful, heart breaking time but regardless of class, tribe and all of that, we came together to say we don't want to be killed, extorted, harassed, brutalized.

""One thing I have gotten out of this entire thing is that the moment people come together, they can achieve anything,"" she added.

The global support and strength of the #EndSARS movement clearly rattled the establishment who have responded with brute force and a level of violence that has led to anger and global condemnation.

On Tuesday, October 20, protesters sitting and singing the national anthem say they were barricaded on either side of the Lekki toll gate and fired upon by Nigerian security forces.

Figures from Amnesty say that at least 12 people died.

DJ Switch was live-streaming the protests on her Instagram page when the shooting happened.

She told CNN: ""I'm heartbroken. There was no warning. We just heard gunshots and the soldiers came in guns blazing. It's the worst thing I have seen in my life. They were just shooting like we were goats and chickens.""

The Nigerian army has posted that the reports are ""fake news."" The army has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CNN.

Even before Tuesday's shooting, protesters had faced teargas, water cannons, and live ammunition during their peaceful marches.

Even as Nigeria's Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu announced the dissolution of SARS -- for at least the fourth time in four years -- protesters were being dispersed with tear gas, water cannons, and live bullets.

However, few can forget the image of her, fists clenched in the air, and standing defiantly as she faced down the police in the country's capital Abuja on October 10.

""I raised up my hand and clenched fist and started walking back slowly, they were shooting at me,"" Yesufu said.

""I braced myself for the impact and they were throwing tear gas. I said to myself, 'no matter what I am going to go down standing'. I was bracing myself for the pain that would come from any impact,"" she added.

CNN reached out to the Nigerian police force for comment on the allegations against the officers. Lagos state spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi said all complaints against its officers are carefully investigated and appropriate sanctions applied to offenders.

Several states across the country have also instituted judicial panels to investigate allegations against police officers.

A government under pressure

Following days of silence, President Buhari addressed the nation on Thursday but failed to address Tuesday's military attack on peaceful protesters.

Instead, he issued a thinly veiled threat to young people to get off the streets and stop the protests. The speech was poorly received and many said it failed to show empathy or any accountability for the deaths of Nigerians.

No empathy. No hope. No apology. No accountability. #EndSARS — Dr. Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) October 22, 2020

In the aftermath of the speech, many Nigerians said they were left feeling deflated and in typical fashion, they responded online with humor to mask their disappointment.

Soon, ""Canada visa,"" ""it is finished"" and ""International passport"" became trending topics on Twitter.

As for the End Sars movement, they are taking Buhari's message seriously and say they are halting the physical protests to focus on online agitation.

CM told CNN: ""Protests have ended but we still have a lot of questions about people who lost their lives. The movement is not ended.""

""Now we have to think about it a little more strategically because we don't want people to lose their lives anymore. We don't want anyone else to be in danger.""

After Buhari's speech, the Coalition of Protest Groups released a statement saying they were still determined to press on for a better Nigeria.

""For the sake of the wellbeing of our comrades and ordinary citizens being adversely affected by this, we will deprioritize the physical protests, for now,"" the statement said.

""But, for the sake of those who died, before the protests, during the protests, and at the hands of Soldiers at the Lekki Toll Gate -- people who the government has largely refused to acknowledge, THE STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUE.""

The movement, which has been described as ""hydra-headed"" may have had one of its heads cut off for now. But it has certainly now a force to be reckoned with, and one that has given Nigeria's youth a chance to be heard."

Protesters have been rallying across Nigeria to demand police reform and bring the government's attention to recurring police brutality.

The outcry has been a result of years of anger over the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a Nigerian police unit whose officers were accused of kidnapping, harassing and extorting young people of the West African country.

The protests led to swift change as authorities disbanded the SARS unit and replaced it with the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team. However, the news was met with skepticism among demonstrators who continued to march and call for a complete overhaul and reform of the police.

Although the demonstrations have been peaceful, at least 10 protesters have been killed by the police, according to the rights group Amnesty International."

Infectious disease specialists caution that cases might be much higher than reported due to a lack of testing and struggling health care systems.

But three CNN Heroes working in Africa halted their usual efforts to dedicate their time to slowing the spread of the virus.

'It is an incredible responsibility'

In Ethiopia -- where the number of active cases and deaths have been on the rise since mid-June -- 2019 CNN Hero of the Year Freweini Mebrahtu has shifted gears during the pandemic.

Mebrahtu's factory normally manufactures reusable menstrual pads for girls in Ethiopia, allowing them to stay in school. Through partner organization Dignity Period , she helps distribute the pads and raise awareness on the issue.

Freweini Mebrahtu temporarily transformed her business to provide -- and push for -- Covid-19 safety measures in Ethiopia.

Since March, however, Mebrahtu has been working to manufacture masks and get them into the hands of those who need them most.

""We have produced over 50,000 cloth masks to help out the most vulnerable women and children in our community,"" she said.

She and her team distribute the masks along the main thoroughfare of Mekelle, a capital city in northern Ethiopia. Many women sell fruit and vegetables on this street and are in contact with people all day long, making masks essential for their safety.

""We're talking about a fundamental lifestyle change for our communities,"" Mebrahtu said. ""Life here is very much communal, so we are trying to maintain social wants at a distance.""

To that end, she also speaks out to the public about the importance of masks and social distance.

""We have culture that puts high value on its elders,"" Mebrahtu said. ""So, my age and the recognition for our work from CNN Heroes, it seems like people have time for what I have to say. It is an incredible responsibility and I am trying my best to be worthy of this.""

Safari Doctors respond to Covid-19

In Kenya's remote coastal areas, the reality of battling the pandemic exists alongside the struggle of living in poverty.

Umra Omar sees these struggles firsthand. She and her nonprofit, Safari Doctors , travel by air, sea and land to bring free medical care to people living along the country's remote coastline.

Umra Omar and her team are bringing medical care and crucial awareness to remote areas of Kenya.

""Where we work, jobs are definitely what we call 'casual labor,' as somebody going out to look for their daily bread that very same day that it's needed,"" said Omar, a 2016 CNN Hero. ""So, the Covid-19 pandemic has definitely put a big dent on that one. It's like, 'I might die of hunger before I die of corona.'""

Omar and her team began social distancing measures, added wash stations at their clinics and wear extra protective gear. They also are spreading crucial awareness throughout the community.

""There's a lot of misinformation that it's a disease that's not going to come all the way to the rural areas,"" Omar said. ""Information sharing is the number one key. We set up all the billboards in the entryways of Lamu covering the messaging around Covid-19.""

Even through this difficult time, Omar has seen a positive impact.

""The biggest silver lining for us is more rigorous hand-washing campaigns that are seeing a reduction of cases like diarrhea,"" Omar said. ""And seeing how the young kids now really are thorough in hygiene,""

Protecting fellow Cameroonians

In Cameroon, 2013 CNN Hero Dr. Georges Bwelle and his nonprofit, ASCOVIME , bring free medical and surgical clinics to hundreds of thousands of people in rural villages.

But when Covid-19 hit, Bwelle and his team knew it was unsafe for crowds to gather for their clinics. So, they found new ways to keep their fellow Cameroonians healthy -- by providing supplies, protective gear and knowledge.

Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team are providing supplies and protective gear to those needing it most in Cameroon.

""We decided to stop our mobile clinic to focus only (on sensitizing the) population about Covid-19, about how to apply the protective measure,"" Bwelle said. ""And offer to all people that we meet protective kits.""

Their kits contain essential items such as hand sanitizer, soap, masks and food. To date, the group has distributed them to 35,000 people and 7,000 health care workers all over Cameroon.

The organization focuses on getting kits to the most vulnerable, including those living in orphanages and nursing homes and internationally displaced people.

""I think ASCOVIME more will contribute to reduce the number of patients with coronavirus,"" Bwelle said. ""I hope this work will reduce the number of people who die due to coronavirus. That's my dream."""

The restrictions prohibit shaking hands, not wearing a mask in a public place, seating more than three people at a table or not keeping ""two adult steps"" -- around six feet -- apart.

""Now it is as if COVID is no longer there, the public is not taking care,"" Health Minister Lia Tadesse tweeted on Thursday. ""This will cause a possible increase in the spread of the disease and might be a threat to the nation.""

Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation and a regional powerhouse, declared a state of emergency in April to curb the spread of the pandemic. It was lifted in September.

The health ministry has recorded 91,118 Covid-19 cases, 1,384 deaths and 44,506 recoveries so far.

The new test is cheaper than other PCR tests -- the most common type of test -- and can give results in less than 40 minutes, the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) said.

The diagnostic test kit will cost less than $25 and samples can be analyzed using a mobile machine that can be operated by low-skilled personnel with minimal training, the agency said.

""We saw the need for more testing outfits, especially one that can give results in a short time because hospitals were refusing to treat patients without Covid-19 results,"" Babatunde Salako, the director of NIMR, told CNN.

""The machine we use is not the common PCR one. We bought the machine and adapted the kit that we developed to work with this machine. It is meant for diagnosis of other pathogens,"" Salako said.

The pandemic has made her work more dangerous,"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series.

Lagos, Nigeria -- At the start of each day, Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru and her team put on gloves, facemasks and other personal protective equipment to see their patients.

They're not treating people for Covid-19, but they are on the frontline of the pandemic, working at the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), a rape crisis center in Lagos, Nigeria.

Wearing protective gear is the new reality for crisis center workers, like DaSilva-Ibru.

""We change these kits each time we see a survivor as we are mindful of the risk of transmission of the virus between the survivor and us and the cross-contamination between a survivor and the next,"" she told CNN.

US-trained gynecologist DaSilva-Ibru has spent most of her career treating hundreds of sexual violence victims but it was the growing scale of the crisis in Nigeria that prompted her to set up WARIF in 2016.

The clinic in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, provides medical treatment, legal assistance therapy and space for rape victims and survivors of sexual abuse to get back on their feet.

One in four Nigerian girls has been the victim of sexual violence, according to UN estimates but DaSilva-Ibru says the numbers are higher as many cases go unreported due to the stigma attached.

In recent weeks, two high profile cases of gender-based violence have brought Nigerian women out onto the streets demanding change.

Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, a 22-year-old microbiology student, was found half-naked in a pool of blood in a local church where she had gone to study after the Covid-19 lockdown left universities across the country shut.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Her family said her attackers raped her and the student died while being treated at the hospital. A few days later, another student, Barakat Bello, was allegedly raped and killed during a robbery at her home, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

She says her work with survivors of sexual violence has become more critical during the outbreak, with restrictions to curb the virus from spreading fueling a surge in calls.

It's a story echoed in other parts of the region, as authorities grapple with a growing number of Covid-19 cases and the impact restrictions are having on women.

DaSilva-Ibru said she initially closed the center after authorities locked down the city in March, she had to reconsider the decision as the organization became inundated with SOS messages from sexual violence victims and their guardians.

Staff operating the 24-hour helpline at the center also reported a 64% increase in calls during this period, according to DaSilva-Ibru.

""Our phones were ringing. Women were calling and desperately asking how we can help them, these were women in fear of their lives, as many have now been forced into quarantine with their abusers, in an already volatile environment,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

For the center to re-open, DaSilva-Ibru said she had to source PPE, face masks and other protective gear personally and when that was not enough, the center launched an online appeal for funds from donors to buy the equipment at no cost to survivors, she said.

""We carry out forensic examinations on survivors and our frontline health workers who triage and examine patients are in close proximity to the survivors. As much as we need to carry out our duties, we also need to ensure our workers are adequately protected,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

The challenges Ibru faces to keep the center open, doesn't compare to what sexual violence victims have experienced as a result of this pandemic, she said.

DaSilva-Ibru recalls a woman who told staff at the center that her male friend had raped her in her home during the lockdown.

Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru.

""The first day we re-opened, we attended to women who had walked many miles in spite of the mandatory lockdown to get to the center. These are women who had been terrorized in their homes,"" she added.

""She (a survivor) had repeatedly been calling (the center) to find out how she could get help. She feared she might have contracted HIV and wanted to be tested,"" Ibru said.

Speaking to CNN, the woman, who didn't want to use her name to protect her identity, said a co-worker raped her after he came to her apartment unannounced in April.

The young banker said she had previously rebuffed his attempts to visit, but on that Sunday afternoon in April, he showed up at her doorstep.

""He's a friend, not a stranger, so I opened the door for him. I was still asking him what was so urgent that made him leave his home. He said he wanted to check up on me and I told him he could have done that over the phone,"" she told CNN.

But a few minutes into his visit, the conversation became uncomfortable between them.

""He kept coming towards me, and when I told him to stop, he put his hand over my mouth and pinned me on the floor,"" she said.

She says he apologized after raping her and hurriedly left her house.

The survivor told CNN she did not make a police complaint because she was worried about the stigma and strain that the rape might have on her parents.

A friend she confided in told her to reach out to the Lagos Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team who put survivors in touch with treatment centers for help.

After several calls to the centers on their website, she was referred to WARIF

When she went to the clinic, she says staff ran some tests and placed her on Post Exposure Prophylaxis, a HIV prevention treatment for possible exposure.

""Sometimes I get really angry, and sometimes I feel numb,"" she said, reflecting on the assault.

She says she was sick every night for 28 days because of the drugs.

""...even though the doctor prepared me for the side effect, it has not been easy,"" she told CNN.

Gender-based violence is a problem in many countries, but the coronavirus pandemic has worsened the situation.

The UN says the raft of measures deployed by governments to fight the pandemic have led to economic hardship, stress, and fear -- conditions that lead to violence against women and girls.

Equality Now Regional Coordinator in Africa Judy Gitau told CNN that the wave of unemployment and school closures has put victims in a precarious situation.

The government enforced strict stay-at-home orders that closed businesses and schools across the West African nation to curb the spread of the virus, she said.

The restrictions made schoolgirls vulnerable to abuse as some were assaulted in their homes by relatives, and at the same time, a majority of girls from low-income families were coerced to exchange sex for money for food, Gitau said.

""Many of them wound up pregnant but the evidence became available when people were plugging back to life as they knew it as a normal society,"" she said.

Gitau says authorities must know that perpetrators often take advantage of the strict measures to abuse victims without arousing much suspicion.

As state resources are being re-focused to tackle the spread of coronavirus, law enforcement agencies should also respond quickly to reports of abuse and create shelters for victims in need of immediate rescue, she said.

But placing women in shelters, especially in countries battling an outbreak, comes with the additional burden of proof, according to DaSilva-Ibru who said shelters in Lagos city are asking survivors to take coronavirus tests before they can be admitted to prevent infection in their facilities.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Authorities in Lagos designated gender-based violence services essential in May as it eased lockdown into curfews to allow service providers to get to work more smoothly, DaSilva-Ibru said.

The police force says it has now deployed more officers to its stations across the country to respond to the ""increasing challenges of sexual assaults and domestic/gender-based violence linked with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic."" And last week, governors across the country resolved to declare a state of emergency on rape , according to the Nigerian Governor's Forum (NGF).

It's the first time federal and state authorities are coming out with a united voice to condemn gender violence, DaSilva-Ibru said and it validates the outcry of women in the country and the scale of the problem in Nigeria, she added.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries,"" DaSilva-Ibru said.

""In Nigeria, it has become a national crisis that needs urgent attention. I am pleased that this has been recognized."""
28,2020-10-10 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/10/africa/mental-health-religious-treatment-nigeria/index.html,"Chained and locked up, why some Nigerians turn to religion first to treat the mentally ill","Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) When Alvan Godwin suffered a psychotic episode linked to schizophrenia in November 2018, his parents took him to church for prayers. His mother was of the opinion that his illness was a 'spiritual attack' linked to evil spirits.

""My mum thought it was something spiritual from her side of the family. So they took me for prayers with the hope that I'd be cured of whatever was wrong,"" he told CNN.

""My aunt advised my dad that they should take me to camp for prayers against evil spirits. I remember I was laying down on the ground and people were all over me praying. I didn't want to react but the prayer wasn't working,"" Godwin said.

He added that when they realized on the way back home from camp that the expected healing didn't happen, they brought in another pastor to pray for him at home.

In parts of Nigeria, it is common to attribute mental illness to supernatural factors such as witchcraft or repercussion for sins against God, according to a report in the Integrative Journal of Global Health.

As a result, people with perceived symptoms of disorders are believed to be possessed or in need of unorthodox healing from traditional healing centers, and at Christian and Islamic faith-based facilities.

At the time Godwin was 18 and he recalls being overwhelmed with fear, hearing voices and crying in distress.

""I felt irritation all over my body. The sound of the fan in the room made me paranoid, I felt like it was rolling too fast and it would cut off and kill me. There were so many confusing voices talking to me in my head,"" he said.

Godwin's family doctor eventually referred him to a specialist after hearing about his symptoms, ""that's when we went to the psychiatric hospital,"" he said.

In his case, he was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and placed on drugs. ""I was so relieved to know what was going on with me. My parents too were relieved knowing it was nothing spiritual,"" he said.

Nigerian police rescued more than 300 people - mostly children -- held in ""dehumanizing conditions"" during a raid on a school in Kaduna, a city approximately 150km north of Nigeria's capital, Abuja.

Chained and locked up

Mental health illness is so poorly understood that in some cases, people with these conditions are chained and locked up in unorthodox facilities across the country including traditional healing and religious centers.

According to a 2019 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), people in these facilities are subjected to different forms of abuse including force-feeding them medicine and herbs and whipping as part of their treatment.

A 22-year-old woman who suffered a mental health crisis after her mother's death told the human rights group that she had been held captive in a church for five months and denied food as part of a ""spiritual cleanse"" for her condition.

""I was tied with chains for three days straight so I could fast. For the three days, I had no food or water. It wasn't my choice, but the pastor said it was good for me. Sometimes if they say I should fast and I drink water or take food, they (the church staff) put me on a chain,"" she said in the report.

Similarly, an Islamic faith healer in northern Nigeria told HRW that he whips patients, leaving scars on their body, as a way to 'treat' them.

""If you are treating someone who is mentally unwell and he acts in a way that is causing a disturbance, you will have to treat him. Some of them might be talking to themselves or suffer from lack of sleep.... For some of them, getting enough sleep will help. For others, we need to whip them -- once, twice ... up to seven times,"" he said.

Dr. Nancy Orjinta, a resident psychiatrist at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital in Lagos, said keeping people with mental illness in such facilities can impact their health negatively and damage their self-esteem.

""I have seen patients who were chained for months battle with self-esteem issues. Keeping someone locked up will not only harm them physically, but they will start to feel low and dehumanized too,"" she said. She added that such conditions can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder caused by traumatic or distressing events.

Not enough psychiatrists

One of the reasons people visit religious and traditional healing centers for mental illness is a lack of understanding of mental health issues in the country, according to Dr. Orjinta.

Dr. Orjinta, told CNN that in many cases, Nigerians seek mental health care from unorthodox places, especially religious centers before considering going to the hospital

However, delaying mental care by not immediately going to hospital prolongs the time the patient stays without appropriate care and ""may create the worst outcome for the patient as they have more symptoms,"" she said.

""There is still a stigma around mental illness. People perceive it in a negative light and as a result they don't want to address it if they have symptoms. They want to keep on hiding it,"" she explained.

She also added there aren't enough mental health professionals in the country, making it difficult to access mental health care. For example, with a population of more than 200 million people, there are only 250 practicing psychiatrists in the country.

""There is a disproportionate sharing of mental health professionals, we don't really have them in rural areas. And if someone lives in such areas without mental health care, of course, they will find alternatives for care like traditional healers or churches,"" Dr. Orjinta explained.

Clampdown on rehabilitation centers

In recent times, authorities in Nigeria have rescued hundreds of people held under inhumane conditions in a clampdown on religious rehabilitation centers.

In September 2019, for example, police rescued more than 300 men and boys from an Islamic school in Kaduna, northern Nigeria. Some of them told the police they had been sexually abused and tortured by their teachers.

President Muhammadu Buhari also said in October of the same year that he would look into the activities of some Islamic rehabilitation centers , which have long been accused of abuse.

But mental health advocates say this is not enough.

Hauwa Ojeifo, a mental health activist and coach told CNN that Nigeria needs strong legislation that will set the standards for psychiatric treatment.

Data on mental health in the country is hard to come by, but an estimated 20-30% of the country's population is suffering from mental disorders, according to a 2016 report in the Annals of Nigerian Medicine Journal.

And in 2017, a World Health Organization report found that Nigerians have the highest incidences of depression in Africa , with more than 7 million people in the country suffering from depression.

Ojeifo who is also the founder of She Writes Woman , a non-profit focused on providing mental health support in the country said she wants a mental health bill that will encourage mental awareness in the country to be passed.

She described Nigeria's 1958 Lunacy Act , the current legislation governing mental health in the country as ""outdated"" and ""discriminatory.""

Under the act, people with mental health conditions are allowed to be detained, even without the provision of medical treatment.

""I don't just want any mental health bill to be passed. I am very particular about the content of the bill too. I want it to be respectful and accommodate the rights of persons with mental health conditions,"" she told CNN.

Mental health awareness

Mental health awareness is needed to combat the widespread use of religious and traditional healing centers for mental care, according to Dr. Orjinta.

""The media needs to come in to report mental health without framing it in a bad or scary way like some do. The same way you can say someone has a problem with his leg, you should be able to say someone has a brain problem. It should be like every other illness,"" she said.

She added that she is optimistic Nigeria will eventually get to a place where there is a minimal stigma regarding mental health. ""It won't be drastic and it will require many people like the government, media, and religious institutions putting in the effort, but I am optimistic.""

Godwin who was initially taken to church for prayers says care outside medical facilities should not be the first resort.

""There are drugs and medical facilities that can help with mental illness. I am not saying people who attribute it to spirituality are wrong, but I'd say there are other ways. Medicine is capable,"" he said.

He added that in his case, he wished he was taken to the hospital first for quicker diagnosis, before being subjected to religious healing."

30,2020-09-29 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/africa/blasphemy-trial-nigeria/index.html,The WhatsApp voice note that led to a death sentence,"(CNN) An intense argument recorded and posted in a WhatsApp group has led to a death penalty sentence and a family torn apart over allegations of insulting Prophet Mohammed, according to lawyers for the defendant.

Music studio assistant Yahaya Sharif-Aminu was sentenced to death by hanging on August 10 after being convicted of blasphemy by an Islamic court in northern Nigeria.

The judgment document states that Sharif-Aminu, 22, was convicted for making ""a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed in a WhatsApp Group,"" which is contrary to the Kano State Sharia Penal Code and is an offence which carries the death sentence.

The recording was shared widely, causing mass outrage in the highly conservative, majority Muslim, state, according to various reports.

""Whoever insults, defames or utters words or acts which are capable of bringing into disrespect ... such a person has committed a serious crime which is punishable by death,"" according to a translation of court documents provided to CNN by his lawyers.

Sharif-Aminu, described by his friend Kabiru Ibrahim, as ""kind, religious and dutiful,"" admitted charges of blasphemy during his trial, but said he had made a mistake.

No legal representation

Under Sharia law, a voluntary confession is binding, according to court papers.

Sharif-Aminu's lawyers, who became involved in the case only after his conviction, say he was not allowed legal representation before or during his trial -- in contravention of Nigerian citizens' constitutional right to legal representation.





According to the lawyers, the Sharia court adjourned his case four times because no lawyer came forth from the Legal Aid Council to represent him, likely because of the sensitivity of the case. The Sharia court is, however, statute-bound to provide legal representation.

Advocates from the Foundation for Religious Freedom (FRF), a not-for-profit aimed at protecting religious freedom in Nigeria, which is representing Sharif-Aminu, told CNN he has also not been permitted access to legal advice to prepare an appeal against his conviction.

The FRF says it has lodged an appeal on his behalf in Kano's high court, a common-law court with constitutional powers.

""The state laws he is accused of breaking are in gross conflict with the Nigerian constitution,"" said his counsel, Kola Alapinni.

No Muslim will condone it. People hold Prophet Mohammed higher than their parents. Islamic cleric, Bashir Aliyu Umar

Kano's State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje told clerics in Kano that he would sign Sharif-Aminu's death warrant as soon as the singer had exhausted the appeals process, local media reports say.

""I assure you that immediately the Supreme Court affirms the judgment, I will sign it without any hesitation,"" Ganduje said, according to Nigeria's Daily Post newspaper . CNN contacted a spokesman for Governor Ganduje several times for comment but did not receive a response.

Islamic scholar and cleric Bashir Aliyu Umar, who is not connected to the case, but said he had read the transcript of the court proceedings, told CNN, ""No Muslim will condone it. People hold Prophet Mohammed higher than their parents, and when things like this happen, it will lead to a breakdown of peace because of mob action and attacks against the accused.""

When news of Sharif-Aminu's alleged crime broke earlier this year, protesters marched to his family home and destroyed it, prompting his father to flee to a neighboring town, his lawyers told CNN. Sharif-Aminu went into hiding, according to Amnesty and his lawyers, but in March he was arrested by the Hisbah Corps, the religious police force that enforces Sharia law in Kano state.

'A travesty of justice'

Human rights organization Amnesty International has described Sharif-Aminu's trial as a ""travesty of justice,"" and called on Kano state authorities to quash his conviction and death sentence.

""There are serious concerns about the fairness of his trial and the framing of the charges against him based on his Whatsapp messages,"" said Amnesty's Nigeria director Osai Ojigho. ""Furthermore, the imposition of the death penalty following an unfair trial violates the right to life,"" she added.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has also condemned Sharif-Aminu's death sentence. It said Nigeria's blasphemy laws were inconsistent with universal human rights standards.

""It is unconscionable that Sharif-Aminu is facing a death sentence merely for expressing his beliefs artistically through music,"" said the organization's commissioner, Frederick A. Davie, in a statement.

The organization released a follow-up statement saying it had adopted Aminu-Sharif as ""a religious prisoner of conscience.""

Atheism frowned upon

Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and religion permeates every facet of life here, with prayers routinely said in schools and public offices. In addition to blasphemy, atheism is frowned upon by many in the majority Muslim north as well as in parts of the mostly Christian south.

Human rights groups have expressed concern over a crackdown on freedom of speech and expression, particularly when it comes to religion.

On April 28 this year, Mubarak Bala, president of the Nigerian humanist association, was arrested in Kaduna , another northern state, after allegedly posting a message on his Facebook page claiming that a Nigerian evangelical preacher was better than the Prophet Mohammed.

JUST WATCHED Iranian Instagram star 'arrested for blasphemy' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iranian Instagram star 'arrested for blasphemy' 00:44

His family and lawyers told Human Rights Watch they have not seen or heard from him since. Bala remains detained without charge and has not been allowed to communicate with his lawyers or his family, according to USCIRF.

Nigerian playwright and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka is among those who recently sent a message of solidarity to Bala, following his 100th day in confinement on August 6.

""As a child, I remember living in a state of harmonious coexistence all but forgotten in the Nigeria of today, as the plague of religious extremism has encroached,"" Soyinka, a former political prisoner, wrote , ""I write today to tell you that you are not alone, there is a whole community across the globe that stands beside you and will fight for you.""

Stoning, amputations, flogging

Sharia law has been practiced alongside secular law in many northern Nigerian states since they were reintroduced in 1999. Nigeria's Sharia courts can also sentence those convicted of offenses to stoning, amputations, and flogging; while the former two are no longer carried out, ""flogging is a quite common punishment for many crimes, particularly theft,"" according to the USCIRF.

Only one death sentence passed by Sharia courts has been carried out, according to Human Rights Watch . Sani Yakubu Rodi was hanged in 2002 for the murder of a woman, her four-year-old son, and baby daughter.

In 2015 and 2016 nine men and one woman were sentenced to death by hanging for insulting the Prophet Mohammed in Kano state, according to a 2019 research paper by the USCIRF . The sentences were not carried out.

In 2000, a Muslim man in the northern state of Zamfara had his hand amputated for stealing a cow. A year later, another man had his hand cut off after he was convicted of stealing bicycles, according to the same USCIRF research paper.

A constitutional violation?

In the eyes of many Nigerians, the adoption of Sharia law is a violation of the country's constitution , because Article 10 guarantees religious freedom when it states that ""the Government of the Federation or of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion.""

""This issue of blasphemy is incompatible with the Nigerian constitution,"" Leo Igwe, chair of the board of trustees for the Humanist Association of Nigeria, told CNN.

""We hope this case will help Nigeria confront the biggest constitutional challenge since independence. What should take precedence, Sharia law, or the Nigerian constitution?""

Governors of the northern states, where Sharia law is practiced, argue that it applies only to Muslims, and not to citizens of other faiths. The FRF says it is working on six other constitutional cases which will challenge what it sees as government interference in Nigerian citizens' right to religious freedom.

One of these, on behalf of the Atheist Society of Nigeria (ASN), is against the state government of Akwa Ibom, in the country's southeast, for its involvement in the construction of an 8,500-seat worship center at its High Court.

The ASN says millions of dollars in state funding have been spent on the center, which it says amounts to government interference in freedom of religion.

""The government has no business legislating on religions. End of story,"" Ebenezer Odubule, a founding member of the FRF told CNN.

The FRF says it has had to put some of its other cases on hold, to focus on Sharif-Aminu's case. It is also hampered by a lack of funding to fight new cases."

He was sentenced on August 10 by the same court that recently sentenced a studio assistant Yahaya Sharif-Aminu to death for blaspheming Prophet Mohammed, according to lawyers.

32,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/marketplace-africa-maasai-mara-safari-pivot-spc-intl/index.html,A massive animal migration is still happening in the Maasai Mara. But the pandemic means few can see it,"(CNN) — For Nadutari Tingisha, making beaded jewelry is the only job she's ever known. ""Beading is something we grew up doing, so we will never give up on it,"" she says.

She typically spends her days hawking her wares to tourists who flock to Kenya's Maasai Mara to take part in the region's world-renowned safaris. However, this year her clientele has been few and far between.

Every year between June and December, one of the world's largest and longest animal migrations takes place in East Africa. Over two million wildebeest, zebras, gazelles and other animals travel across the Serengeti into Kenya's Maasai Mara in pursuit of greener pastures.

Related content Incredible pictures of endangered rhinos in Kenya

Dubbed by many as the Great Migration, the circular route spans between 800 and 1,600 kilometers, with herds of wildebeest often seen stretching across 40 kilometers.

In the past, the bulk of Kenya's tourists arrived between June and October to witness the migration. However, months of travel restrictions due to the pandemic have dealt a blow to the country's tourism industry.

As the slowdown of international travel continues, Kenyan safari companies are facing unprecedented losses. CNN's Eleni Giokos takes a look at how safari operators in the Maasai Mara are looking to alternative streams of income amidst this period of financial uncertainty.

August is typically one of the busiest months for tourists, accounting for 10% of Kenya's total annual visitors, with around 250,000 travelers, according to Najib Balala, Kenya's Minister of Tourism and Wildlife. International flights were halted at the end of March due to coronavirus, and resumed on August 1; the country welcomed less than 15,000 tourists that month, Balala says. The drop in demand has put 2.5 million Kenyan tourism jobs in jeopardy.

Many of these belong to the Maasai themselves, a tribe known throughout the world for their traditions and colorful dress. The Maasai also own large swathes of the Maasai Mara -- often leasing the land to conservancies who run national game reserves and safaris.

In 2019, 15,000 Maasai landowners collected more than $7.5 million in lease payments, says Daniel Sopia, CEO of Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. This year, landowners say they're expecting to receive less than half that sum.

Charlette N'Guessan is the first woman to win the award , which could revolutionize cyber security and help curb identity fraud on the continent.

N'Guessan and her team won the £25,000 award (about $33,000) for BACE API, a digital verification system that uses Artificial Intelligence and facial recognition to verify the identities of Africans remotely and in real time.

BACE API works by matching the live photo of a user to the image on their documents such as passports or ID card, N'Guessan said.

For websites and online applications that have BACE API integrated in them, users will be verified via their webcam to establish their identity.

""For the person trying to submit their application, we ask them to switch on their camera to make sure the person behind the camera is real, and not a robot.

""We are able to capture the face of the person live and match their image with the one on the existing document the person submitted,"" she explained.

BACE API verifies users identities in real time using their phone camera or webcam



BACE API can be integrated into already existing applications and systems for identity verification and is targeted at mostly financial institutions on the continent, N'Guessan told CNN.

N'Guessan and her team won the Africa Prize for Innovation in a virtual award ceremony on September 3 where the Africa Prize judges and a live audience voted in their favor, the Royal Academy of Engineering said in a statement

""We are very proud to have Charlette N'Guessan and her team win this award,"" said Rebecca Enonchong, an entrepreneur from Cameroon entrepreneur and Africa Prize judge in the statement.

""It is essential to have technologies like facial recognition based on African communities, and we are confident their innovative technology will have far reaching benefits for the continent.""

BACE API matches a user's live photo with the image on their official documents to verify their identity.

Curbing identity fraud

N'Guessan, who is the CEO and co-founder of Ghana-based software company, BACE Group , told CNN that the idea came about while she was studying at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) in Accra, Ghana's capital city.

While there, she worked with a team of four and it was during one of their research projects in 2018 they decided to create BACE API, and later a software company.

""We ... talked to tech entrepreneurs. That's when we noticed that there is a huge problem with cyber security with online services and businesses,"" she said.

N'Guessan said their research found that many financial institutions in the west African country deal with identity fraud, estimating that they spend up to $400 million dollars yearly to identify their customers.

""We decided to make our contribution as software engineers and data scientists by building a solution that can be useful for this market,"" N'Guessan added.

Before the winner was announced on September 3, N'Guessan and other entrepreneurs shortlisted for the Africa Prize received eight months of training from experts across the world and her team was paired with an AI specialist who helped with improvements to their system.

An African woman in tech

N'Guessan's interest in technology started at a young age. Growing up in Ivory Coast, west Africa, she was encouraged to focus on science and technology subjects by her father, a mathematics professor.

""He inspired my choice for studying STEM. I was actually really good in science-related courses. After high school, I went on to study software engineering at university,"" she said.

Now running her own technology company, she told CNN that winning the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation has helped to boost her confidence as a CEO leading a technical team of men.

The Academy was founded in 1976 and has been running the award to reward engineering innovation in Africa since 2014.

Globally, the technology industry is growing, but women led startups are in short supply with only 22% founded by at least one woman, according to a report in Disrupt Africa.

Data specific to Africa is hard to come by but some studies suggest that only 9% of startups on the continent have women founders.

N'Guessan says she hopes that her achievement will motivate more women to consider careers in tech.

""I will be happy if people are inspired by my story, being the first woman to win the Africa Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation and by my work as a woman in tech,"" she said."
34,2020-09-25 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/09/25/africa/hauwa-ojeifo-mental-health-nigeria/index.html,She was diagnosed with a mental health disorder. Now she is helping others work through theirs,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) In February of 2016, Hauwa Ojeifo considered taking her own life. She had spent a significant part of her teenage and early adult life years battling symptoms such as mood swings, bouts of exhaustion, fainting spells and difficulty recollecting daily events.

She told CNN that growing up, there were days she could not get out of bed to carry out mundane activities like brushing her teeth.

At the time, she did not realize she was experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder , a mental health condition where a person's mood swings from high and overactive to low and dull.

""There were a lot of things leading to that moment where I thought about dying. I had an abusive relationship -- well, I can't call it a relationship now because I was like 14 or 15 at the time. But he used to punch me, beat me and gaslight me,"" Ojeifo explained.

She added that she was sexually abused in 2014 and did not know how to express being raped by a trusted partner to the people around her.

Her experiences, she said, piled up till she eventually snapped and started nursing suicidal notions.

""Trying to explain what was going on in my head was difficult. I looked fine physically, but it started to affect me mentally. I could go a day without being able to construct sentences, and I was a research analyst at the time which meant I had to write daily reports but I couldn't,"" she said.

After expressing her suicidal thoughts to a friend, she was encouraged to see a psychiatrist at a psychiatric hospital in Lagos, one of Nigeria's largest cities.

She was diagnosed with Bipolar and post traumatic stress disorder with mild psychosis. ""I poured out my heart, got some tests done and eventually got a diagnosis.""

Creating awareness

Two months after Ojeifo's diagnosis, she said she decided to turn her difficult experiences around. She started to create awareness on the far-reaching impacts of mental health in Nigeria.

In April 2016, she created She Writes Woman , a non-profit organization focused on providing mental health support for those who may need it in the west African nation.

There is minimal mental health awareness and there are not enough mental health professionals in Nigeria.

Ojeifo told CNN that She Writes Woman started as a blog but she realized she could do more with it, ""At first, I was just using it as an outlet to share my experiences and that of other women,"" she explained.

Eventually, it morphed into a support community for people with mental health conditions.

The 28-year-old got trained as a mental health coach so that she could start a helpline to talk to people experiencing overwhelming mental health symptoms.

""From sharing stories on the blog and social media, She Writes Woman blew up into a helpline which was run by me for a while, and then to a support group for people in vulnerable conditions,"" she said.

24-hour mental health helpline

She Writes Woman provides a 24-hour mental health helpline for anyone within Nigeria.

The helpline serves as a first point of contact for people in distress or those who just want to talk about their mental health and symptoms.

""People call the helpline to get what we call a first-aid treatment. On the call you don't get immediate professional counseling, what happens is you get a first response communication where someone listens to you and what you have to say,"" Ojeifo explained.

She added that after the first responders, callers can be referred to mental health professionals for therapy or a diagnosis if needed, ""depending on what the issue is we que people in to either a therapist or a psychiatrist.""

Data on mental health in Nigeria is hard to find, but according to a 2016 report in the Annals of Nigerian Medicine journal, an estimated 20-30% of the country's population is suffering from mental disorders.

And in 2017, a World Health Organization report found that Nigerians have the highest incidences of depression in Africa, with more than 7 million people in the country suffering from depression.

Despite the numbers, there is an absence of effective mental health legislation setting standards for psychiatric treatment or encouraging mental health awareness in the country.

In February, following deliberations by legislators to pass a proposed mental health bill, Ojeifo became the first person to testify before the Nigerian parliament on the rights of persons with mental health conditions in the country.

The bill has yet to be implemented.

To close the mental health gap in Nigeria, Ojeifo's organization also offers a support group for women and girls called Safe Place in six Nigerian states.

""Safe Space provides a community of shared experiences for women and girls. It provides a space for women to connect and share their experiences on whatever topic, to be there for one another and understand that they are not alone in their journeys,"" she explained, estimating that there have been over 50 meetings of the support group since the inception of the organization.

In the beginning, Ojeifo, a former investment banker, self-funded the organization.

But now, with donations and grants from organizations such as One Young World, Airtel Nigeria and Disability Rights Advocacy Fund, it is able to expand and carry out more activities in Nigeria's mental health space.

In 2018, the activist received a Queen's Young Leaders Award in in recognition of her work with the 24-hour mental health helpline and Safe Space support group.

Changemaker Award Winner

On Tuesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation named Ojeifo as its Changemaker Award winner for 2020 for her work with She Writes Woman.

The Changemaker Award is one of the Goalkeepers Global Goals Awards pushed yearly by the foundation. It celebrates individuals who have inspired change from a position of leadership or using their personal experience.

In a statement released Tuesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said it recognized the activist for her work in promoting Gender Equality , the fifth global goal for sustainable development prescribed by the United Nations.

Ojeifo said that she was in ""disbelief"" when she first received the email alerting her that she was a recipient of the award.

""It was so unexpected and it came as a surprise because I was not expecting it. It's like an added validation to the work She Writes Woman does,"" she said.

""During one of the meetings with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation I asked them how I was selected because I was just so blown away. I was told that it was because I had used my personal experience to build hope for people and to drive change,"" she added.

Through the 2020 Changemaker Award, Ojeifo is hoping to gather a network that will help amplify the work She Writes Woman does even more.

""The Changemaker award means I am part of this network that is dedicated to amplifying my cause and giving me visibility,"" she said."
35,2020-07-12 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/12/us/ray-hushpuppi-alleged-money-laundering-trnd/index.html,He flaunted private jets and luxury cars on Instagram. Feds used his posts to link him to alleged cyber crimes,"To his 2.5 million Instagram followers, he went by Ray Hushpuppi, a man who boarded helicopters from his Dubai waterfront apartment and walked around with shopping bags from Gucci, Versace and Fendi.

On social media, where he posted a video of himself tossing wads of cash like confetti, he told his followers he was a real estate developer. But a federal affidavit alleged his extravagant lifestyle was financed through hacking schemes that stole millions of dollars from major companies in the United States and Europe.

His flamboyant posts left a digital trail of evidence that investigators used to link him to the crimes, the affidavit shows.

Last month, United Arab Emirates investigators swooped into his Dubai apartment, arrested him and handed him over to FBI agents, who flew him to Chicago on July 2, federal officials said.

In the coming weeks, he'll be transferred to Los Angeles -- where the affidavit was filed -- to face accusations of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cyber crime schemes.

Ramon Abbas allegedly conspired to launder millions of dollars.

$41 million and 13 luxury cars seized

The Nigerian national lived at the exclusive Palazzo Versace in Dubai, and led a global network that used computer intrusions, business email compromise schemes and money laundering to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from companies, federal prosecutors allege.

He worked with multiple co-conspirators and was arrested along with 11 others. Investigators seized nearly $41 million, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8 million, and phone and computer evidence, Dubai Police said in a statement. They uncovered email addresses of nearly 2 million possible victims on phones, computers and hard drives, Dubai authorities said.

""This case targets a key player in a large, transnational conspiracy who was living an opulent lifestyle in another country while allegedly providing safe havens for stolen money around the world,"" US Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement.

Abbas' attorney, Gal Pissetzky, declined to get into details on how his client earns his money. But what he does for a living is going to be ""one of the main points of contention here,"" he told CNN.

Pissetzky called his client's arrest a kidnapping, saying Dubai handed him to the United States with ""no legal proceedings whatsoever."" Abbas has not been formally indicted, and the government has 30 days to indict him, his attorney said Thursday.

His birthday post helped track him down

Abbas made no secret of his opulent lifestyle and remarkable wealth. On Snapchat, he called himself the ""Billionaire Gucci Master.""

""Started out my day having sushi down at Nobu in Monte Carlo, Monaco, then decided to book a helicopter to have ... facials at the Christian Dior spa in Paris then ended my day having champagne in Gucci,"" he posted on Instagram

Photos of him displaying multiple models of Bentley, Ferrari, Mercedes and Rolls Royce cars included the hashtag #AllMine. Others show him rubbing elbows with international sports stars and other celebrities.

In the affidavit, federal officials detailed how his social media accounts provided a treasure trove of information to confirm his identity. His Instagram, for example, had an email and phone number saved for account security purposes. Federal officials got that information and linked that email and phone number to financial transactions and transfers with people the FBI believed were his co-conspirators.

""The email account ... also contained emails with attachments relating to wire transfers in large dollar values,"" the affidavit said.

His Apple and Snapchat records also provided information that helped investigators confirm his identity, address and communications with other suspects. Even his Instagram birthday celebration photos provided key information.

One post displayed a birthday cake topped with a Fendi logo and a miniature image of him surrounded by tiny shopping bags. Investigators used that post to verify his date of birth on a previous US visa application.

Ramon Abbas told his 2.5 million Instagram followers that he's in real estate.

Companies targeted spanned two continents

His alleged cyber crimes involved jaw-dropping amounts of money.

Federal documents detailed how a paralegal at a New York law firm wired nearly $923,000 meant for a client's real estate refinancing to a bank account controlled by Abbas and his co-conspirators. The paralegal had received fraudulent wire instructions after sending an email to what appeared to be a bank email address but was later identified as a ""spoofed"" email address, the affidavit said.

Abbas sent a co-conspirator an image of the wire transfer confirmation for the transaction, according to the affidavit. He and an unnamed person also conspired to launder $14.7 million from a foreign financial institution last year, according to a criminal complaint.

During that alleged cyber crime, Abbas sent a co-conspirator the account information for a Romanian bank account, which he said could be used for ""large amounts."" In other alleged schemes, he also provided Dubai bank accounts that can be used to deposit money from victims in the United States, the affidavit said.

He's also accused of conspiring to try to steal $124 million from an unnamed English Premier League soccer club. But it's unclear whether the attempt was successful.

FBI recorded $1.7 billion in losses from such scams

Business email compromise schemes are sophisticated scams that involve a hacker redirecting business email account communications to try and intercept wire transfers.

""BEC schemes are one of the most difficult cyber crimes we encounter as they typically involve a coordinated group of con artists scattered around the world who have experience with computer hacking and exploiting the international financial system,"" Hanna said.

Last year alone, the FBI recorded $1.7 billion in losses by companies and individuals victimized through business email compromise scams, according to Paul Delacourt of the FBI field office in Los Angeles.

If convicted of money laundering, Abbas faces up to 20 years in prison. His bond hearing is set for Monday.

His transfer to Los Angeles has been complicated by logistics linked to coronavirus, his attorney said."
36,2020-08-26 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/africa/gambia-migration-intl/index.html,He almost died migrating to Europe. Now he is warning other Gambians about it,"He had hoped to be in Europe by now, pursuing his dreams of studying computer science and making a better life for himself.

Instead, he was sitting in a Libyan detention center, having been detained in Tripoli by the Libyan Coast Guard.

""We were kept in rooms with little ventilation and no toilets. We would sit for days without taking baths. It was like hell,"" Sallah told CNN.

He added that officers at the detention center often assaulted them by ""beating us for the slightest things like refusing to sleep.""

It was January 2017, and the 25-year-old Gambian had taken a gamble, risking his life in search of a better one in Europe. But no one had warned him of the dangers ahead.

If and when he got out of the detention center, he vowed to help others make a more informed decision.

Migrating to Europe

Sallah grew up in Serekunda, southwest of The Gambia's capital city, Banjul. He said he worked hard in school to earn a scholarship so that his mother could retire from her job selling vegetables in the market.

In 2016, he thought he'd have that chance when he earned a scholarship to study computer science in Taiwan. ""But there was no Taiwan embassy in Gambia, so I had to go to the closest one in Abuja, Nigeria,"" he explained.

After borrowing money from his sister to travel to Nigeria, he said he spent three months there before his visa application was denied. Three years earlier, then-president of The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, had cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan for what he called ""national strategic interest.""

""I didn't know what to do: stay in Nigeria, or go to any other African country. At the end of the day, I got the mind of migrating (to Europe) because I know several people who took the journey and made it there,"" Sallah explained.

With a population of 2.3 million people , The Gambia is among the smallest countries in Africa. But despite its small size, migration is a fairly common practice and plays a key role in the country's economy.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), overseas remittances for an average of 90,000 Gambians who live abroad make up more than 20% of the country's GDP

48% of Gambians live in poverty, and many people find themselves looking outside the country for opportunities to improve their lives.

But some people leave the country without proper documentation or without crossing an official border point. Between 2014 and 2018, the IOM estimates more than 35,000 Gambians reached Europe through ""irregular means.""

""There's a tradition of mobility in Gambia. It's a long history of people using migration as a means of life, and of getting their income. Many of the returnees we have worked with claim they took the journey for economic reasons,"" Etienne Micallef, the IOM's program manager in The Gambia told CNN.

""They have the perception that if they migrate with the final destination as Europe, they will get a much better income to sustain themselves and their families back home,"" he added.

But it comes at a high risk. Globally, at least 33,687 migrant deaths and disappearances were recorded between January 2014 and October 2019, according to IOM -- with nearly half occurring on the route between Northern Africa and Italy.

Sallah, who said he wanted an education that would allow him to find a job to support his family, reiterated that no one warned him how incredibly dangerous the journey would be.

After his visa to study in Taiwan was rejected, he said he got on a bus heading north to Agadez, a city in Niger. ""I didn't even know the area -- I just kept asking people around what the best or possible way to reach Niger was.""

From there, he managed to travel to Libya. ""You have to pay smugglers who drive pickup trucks to put you at the back of their trucks to get to Libya and then to Europe. I spent a month with my cousin in Libya before heading in another pickup truck for Tripoli,"" he told CNN.

His journey to Tripoli was treacherous, he said, telling CNN he was detained and extorted multiple times by armed bandits.

Sallah said he was close to death from starvation and even witnessed a gun battle between armed bandits and smugglers: ""The man that was smuggling us told us that if we want to stay in Tripoli, we must get used to gunshots,"" he said.

But it all came to an abrupt halt in January 2017, when he was arrested by the Libyan Coast Guard in Tripoli.

Detention Center

Libya is a primary transit point along the central Mediterranean route. People who get stuck there are often detained by the Libyan Coast Guard, responsible for patrolling coastal waters to prevent smuggling and trafficking.

Sallah said he was kept in a detention center in Tripoli with migrants from different West African countries for nearly four months under poor conditions.

There are 11 detention centers for migrants run by the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya. Some 2,362 detainees are held at these facilities on any given day, according to the Global Detention Project.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International have criticized the conditions at these detention centers; both groups signed onto a statement released in April that urged EU member states and institutions to review their policy on migrants and cooperation with Libya.

While in detention, Sallah met a fellow Gambian who suggested they set up the non-profit organization Youth Against Irregular Migration (YAIM) to warn others back home about the risks of irregular migration.

""I went around the detention center gathering details of all the Gambians I could find,"" estimating he registered 171 people to join the organization. ""We agreed that if we made it out of there, we would start an association to make people aware of how problematic the journey to Europe is,"" he said.

Youth Against Irregular Migration

In April 2017, as part of its mandate to return and reintegrate migrants stranded or detained in their transit countries, IOM facilitated the return of Sallah and many others within the detention center back to The Gambia.

That same year, IOM received funding from the EU worth 3.9 million euros (about $4.6 million) over the course of three years, to expand its operations in The Gambia.

Since then, according to Micallef, IOM has repatriated more than 5,000 people to the West African nation.

He added that when returnees arrive at the airport or land border, they are met by IOM staff who arrange for temporary shelter, counseling, and medical support for those who need it.

Weeks after returning to The Gambia, Sallah said he met with some members of YAIM who signed up in the detention center.

""We met almost every week after arriving in Gambia,"" he explained. ""It was difficult for us financially at the start but many of us had the support of our families.""

YAIM members speak to community members about the dangers of irregular migration.

He added that even though many of them struggled to make a living at the start and had to pick up menial jobs around town to survive, being around other members gave them a renewed sense of hope.

Being safe at home, he said, was a better option than the dangerous journey to Europe.

""We bonded by sharing our stories with each other as a way to work through the trauma,"" Sallah said. ""We made sure to be there for each other.""

Community awareness

Through YAIM, the returnees began campaigns around irregular migration in The Gambia, warning others about the perils of journeying to Europe.

Tombong Kuyateh, a returnee and YAIM member, told CNN that the association visits schools to share experiences with students who may be thinking about migrating.

""We share our personal stories with them. We show them examples of victims who were injured or affected during the journey to prevent them from experiencing the same,"" he said.

The 27-year-old added that a lot of people listen to them because they have first-hand experience of what it's like to attempt that trip.

Members of YAIM take to the streets of Banjul, The Gambia, during one of their public campaigns.

By crowdfunding and partnering with local and international groups for support, YAIM is also able to visit small communities across the country for campaigns against irregular migration, Kuyateh said.

Miko Alazas, the IOM communications officer based in The Gambia, told CNN that the organization sometimes partners with returnee associations like YAIM to get people access to the right information, in order to make better migration-related choices.

""We work a lot with returnees because many of them are passionate about sharing their experiences in terms of exploitation and abuse -- so they are at the forefront of a lot of campaigns to raise awareness on irregular migration,"" he said.

Now 29, Sallah travels around his home country, visiting radio stations and communities to talk about his harrowing experience. He believes in the power of storytelling to educate others about migration.

""I always tell them about the difficulties,"" he said. ""Some people lost their lives on the journey. I was part of those who ended up in detention. Every time you are on that journey, you are close to death."""
37,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/bubu-ogisi-iamisigo-wcs/index.html,The designer choosing pan-African pride over Western attention,"Written by Binwe Adebayo, CNN

Bubu Ogisi is making African fashion in Africa for Africans. The Nigerian creative director, stylist and the designer behind the label IAMISIGO, Ogisi is committed to celebrating African philosophies, fabrics and techniques. She and her close-knit teams of artisans have created a label which breaks many of the ""rules"" about what African brands are and should be.

Not interested in capturing Western audiences or selling big, IAMISIGO's work is focused on using fashion to tell the colorful and complicated story of Africa's history, present and future.

""In 100 years, what will our descendants reference about us?"" Ogisi said over the phone. ""Are they going to be referencing Western pieces that we tried to Africanize, or this new age of African design that was able to bring the continent together? That's my long-term goal.""

And it's a goal she has been working towards for quite some time. After leaving Nigeria to study computer science in Ghana, Ogisi began to become aware of the complexity of West African style. Noticing the difference in aesthetics, body shapes, fabrics and styling between Ghana and her home country, Ogisi realised that she could use her lifelong interest in clothing to showcase the diversity of Africa.

Not one to rest on intuition and talent alone, Ogisi studied fashion at the Ecole Supérieure des Arts et Technique de la Mode (ESMOD) in Paris. Having mastered the technical elements of fashion, IAMISIGO was born in 2009. The label's name combines the words ""I AM"" with Ogisi's surname stylized in the reverse -- a nod to the fact that the label is Ogisi's stamp on the world.

She has since showcased collections at Paris and London fashion weeks, been featured in British Vogue and had one of her garments handpicked by supermodel Naomi Campbell. But the mission has not shifted. Despite an increase in international interest, Ogisi is clear about what she is (and isn't trying) to do with the brand.

""I've had offers from China and Italy and all over; people who want to buy my designs and mass produce them. I'm not interested in that,"" she said. ""I spend time with old men in villages who pass on their weaving craft to their grandchildren, because that is the only way the skills will survive"".

This dedication to locally focused craftsmanship and materials shows itself in each of her garments. Operating between studios in Lagos, Accra and Nairobi, regular road trips to source materials and learn new skills are crucial to Ogisi's creative process. Her most recent collection, Chasing Evil, makes use of palm leaf from the Congo, which she transported cross-continent in bags filled with sand to preserve the delicate material. She says that some of the garments require an intricate weaving process, which she said can take up to a full day to complete.

For Chasing Evil, Ogisi enlisted Kenyan master jeweler Brian Kivuti to create once-off pieces to accompany her apparel. Where appropriate the designs make use of secondhand fabrics and accessories, where making or buying a new item would have meant unnecessary waste. The collection also makes use of Ugandan unbleached cotton as a staple material. The name of collection was chosen to reflect this return to African pride,

""The only way to chase evil is through unity across borders and truly believing in the works of our hands,"" Ogisi said.

While her pro-Africa outlook is by no means novel in the world of fashion, the commitment to applying it to all elements of the label is part of a shift in approach taken by African designers. Like the LVMH Prize 2019 winner, South African Thebe Magugu, who continues to operate from his inner-city Johannesburg studio, Ogisi recognizes that being accepted by the Western fashion world does not necessarily mean that she should take her sights off the many markets across the continent.

""I want to see my clothes on women in Nairobi, Cape Town, Lagos, Accra,"" she said. ""I want these women to feel that somebody understood their history and their bodies and the lives they lead. Every piece is a love letter to them, and to my continent.""

IAMISIGO represents the hope of a self-affirming, self-sufficient Africa. While fashion is often dismissed as frivolous, or separate from ""real issues,"" Ogisi proves that politics is everywhere: in the products we consume, in the people with whom we work and even the clothes we wear."

Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered another large cache of unopened sarcophagi in Saqqara, adding to the trove of almost 60 coffins recently recovered from the ancient necropolis.

Although full details are yet to be announced, authorities said in a statement that ""a huge number"" of wooden sarcophagi had been unearthed. The country's Tourism and Antiquities Minister Khaled El-Enany said on Instagram that the find amounted to ""dozens"" of coffins, adding that they have been ""sealed since ancient times.""

The collection of sarcophagi, stored in three newly discovered burial shafts, is believed to date back more than 2,500 years. Colored and gilded statues were also found in the tombs, a government press release said.

On Monday, El-Enany and Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly visited the site alongside secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mustafa Waziri. Photos released by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities show the trio being lowered into a shaft before inspecting painted coffins and a variety of other objects.

Monday's announcement marks the latest in a string of discoveries at Saqqara, a necropolis about 20 miles south of Cairo. The vast burial ground once served the royal capital of Memphis, and the site is also home to Egypt's oldest surviving pyramid

In September, archaeologists at Saqqara discovered almost 30 closed coffins in one of three burial shafts measuring 10 to 12 meters (33 to 39 feet) deep. At a press conference earlier this month, the ministry said the discovery brought the total number found inside the tombs to 59.

Officials said they believe the coffins contain senior statesmen and priests from the 26th dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 664 B.C. to 525 B.C.

The ministry said that further details of this month's discovery will be announced at a press conference at the site in ""the next few weeks."" Its announcement also revealed that Prime Minister Madbouly had produced a video in which he thanked the ministry and ""expressed his great pride in the unique Egyptian civilization.""

Egypt's new one-billion dollar museum

Although it is not yet confirmed what will happen to the newly discovered sarcophagi, some of those found earlier this year are set to go on display at the soon-to-open Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza. Upon its opening, the 5.2-million-square-foot structure will become the world's largest museum devoted to a single civilization."
40,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/my-octopus-teacher-craig-foster/index.html,The incredible tale of a man who formed an unlikely bond with an octopus,"(CNN) — Craig Foster was diving, bare-chested, in bitterly cold waters off the southern-most tip of Africa when he saw her -- an octopus hiding under a cloak of shells and stones.

Enchanted, he began following this incredibly shy creature, trying to prove he wasn't a predator by staying very still in her presence. For weeks she evaded him: hiding in her den, camouflaging herself, or pushing her liquid body into the nearest crack to escape.

And then, after 26 days of near obsessive wooing, she reached out and touched him.

In the new Netflix documentary ""My Octopus Teacher"" this tender moment moves you in a way you never thought an octopus tentacle wrapped around a human hand could.

Filmed in 2010, ""My Octopus Teacher"" chronicles the year Craig Foster spent cultivating a unique bond with an extraordinary creature. The nature documentary has received eight nominations for the Jackson Wild Media Award and won Best Feature at the EarthxFilm Festival

Foster was able to capture intimate moments of this octopus' short life by spending up to two hours following her every single day for a year.



""If you gain the trust of that animal over a period of months, it will actually ignore you to a certain degree and carry on with its normal life, and allow you to step inside its secret world,"" Foster tells CNN.

We see her outwitting a shark by hitching a ride on its back, growing a new tentacle after surviving a shark attack, and finally wasting away after laying a clutch of eggs.

""The octopus showed me many behaviors that were completely new to science, because this animal trusted me,"" he says

The most powerful moment for Foster was when she allowed him to follow her on a hunt.



""It's not like you are in a Jeep and arrive upon a hunting scene on land,"" he explains. ""In the water it's intimate. When she chooses to let you into her world ... it's a very, very special moment of not just being accepted, but that your presence to her also feels natural, like you belong in that space with her.""

Foster has spent the last ten years diving in a kelp forest in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of South Africa where water temperatures can drop as low as 8 degrees Celsius.

Known as the ""Cape of Storms,"" he describes this patch of ocean as ""the most treacherous coast in the world."" While some swimmers fear sharks or other predators, Foster says the greatest threat to his life is being thrown onto a rock by a big wave.

The healing power of the ocean

Foster began this daily diving regimen as a way of dealing with a depression that had left him raw and disconnected. ""I was struggling. My only way to heal felt like I needed to be in the ocean, my go-to happy place as a child.""

Immersing himself in this underwater world has calmed his mind, he says. Over the years other animals have reached out to make contact, including otters, whales, cuttlefish and even sharks. ""They have chosen to come to me and make that contact, showing a moment of trust and vulnerability,"" he says. ""Every time it's breathtaking and healing.""

But nothing has compared to his ""once-in-a-lifetime"" bond with the octopus, he says.

Foster says the greatest lesson she taught him is that humans are part of the natural world around us, and not simply visitors."
41,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/akon-city-senegal-wakanda-intl/index.html,R&B singer Akon is building a 'real-life Wakanda' worth $6 billion in Senegal,"(CNN) — The award-winning R&B singer Akon is going ahead with ambitious plans to build a ""futuristic"" city in Senegal that he says will be a real-life version of Wakanda, the hi-tech nation portrayed in Marvel blockbuster ""Black Panther.""

On Monday, Akon, real name Aliaume Damala Badara Akon Thiam, laid the first stone for Akon city in Mbodiene park, 100 kilometers from Dakar, the country's capital city, and said work would begin next year.

""We are looking at Akon city to become the beginning of Africa's future,"" he said at the ceremony also attended by Alioune Sarr, Senegal's minister for tourism, and other government officials. ""Our idea is to build a futuristic city that incorporates all the latest technologies, cryptocurrencies, and also the future of how African society should become in the future.""

According to its official website, the solar-powered city will have healthcare facilities, offices, luxury houses, shopping malls, skyscrapers, and eco-friendly tourist centers. It will be a five-minute drive from the country's new international airport.

The singer was gifted 2,000 acres of land by Senegalese President Macky Sall to build the ambitious city. Akon also said he has raised part of the $6 billion required to do so through unnamed investors.

He first announced his idea for the idealistic city back in 2018 where compared it to the fictional technologically advanced nation of Wakanda portrayed in ""Black Panther.""

Cryptocurrency

The plan is for Akon city to trade exclusively in its own digital cash currency (cryptocurrency) called Akoin

Unlike other cryptocurrencies tied to stable currencies, Akoin is tied to cellphone minutes and relies on the use of smartphones.

According to the singer, more people in Africa trust their cellphone companies more than they trust local currency.

In November 2019, the singer told CNN that cryptocurrency will allow Africans to become less dependent on their governments . He argued that Akoin will enable people to have control of their own currency and by extension make financial decisions without external interference from their countries.

""We want to be able to kill corruption through blockchain itself and I think starting with currency, it is the biggest thing. The main thing they (Africans) will be able to gain is independence and I think being in the position to make your own financial decisions is key,"" he said.

Yet Akoin has faced criticism and questions around how it works in low income countries with little access to smartphones or data.

Only one-third of Senegal's 16.2 million population have access to a smartphone, according to a 2018 report by the Pew Research Center.

Job creation

Akon told a press conference that work would begin on his city in 2021. Seyllou/AFP/Getty Images

The singer -- who spent his early childhood in Senegal before leaving for New Jersey at the age of seven, according to his website -- said Akon city would create job opportunities for Senegalese people and serve as an alternative destination African Americans facing discrimination in the United States

""I wanted to build a city or a project like this that would give them (African Americans) the motivation to know that there is a home back home... The system back home (in the US) treats them unfairly in so many different ways that you can never imagine and they only go through it because they feel like there is no other way,"" he explained.

He added that his hope is for Senegal to be the go-to tourist destination in Africa as a result of Akon city.

""As you are coming from America or Europe, anywhere in the diaspora and you feel that you want to visit Africa, we want Senegal to be your first stop,"" he says.

Alioune Sarr, the Senegalese tourism minister, cheered Akon's decision to invest in the country at this time when the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the nation's economy.

""At a time, in a context where national and international private investment is rare. Akon, you have chosen to come to Senegal and invest $6 billion in the coming years,"" Sarr said.

Africa's tourism industry was hit hard by the pandemic as airports, hotels, restaurants, event centers and tour companies across the continent shut down as a way to curb the spread of the virus.

This is not Akon's first major investment on the continent. Over the past years, the entertainer has signed off on major deals in Africa.

In 2014, for example, he started Akon Lighting Africa, a charity project in partnership with the World Bank and governments to provide solar-powered electricity for 600 million Africans."

""I arrive at 9am, all geared (up) for this invisible enemy,"" she says. The 45-year-old designer and founder of Nigerian fashion label Tiffany Amber now starts each day with a 10-minute safety talk for her production team, ""who at first did not seem to understand the gravity and the potential of being infected by the (Covid-19) virus.""

Coker founded Tiffany Amber in 1998, and it's now considered one of Nigeria's most influential fashion and lifestyle brands.

In early March, the number of colorful prints and couture runway garments that normally littered the factory floor dissipated, and the company's sewing machines began stitching hospital scrubs, gowns, stretcher sheets and non-medical face masks. Less than a month after the pandemic reached Africa, Tiffany Amber's entire factory refocused to produce personal protective equipment (PPE), something Coker notes took immense pressure to turn around.

The colorful garments of the Tiffany Amber fashion line, seen here during Arise Fashion week in 2019, have since been replaced in production by PPE to help during the pandemic.

To make the shift, Coker says the company first had to secure more than 15 tons of raw materials including approximately 90,000 yards of fabric, 300,000 yards of elastic, and almost a million yards of thread. All of this happened, she says, right before borders closed in Nigeria and prices spiked due to the unforeseen demand for materials."
43,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/congo-style-sapeurs-sapeuses-africa-avant-garde/index.html,How a world-famous Congolese style tradition is changing with the times,"Written by Tariq Zaidi

Often referred to as ""dandies"" of the Congo, ""sapeurs"" and ""sapeuses"" are men, women and children whose sharp and stylish way of dressing has caught the world's attention. Below, photographer Tariq Zaidi writes about his own experiences immortalizing some of the followers of ""La Sape,"" describing how the tradition first started and how it has evolved with the times in an edited excerpt from the book "" Sapeurs: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Congo ."" All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.

Between 2017 and 2019, I traveled to Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to meet whole families of sapeurs, including female ""sapeuses"" and mini ""sapes"" in training.

My aim was to highlight the important role ""La Sape"" plays in their defiance of circumstance, through the stark contrast of the elegance of their dress against the harsh backdrop of their surroundings. The Congo is one of the poorest regions of the world and so, at first glance, followers of the ""Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes"" (the Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant People) -- La Sape -- are an extraordinary sight.

Congolese people are known for taking pride in their appearance, yet La Sape takes the art of looking good to the next level. Papa Wemba, the famously dapper Congolese rumba singer credited with popularizing the sapeur look, said his inspiration came from his parents, who in the 1960s were ""always well put together, always looking very smart.""

Sapeur families are treated like celebrities. They bring hope and joie de vivre to communities that have been ravaged by years of violence and conflict. Spending money on ornate pipes and silk socks might seem frivolous in a country like the DRC, where more than 70% of the population live in poverty, but La Sape aims to do more than help people forget their troubles. It has become a subtle form of social activism -- a way of turning the tables on power and rebelling against the economic conditions they live in.

Maxime Pivot Mabanza, 43-year-old teacher of La Sape and sapeur for 36 years, in Brazzaville, 2017, captured by Tariq Zaidi Credit: Tariq Zaidi

The movement can be traced back to the Congolese resicstance of the 1920s, when young men sought to adopt and imitate French and Belgian clothes as a way of combating colonial superiority. Congolese houseboys spurned their masters' second-hand clothes and became defiant consumers, spending their meager monthly wages to acquire the latest extravagant fashions from Paris.

After independence in 1960, both Kinshasa and Brazzaville became centers for a new francophone African elite. Many Congolese traveled to Paris and London and returned with designer clothes. As Papa Wemba put it, ""white people invented the clothes, but we (Africans) make an art of it.""

Despite campaigns in the 1980s to ban sapeurs from public spaces, Le Sape culture has seen a resurgence in recent years. Sapeurs of all ages still gather to dance, talk and have friendly fashion face-offs to compete for recognition as the best-dressed sapeur. And they are treated with respect -- they are seen as a vital and life-affirming part of Congolese cultural heritage.

In countries torn apart by colonialism, corruption, civil war and poverty, sapeurs have found that shared sartorial ambitions -- and their gentlemanly, civil code of conduct -- can help to heal the infighting. ""I don't see how anyone in La Sape could be violent or fight. Peace means a lot to us,"" said Severin, a 62-year-old whose father was also a sapeur.

True Sapologie is about more than expensive labels: the true art lies in a sapeur's ability to put together an elegant look unique to their personality.

Though the tradition is usually passed down through the male line, many Congolese women have recently begun donning designer suits and becoming sapeuses. By challenging Congolese patriarchal society in this way, they are returning to La Sape's origins by reversing the power dynamic.

La Sape is a movement that is constantly evolving, as disenfranchised youths use fashion as a way of navigating their nations' journeys from developing countries into a more hopeful cosmopolitan future."
44,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/kenya-things-to-do/index.html,20 best things to do in Kenya,"(CNN) — Folks who have never been there tend to think of Kenya as a one-trick pony -- an awesome safari destination and little more.

But East Africa's No. 1 travel destination (nearly 1.5 million international visitors in 2017) is actually a multifaceted place with a wide variety of adventures both rural and urban.

While wildlife remains the lodestone, Kenya also offers awesome Indian Ocean beaches , world-class mountain trekking, surprisingly good nightlife, an eclectic cultural heritage and interesting ways to get around (from ancient sailing craft to a spanking brand new railway line).

Check out our list of 20 of the best things to do in Kenya:

1. Summit Mount Kenya

High-altitude hotspot: Mt. Kenya Kenya Tourism Board

Rising to just over 17,000 feet (3,800 meters), Mount Kenya is the continent's second highest peak. But the summit trails are far less crowded than its snowy counterpart (Kilimanjaro) across the border in Tanzania.

You'll likely have the mountain all to your own during a trek that normally spans five days from start to finish (with four overnights on the mountain). True to its name, Mount Kenya Safaris offers guided trips via any of the three main routes to the top.

2. Watch the Great Migration in Masai Mara

On the move: The Great Migration Kenya Tourism Board

Arriving from the neighboring Serengeti Plains, millions of wildebeest, antelope and zebra -- and the predators that follow them -- thunder through Masai Mara National Reserve between July and October during the Great Migration.

The spectacle can be viewed on game drives, airplane or hot-air balloon flights, walking or horseback safaris.

3. Soak up sea, sun & sand at Diani

Dubbed the ""Lunatic Express"" when it first opened in 1901 -- because it seemed like such a crazy idea to build a railroad through the African bush -- the legendary line was totally modernized in 2017 with completion of a US$2.3-billion dollar upgrade of both the tracks and passengers trains.

The Madaraka Express makes the journey in 4.5 hours with daily 9 a.m. departures from both Nairobi and Mombasa.

45,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/kenyan-food-dishes/index.html,Kenya's best food is a kaleidoscope of flavors,"(CNN) — ""Food tastes much better when you eat it with your hands,"" declares Nairobi-based food blogger Kaluhi Adagala , using her fingers to tease some freshly baked tilapia off the bone. ""It's like a hands-on, intimate relationship between you and the food.""

Adagala is in the dining room of the Delta Plaza branch of contemporary Kenyan restaurant Nyama Mama -- bold with African wax prints -- with a colorful feast of fish, meat, samosas, cornmeal and greens prepared by executive chef Lesiamon Sempele.

Nairobi is the vibrant, chaotic heart of Kenya . It's a fast-evolving city in sharp contrast to the ageless calm of the country's sweeping savannah, lakelands, mountain highlands and Indian Ocean coastline.

Adagala is here to tell us about the essential dishes visitors to the country should try -- though there's huge diversity here in both communities and in the food.

""I'd say landscape has affected the cuisine of our people,"" explains Adagala. ""The people who are in Turkana or the Masai Mara, they are traditional people and their cuisine is influenced by their livestock. The people at the coast, their cuisine is influenced by the trade they have done with Arabs and Indians.""

l e v a r t

Meat

""People love their meat!,"" laughs Adagala. If it's a gathering or celebration, then nyama choma -- Swahili for roast meat, usually goat or beef -- is sure to be center stage.

""It varies from region to region,"" says Adagala. ""In the west, we might roast goat with eucalyptus wood, but in Nairobi it's just a normal roast and served with kachumbari.""

Kachumbari (or salsa) ""goes well with everything,"" she adds. ""It's very simple to make. I like mine with tomatoes, a splash of lime juice, some onions and chili.""

Ugali, a polenta-like cornmeal slab, is the other essential side dish. It's ""our staple food,"" she says, but it's ""an acquired taste."" Outsiders might complain it's bland, but for Kenyans, it's the ultimate starchy comfort food, and with the right spicy accompaniments, it comes to life.

""Have ugali with some vegetables and a very rich meat dish, like well-cooked tilapia or matumbo, to bring everything together,"" advises Adagala.

Matumbo, or tripe, ""is dark and black and looks like a towel,"" but served up in bao in Nyama Mama's Asian fusion take on a Kenyan classic, it's some of the tastiest stomach you'll eat this year.

""We are not wasteful at all,"" says Adagala. It's not just offal that's on the menu. When the goat is slaughtered for the nyama choma, its blood might find its way into a mutura sausage, a spicy delicacy of offal, garlic, ginger, chili and coriander, all bound together by the red stuff.

Fish and chicken

""Tilapia is the most common fish in our country,"" says Adagala, and, traditionally, it's often fried. The vast Lake Victoria, which Kenya shares with Uganda and Tanzania, is the main producer of freshwater fish.

Uduvi (shrimp) and kamba (prawns) are particularly delicious wa kupaka, which means ""with a rich coconut curry stew."" Kuku kienjeyi -- free-range chicken -- is also a top candidate for the coconut treatment.

Pulses and vegetables

Nyama choma might be popular for gatherings, but when it comes to everyday eating, ""Kenyan cuisine in its essence is actually heavily vegetarian,"" says Adagala.

One of the country's vegetable staples is sukuma wiki, collard greens cooked with onions and spices. Its literal translation is ""end of the week,"" typical of a food culture which traditionally has been more about subsistence than extravagance.

""Mboga is the umbrella term for vegetables,"" explains Adagala. ""We have many traditional vegetables which are common in the western part of the country, whch is where I came from."" Kanzira is African kale, managu is African nightshade and terere is ""similar to wild spinach.""

Adagali recommends trying githeri, a casserole of maize and beans, with a side of avocado, while other popular pulses include ndengu (mung beans) and njahi (black beans).

Every cuisine benefits from a starchy potato fix, so for the Kenyan twist try viazi karai (fried potatoes) or viazi via ryo (potatoes in a tomato and coconut sauce). Mukimo is a vividly hued mash of potatoes and green vegetables while irio is a variant with peas and corn.

And then there's matoke, which is part of the plantain family. Adagala says ""it's a lot starchier, a little bit less sweet"" and ""fantastic for stewing.""

Indian and Arabic influence

Kenya has a large Indian population, a migration which began in the late 19th century when indentured laborers were recruited from British-ruled India to build the Kenya-Uganda railway.

There are plenty of Swahili classics whose names will sound familiar to fans of Indian food -- chapati, samosas, bhajia, biryani and pilau -- although they're given a local spin.

Kenyan chapati, for example, are made with white or all-purpose flour, and are fried in vegetable oil or ghee before serving.

""For festivities, we like having pilau, and also masala fries (French fries with spicy sauce), because they're just considered a bit more festive,"" says Adagala.

Cuisine on Kenya's eastern coast is influenced by the fresh ideas -- and ingredients -- brought in by trading with India and Arabic countries.

""The coastal people are more expressive when it comes to spices, they're very bold and very assertive,"" explains Adagala. ""When you come inland, people like their food more simple. They like tasting the essence of the ingredients. They even consider use of spices as an interruption.

""When you go to the west, we also like our food more simple. The only difference is we put more traditional salts. We like smoking our meats; we like roasting our meats with specific types of woods.""

Sweet things and drinks

Mendazi -- samosa-shaped but donut-tasting -- are a delicious breakfast treat. Vibibi, rice and coconut pancakes, are another light, fluffy delicacy to start the day.

And of course, you need something to wash them down with.

""We export the best coffee in the world but what Kenyans really love is tea,"" says Adagala. Chai masala, lightly fragrant, lightly sweet, milky tea, is a breakfast classic.

Tea might often be enjoyed at breakfast with nduma, a starchy tuber which is prepared simply by boiling with a pinch of salt.

Alternatively, Adagala prepares it with a crispy coating:

Falooda, an Indian-style milkshake, is another of the imports to have made it here from Asia.

When it comes to street snacks, sugar cane is often seen for sale. Kenyans old and young like to slice it up and suck upon it like a straw.

Where to eat in Nairobi

Nyama Mama is ""one of the best Kenyan restaurants"" in Nairobi, says Adagala. ""It's very popular because it takes Kenyan classics and gives them a nice twist.""

She also recommends Swahili Plate, in the Central Business District, for tasty, no-nonsense local cuisine, and for nyama choma she recommends Roadhouse Grill and Carnivore. ""Carnivore does everything from beef to crocodile to duck. Everything!,"" she says.

And for Kenyan-style gourmet burgers, her top tip is Mama Rocks, at hip hangout and ""creative hub"" The Alchemist.

It chose the name Mami Wata or ""Mother Ocean,"" a mermaid-like spirit from West African folklore with long, flowing hair who, followers believe, can charm snakes.

The Cape Town brand designs and produces surf wear, surfboards and accessories. Launched in 2017, it aims to move perceptions of surf culture away from western stereotypes and towards ""the power of African surf.""

Surf company Mami Wata is aiming to represent the growing diversity of African surfing.

""Surfing's history has been told through the lens of Australian brands and American brands, which is largely a blond-haired, blue-eyed story, whereas actually there's a lot of people that story isn't relevant for,"" Mami Wata's co-founder Nick Dutton said.

The company is trying to change that by telling a different story.

But would you be able to enjoy it if you knew it was made from bug ""milk?""

Gourmet Grubb, a Cape Town-based start-up, is hoping to use ice cream to introduce the public to the world of eating insects.

Its luxury ice cream uses EntoMilk , a dairy alternative made by blending the larvae of a tropical insect known as the black solider fly.

The UN predicts that the world will need to double food production to feed the global population by 2050 and has long promoted insect farming as a sustainable alternative protein source to traditional livestock.

Everybody loves ice cream

""We set out to change the way insects were seen, produced and used in the food industry,"" said Leah Bessa, who co-founded Gourmet Grubb in 2017.

Although over 1,900 insect species are estimated to be consumed by humans worldwide, insects are yet to reach the mainstream of Western cuisine.

The insect ""milk"" ice cream is made with natural ingredients, such as raw honey, cocoa, spices and organic peanut butter.

""We were expecting a lot of push back, however people have been extremely open minded,"" Bessa told CNN. ""Everybody loves ice cream.""

The ice cream flavors include chocolate, peanut butter and Christmas spices. According to Bessa, EntoMilk has ""a slightly earthy undertone"" and gives the ice cream ""a rich, creamy taste.""

But it's not just about the taste -- Bessa says insect ice cream is also high in nutrients. According to Gourmet Grubb EntoMilk is five times higher in protein than dairy.

According to the UN, it is widely accepted that insects provide nutrients that are comparable to meat and fish.

""Insects are inherently high in fat and protein and minerals,"" said Bessa. ""The black solider fly has protein and fat content comparable to beef, and zinc, iron and calcium that are much higher than that of beef.""

EntoMilk is also lactose-free and gluten-free, and unlike dairy milk it does not contain any carbohydrates or sugars.

Environmentally friendly

""We decided to focus on an industry [food] that is under a lot of pressure due to animal welfare and environmental concerns,"" said Bessa. ""Insects aren't sentient beings, and they only grow in the conditions in which they thrive, so the farming conditions cater to their animal welfare needs.""

EntoMilk is a dairy alternative made from insects. It is full of nutrients and environmentally friendly to farm and produce.

According to Gourmet Grubb, liter for liter , EntoMilk is more water and energy efficient to produce than any dairy milk or dairy milk alternatives.

""Insects need very little water, feed and space to grow,"" Bessa explained. ""They also produce little/no greenhouse gases compared to traditional livestock.""

Because insects can be farmed indoors in small, controlled environments they can be reared in urban areas, reducing the impact of transporting the milk to the city. It also means they are less at risk of being impacted by external climate patterns, which would affect cattle and crops.

There is also potential for insect farming to reduce waste.

""Some insects, like the black solider fly larvae, have the ability to feed on a wide range of organic matter,"" said Bessa. ""For example, the spent grain left over from brewing beer is used to feed the larvae.""

The future of food?

Currently, Gourmet Grubb's ice cream is only distributed in South Africa, but the global edible insects market is predicted to reach $1.2 billion by 2023.

As well as ice cream, Gourmet Grubb helps develop savoury dishes. These are polenta fries made with mopani worm powder.

Last month, Gourmet Grubb also opened a concept popup store, which included savory insect dishes such as insect powder pasta, chickpea black-larvae croquettes and mopani worm hummus, to serve alongside its ice cream.

""We need to find alternatives that will be able to sustain the growing population and create a sustainable and environmentally friendly farming system,"" said Bessa.

""The only way EntoMilk can truly make a difference and reduce the pressures of traditional dairy is if it is accepted and consumed on a global scale."""

The Beatles and The Stones topped the charts, shoppers flocked to Carnaby Street and the mini skirt and Mini car were in maximum demand.

Amid that cultural sea-change, England's football team won the World Cup on July 30, 1966. It's the first and only time that's happened and England defender Nobby Stiles' celebratory dancing jig encapsulated a nation's delight.

Fast forward to October 30 and a nation mourned as Stiles died at the age of 78 from prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

Stiles is one of a number of ex-footballers diagnosed with dementia and his death has intensified the debate surrounding the sport's worrying relationship with degenerative brain disease.

Soon after Stiles' death, it was disclosed that Bobby Charlton, a World Cup winner with England in 1966, has dementia. Jack, his brother and former 1966 teammate, died with dementia earlier this year.

Of the 11 players that started that 1966 final for England, at least five, including Ray Wilson and Martin Peters, went on to develop some form of dementia or Alzheimer's disease, while former striker Helmut Haller, who scored for West Germany in the final, passed away in 2012 having suffered from Parkinson's disease and dementia in later life.

Tributes are paid to Nobby Stiles outside Old Trafford ahead of his former side Manchester United's game against Arsenal earlier this month.

More than 50 years since England's World Cup triumph, football is still coming to terms with the scale of the problem it faces.

""When you go into football at a young age, and certainly as a young professional, you realize that in the later stages of your life, you're going to have ankle problems and knee problems and back problems, very much like I have,"" Alan Shearer, the English Premier League's record goal scorer who fronted a BBC investigation into the link between football and dementia, told CNN in 2017.

""Never did I ever think that football could also give you a brain disease.""

'Mitigating potential risks'

A study conducted by the University of Glasgow last year revealed that deaths from neurodegenerative disease are around three-and-a-half times higher among former football players than expected.

Players are also twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease, approximately four times as likely to develop motor neuron disease and five times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.

According to Dr. Willie Stewart, a consultant neuropathologist and part of the team that compiled last year's study, the findings suggest football's approach to heading and head injuries needs to change.

""I think if football doesn't change, we could be looking down the line and saying the Liverpool football team that won the championship in 2020, putting a ring around four or five of them saying that, unfortunately, these guys passed away with neurodegenerative disease because that's the kind of level we're talking about,"" Dr. Stewart tells CNN Sport

""Unfortunately, because of the numbers we brought forward last year, having five players from a team in 1966 ... with neurodegenerative disease is in line, unfortunately, with our statistics.""

The Charlton brothers, Jack (left) and Bobby, were both part of England's victorious 1966 World Cup team.

The Football Association (FA) and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), along with the Irish and Scottish FAs, ruled out heading in practice for players aged 11 and under to ""mitigate any potential risks"" that might be linked with heading the ball. This was guided by the results of last year's study.

In 2016, U.S. Soccer banned any heading for under-11s, while European governing body UEFA issued heading guidelines for young players earlier this year but stopped short of any form of ban.

However, Dr. Stewart thinks work needs to be done on an international scale: ""I don't see a global game approach -- I see a global game approach to not doing anything,"" he says.

""FIFA have not been in touch (following last year's study). FIFA have not taken forward this result, FIFA have not made any statement that they're going to do something.

""This is a big sport, it's the world's most popular participation sport. Taking the research forward is going to improve lifelong health and reduce the risk of dementia.""

In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesperson said: ""As far as brain injuries in football are concerned, FIFA takes its responsibility very seriously as protecting the health of players is -- and will remain -- a top priority in developing the game.

""FIFA has made tackling this issue a key objective of its medical subdivision and has established an Independent Football Concussion Advisory Group that will further discuss and evaluate research on the topic of concussion and brain injuries.

""This group will work hand-in-hand with FIFA's medical subdivision, which in parallel will liaise with the Concussion Expert Group (CEG) to advise on adapting the Laws of the Game, to ensure the wellbeing of all players.""

It has also been proposed that trials of additional permanent concussion substitutes could begin in January 2021.

'We shouldn't relax'

Dr. Stewart also notes the case of Marius Zaliukas, a former defender for clubs in Scotland, England and his native Lithuania, who died 11 days before his 37th birthday having been diagnosed with motor neuron disease, according to his former football club Hearts.

""I think it just highlights to me that whilst a lot of people will look at the weekend and talk about Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton and think about dementia, we're really talking not just about elderly, older men with dementia,"" says Dr. Stewart.

""We're talking about young men with problems as well. And I don't think we should lose sight of that. And we shouldn't relax and say this problem's from a bygone era.""

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) -- a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head traumas -- has a well-established association with contact sports, most notably in the NFL

When it comes to football, signs point towards heading as the aspect of the game causing CTE to develop in players' brains.

""It's not from concussions because concussions are a rare event in football,"" says Dr. Stewart. ""But head impacts are a very common event in football -- heading is part of the game, heading in training is part of the game.

""You may watch a game at the weekend and there's only five headers for one player, but he may do 80 or 100 a day during the week.""

Support for former players

The PFA has set up a dementia helpline to provide support for ex-players and, along with The Sporting Memories Foundation , has produced a guide to living with dementia.

Sporting Memories is the world's first charity dedicated to using sports-based reminiscence to tackle social isolation, low mood and dementia among older adults.

Many of the members are former professional or amateur footballers for whom remembering their playing days can help combat some of the effects of dementia, such as memory loss and cognitive impairment.

Sporting memorabilia -- footballs, photos, sticker albums or team kits -- can play an important role.

""Being able to share memories of playing football or playing other sports, they're the memories which are really powerful and often they're very positive memories as well -- feelings of when you were fit and able and running around and all the great conversations in the changing rooms and on the pitch,"" Chris Wilkins, co-founder of Sporting Memories, tells CNN Sport.

""We've got our own retro ball that we bring along to the groups as well; the smell and the feel of all these things, they all tap into those long-term memories.

""It's amazing what's triggered. People with quite advanced conditions can suddenly remember a specific game or the entire squad; how a goal was scored or what the weather was like.""

There are now over 120 Sporting Memories clubs in England, Wales and Scotland which organize activities such as quizzes, discussions or gentle exercise that help spark positive memories.

The foundation works with football clubs across the UK to support former players who have been diagnosed with dementia.

""It really is about the individual, because there are lots of forms of dementia and everybody's diagnosis -- and how they present with a diagnosis -- is different,"" says Wilkins.

""It's about looking at the individual in front of you and playing to their strengths -- what cognitive strengths they still have, what issues they have, and just trying to engage them and to make them feel comfortable and part of the group."""

It will be Garcia's first missed major since the 1999 US Open.

""After 21 years of not missing a Major Championship, I will sadly miss The Masters this week,"" the Spaniard wrote on Twitter on Monday.

""The important thing is that my family and I are feeling good. We'll come back stronger and give the green jacket a go next April.

Sergio Garcia plays a shot during the first round of the Houston Open.

""On Saturday night after driving back from the Houston Open, I started feeling a bit of a sore throat and a cough. The symptoms stayed with me on Sunday morning so I decided to get tested for COVID-19 and so did my wife Angela. Thankfully she tested negative, but I didn't.""

The 2020 Masters, which was postponed from it's usual April slot because of the coronavirus pandemic, will begin on Thursday.

Garcia last played in the first two rounds of the Houston Open last weekend. He failed to make the cut.

The event was the first on the PGA Tour in the US to allow fans back on-site.

""Our hearts and prayers go out to Sergio and his family and we will miss him greatly,"" Fred S. Ridley, chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, said in a press conference on Monday. ""One of our great former winners here at The Masters.""

A pin flag is seen during a practice round prior to the Masters in 2019.

Honoring a legend

In Ridley's pre-Masters press conference, he announced that the tournament will honor Lee Elder, the first Black man to compete in the Masters.

Elder first competed in The Masters in 1975 and would later qualify for five consecutive years between 1977 and 1981. His best finish came in 1979, when he tied for 17th place.

As well as announcing that Elder would be an Honorary Starter for the 85th Masters Tournament in April, 2021 alongside Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus -- a moment that will ""recognize his courageous life and commemorate all he has done in his career to help eliminate barriers and inspire Black men and women in the game of golf and beyond"" according to Ridley -- the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club revealed the creation scholarships at Paine College, a Historically Black College and University located in Augusta.

Elder becomes the first Black golfer to participate in the Masters Tournament in 1975.

The two scholarships will be awarded annually, one each to a student athlete who competes on the men's and women's golf team. The Masters will also fund the creation of a women's golf program at Paine College.

""The opportunity to earn an invitation to the Masters and stand at that first tee was my dream, and to have it come true in 1975 remains one of the greatest highlights of my career and life,"" Elder said . ""So to be invited back to the first tee one more time to join Jack and Gary for next year's Masters means the world to me.

""It also gives me great pride to know that my first Masters appearance continues to make a positive impact on others. Throughout my career, helping young men and women achieve their dreams through education has been a cause close to my heart. I am deeply honored to share a connection with Paine College and these scholarships, which will provide life-changing opportunities for the deserving recipients."""

On Saturday, the United Kingdom banned travelers from Denmark due to the outbreak. UK citizens and visa holders will be able to return but will have to quarantine with all members of their household for 14 days.

""The decision to act quickly follows the release of further information from health authorities in Denmark reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus (COVID-19) in mink farms, with a variant strain of the virus spreading to some local communities,"" said the UK government in a statement.

The new travel guidance has created complications for several international football fixtures, with the Danish national team's matches notably affected.

Denmark is set to play at home to Sweden and Iceland in the coming days. Iceland is then due to travel from Denmark to England to play Gareth Southgate's side in the final Nations League group stage match on November 18.

In a chaotic contest at the Mestalla, Karim Benzema gave the visiting side the lead with a superb strike from the edge of the area, before Carlos Soler scored a hat-trick of penalties and Raphael Varane conceded a bizarre own goal to hand Valencia a convincing victory.

Soler is the first player to score a treble in La Liga from the penalty spot this century, according to Opta

On each occasion, Thibaut Courtois dived the right way but failed to deny Soler, who saw his first effort saved by the Real goalkeeper before a VAR review allowed the Valencia midfielder to retake it.

""We played well for the first half hour but after the goal we crumbled and the dynamic of what we were doing changed,"" Zidane said following Real's second league defeat of the season.

""That was a turning point as after that everything went wrong for us: three penalties, an own goal ... It's a bit difficult to explain our performance today. We started well and after the equalizer everything changed.""

Soler celebrates sealing his hat-trick of penalties.

Soon after Benzema's opener midway through the first half, Valencia was awarded its first penalty following a Lucas Vazquez handball.

Soler's attempt was saved by Courtois and his rebound hit the post before Yunus Musah turned in what looked to be an equalizer.

However, a VAR review judged that Musah and Vazquez had entered the penalty area too soon. Soler retook his spot-kick and made no mistake second time around.

Valencia took the lead when Varane chipped an attempted clearance over Courtois into his own net just before halftime as both defender and goalkeeper unsuccessfully scrambled to keep the ball out.

The misery continued for Real into the second period when Soler scored his second penalty after Maxi Gomez was fouled in the box by Marcelo. He completed his hat-trick after a Sergio Ramos handball.

""It's not something that you experience every day. It's something strange,"" said Soler of his hat-trick.

""I've been taking the penalties this season and the responsibility fell to me. I was caught out on the first one, but thankfully we were able to retake it.

""My teammates showed me support after the miss, and Maxi (Gomez) told me that I was going to score the retake. (Denis) Cheryshev did as well. Everybody helped me, and the win is down to everyone.""

Sergio Ramos reacts during Real Madrid's defeat, in which he conceded a penalty.

Valencia is now ninth in La Liga after a stuttering start to the season that included three consecutive defeats last month, while Real is fourth with a game in hand over leaders Real Sociedad and Villarreal.

Fixture congestion

It's been an unprecedented start to domestic seasons across Europe, with surprise leaders in some of the continent's major leagues.

As well as Real Sociedad leading La Liga, Southampton topped the Premier League table for the first time ever after beating Newcastle 2-0 on Friday. And that was after having lost its first two games of the season, including a 5-2 hammering at home to Tottenham.

AC Milan leads the way in Italy ahead of Sassuolo, which has never finished higher than sixth in Serie A; defending champion Juventus is currently fifth.

It is, of course, early days. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp suggested that a crowded fixture schedule is putting too much pressure on certain teams, and that may go some way to explaining why some clubs are struggling more than expected.

He pointed to Tottenham having to play in Bulgaria on Thursday night before a midday kickoff away at West Brom on Sunday, as well as Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's calls for better scheduling.

United played a Champions League match in Turkey on Wednesday night and then faced Everton on Saturday at 12:30 pm local time.

""The only problem is we injure the players. We cannot keep the players fit with that. That's really the problem,"" said Klopp after his side's draw with Manchester City, adding that broadcasters, alongside the Premier League and the FA, have to try and find a better solution.

""Sky, BT, Premier League, BBC, whoever -- they have to talk. We cannot deal with that situation like we always did before. It's very important the FA has to be involved.

""Tonight we lost Trent Alexander-Arnold and I'm pretty sure (England boss) Gareth Southgate is not fine (with that).""

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola also voiced concerns about the schedule and said he'd like to see the Premier League introduce a rule permitting five substitutions per game.

""I am surprised (about not introducing five subs). I don't understand. But the show must go on. It's about protecting players,"" Guardiola said

""The situation today is exceptional and all the leagues around the world see that, except here.

""LeBron James won the NBA title and then will go on holiday for two months, three months. These guys had two weeks.""

Neither the Premier League or the English Football Association immediately responded to CNN's request for comment.

56,,https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/09/sport/voyager-olympics-munich-spt-intl/,NASA: How a set of athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics were immortalised on Voyager space mission,"‘Do not return without a victory!’

‘Do not return without a victory!’

As the golden disc team was hastily collating their picture album of humanity, they couldn’t escape the politics of the day; the late 1970s represented the mid-point of the Cold War. It is a testament to the integrity of their mission statement that these American scientists and researchers included such a prominent image of a Soviet icon, Borzov.

As he was making his final selections, Lomberg felt that the presence of Rigby and Borzov, an American and Soviet featured so prominently in adjacent images, provided an element of balance and fairness.

However, given how bitterly competitive the two programs were during the space race, he has often wondered if the Soviets would have extended America the same courtesy -- had the Golden Record been compiled behind The Iron Curtain.

To any alien life form in the distant future, such a detail will be utterly irrelevant but the gesture wasn’t lost on Borzov himself; he remembers how Communist Party members tried to motivate the Soviet team in 1972, saying “It’s a golden jubilee, 50 years since the formation of the Soviet Union! You’re going into the enemy’s lair! Do not return without a victory!”

He’d already traveled the world and explained, “We knew better than them how Americans actually behaved. I remember what was nice -- a hot dog and a glass of Coca-Cola. We didn’t need that kind of rhetoric instilled in us before our departure.”

“We knew better than them how Americans actually behaved. I remember what was nice -- a hot dog and a glass of Coca-Cola. We didn’t need that kind of rhetoric instilled in us before our departure.” Valeriy Borzov

Borzov was vaguely aware that his image was associated with the Voyager project, but only because some local journalists wrote about it several years later. And until CNN contacted him, he’d never seen the picture.

Surprisingly, he doesn’t particularly like it, exclaiming, “It’s not the best photo!”

“Firstly, the running position is not the best. The starting position is when the muscles are visible and there is a certain posture where you can see power and character -- this is some sort of frame between moments.” He went on, “I don’t like such photographs and this is one of the preliminary races, a work-in-progress, not the historical one. It’s not the final shot.”

Nonetheless, he has wondered why he was chosen. Without prompting, he volunteers that he ran as a clean athlete, without resorting to the doping techniques that marred much of the Soviet athletic program. “I wasn’t inflated,” he said, noting that you can tell the difference between “a running cockerel and a broiler chicken.”

Maybe he was chosen for his running style, which -- in his words -- could be described as “classic, light and with great power and intelligence.” Or maybe it was his all-around character, his “unification of power, sportiness, physical qualities, intellectual, psychological and other gentleman-like qualities.”

Borzov is now learning the truth about how and why he was sent to the stars and his reaction is humble and earthly: “To be told that you are flying outside of our civilization would be a kick to a sane person. But the most important thing is that it’s a compliment from the Americans. That deserves both praise and gratitude.”

“This is something that obviously really touched me, and this is something that cannot be measured.”

‘Blown away’

‘Blown away’

Of all the Voyager athletes, it’s clear that Rigby has the greatest understanding of the project; it’s something that she has spent a fair amount of time thinking about.

Like Roberts, she wishes that she’d been asked, but only so that she could have watched the launch and enjoyed it in the moment. “I would have said yes anyway,” she added quickly.

“I was blown away,” she said. “I don't often mention it and I don't know why I don't, because besides being born, having children and dying, it is the most profound thing I can imagine in a person's life because you get to be a representative of humanity.

“It’s like an adventure that you’ve been put on and you just go, ‘Wow, why me?’”

After retiring from her gymnastics career in 1972, Rigby has spent much of the rest of her life performing on stage. It’s somehow fitting that she became well known for playing Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie’s fictional character -- the boy who could fly amongst the stars."

At the age of 16, Priscilla Frederick-Loomis attended a model agency casting session in New York City where she was told that she was ""too heavy.""

Even now at the age of 31, those two words still play on the Olympic high jumper's mind. Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that's a dream she hasn't given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.

""I'm going to use track and field as a way to make a name for myself,"" Loomis, who is a two-time Pan American Games silver medalist and competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, tells CNN Sport from her home in the US. She represented Antigua and Barbuda, where her father is from.

Pursuing a career in track and field hasn't been easy.

""When you are trying to be an elite athlete, on top of trying to get signed on, on top of dealing with coaches, you also have, the pressures, one for me, of being an African-American female representing a Caribbean island. And you're adding on top of all that body shaming.""

Loomis competes in the women's high jump final at the Pan American Games in August 2019 in Lima, Peru.

'Don't eat ... jump better'

If the modelling industry left Loomis scarred and dissatisfied with her shape, then perceptions of her weight have also impacted her sporting ambitions.

Even though she never thought she had an eating disorder, Loomis remembers a conversation she had with her college nutritionist, asking: ""'How can I be anorexic and be an athlete?'""

""When I said to my nutritionist that I want to be anorexic, never did I mean I want to have an eating disorder. The power of the word wasn't apparent to me.

""Now, I look back like and think, 'What the hell was wrong with me? I didn't even realize a lot of female athletes have eating disorders.""

But at that point in her career, that's what Loomis felt she had to do to be successful given she was 158 lbs and is 5 ft 10 tall, which she noted is six inches shorter and at least 20 pounds more than her rivals.

""In my head, it was common sense: don't eat a lot, look better, jump better,"" said Loomis, who remembers a time at college when her then coach Richard Fisher advised her to grab something to eat after a training session.

""I wanted an ice cream, a little ice cream,"" she says as she demonstrated how small the size was.

Except another coach told Loomis to put the ice cream down.

""In my head, that stuck with me for so long because I was like, 'I'm making bad decisions. I'm fat,'"" says Loomis.

Loomis competes in the high jump final at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

'One in a billion'

According to US-based eating disorder expert Dr. Gayle Brooks our culture emphasizes and overvalues thinness as the health and beauty ideal.

""When this cultural value system is combined with the pressures of athletic competition, which places an emphasis on diet, appearance, size and weight to achieve peak performance, it places some athletes at high risk of developing disordered eating and possibly eating disorders,"" Dr. Brooks told CNN Sport.

Dr. Brooks is the vice president and chief clinical officer for the Renfrew Center, a US-based clinic specializing in eating disorders treatments. Over Brooks' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.

According to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.

""We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women's disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders,"" said Dr. Brooks.

As she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.

""I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month. One time I was just like, 'I really would love a donut, or I really would love a cupcake' and I have a sweet tooth.""

However, according to then-coach Richard Fisher, Loomis wasn't eating enough.

""We started working together, she was eating maybe three meals a day tops. Everything was low and minimum.

""She would be so hungry, she would eat unhealthy things as anyone, and her lack of nutrition was hindering her from performing the correct way that she needed to.""

The track and field coach adds: ""A lot of coaches look at, I would say the average high jumper who's professional and look at their height and their weight ratio.

""They use that as the standard for what they believe an athlete should be, which in reality is not true all the time. Yes, it might be the perfect standard of what you want. But a lot of these athletes, you have to realize, are one a billion.

""Priscilla always used to say to me, 'I'm the shortest, fattest high jumper out there.'""

Once she's finished competing Loomis wants to pursue an acting career.

'Loving myself'

According to World Athletics, in a statement sent to CNN: ""There is no one kind of body measurement requirement to qualify for the Olympics. That is not the case. There is no such requirement. The qualifying standards are all based around performance.""

Last year World Athletics released a Nutrition Consensus Statement providing the latest research and guidance around nutrition to athletes, coaches and administrators.

In a statement sent to CNN Sport, the International Olympic Committee also said it ""stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement, which is reflected in the Olympic Charter, Fundamental Principle 6.

""The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

""Furthermore, athletes' safety and wellbeing is a priority and a core value for the IOC, which is committed to leading and supporting the Olympic Movement in the implementation of safeguarding measures, in line with its mission stated in the Olympic Charter to promote safe sport and the protection of athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse.""

Even Loomis' teammates were all too quick to chime in with disparaging comments about her appearance.

After Loomis' appearance at the 2015 Outdoor World Championships in Beijing, she says she was called ""thick"" and ""heavy"" by her teammates from Antigua and Barbuda. And that was after she had just competed on the track.

The Antiguan and Barbuda Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.

Three years later she placed fifth in the high jump at the Commonwealth Games in Australia. She went to the bar to grab a beer to celebrate when a man, who recognized Loomis from her famous purple hair, came up to her and said, ""Oh, I saw you on TV. If you would drop a few kilos, you would have performed better.""

As a result of those comments, Loomis says she would drink a pot of coffee to dehydrate herself to appear slim on screen.

Loomis is currently working with a female coach, Lauren Biscardi, a former New York state champion in high jump, who the 31-year-old athlete says has ""changed my professional career. She has helped me love training, love myself and has allowed me to feel.""

Loomis competed at Rio in 2016 and has ambitions to compete at the Tokyo Olympics and at Beijing 2022.

Cleaning business

Growing up, the African American athlete says she did not see anyone she could relate to in the advertising industry. She says she wanted to be ""light skinned,"" but as she has discovered the idea of self-love, Loomis realized that she does not want other women ""to wish they had to be different to be pretty.""

""I do think that the color of my skin and my beautiful chocolate skin color are sometimes deemed as negative and not marketable,"" added Loomis.

""Viola Davis said it best, 'If you're darker than a paper bag, you're deemed not sexy.'

Off the track, Loomis has had to be creative in finding ways to fund her sporting career.

""I make $12,000 a year,"" she says, referring to her sporting income. ""When people hear that, they're like, 'There's no way,'"" she says, ""I'm like, 'Yes I have an Olympic solidarity with Antigua and it's $1,000 a month but that has to cover everything, which it doesn't.""

For her Olympic appearance in 2016, she had to move in with her coach Fisher and start her cleaning business.

Now, she lives with her husband Kenneth Loomis, a high school teacher and coach, but she still oversees the cleaning business.

""It gets exhausting. It gets tiresome. I clean just about three to four times a week. All of my clients are about an hour to an hour and a half away. So, with that, I have to start by 8 a.m. I'll clean for four hours.""

""My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid,"" says Loomis.

She trains two to three hours after she's done cleaning.

""As much as most people think that I'm making all this money, I'm just, you know, faking it till I make it,"" says Loomis, who is now training to take part at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Her goal is to become a three-time Olympian and if she makes it to Beijing -- Loomis plans to compete in the monobob, the one-person bobsled event.

Of those acting ambitions when she finally leaves track and field behind, Loomis says she wants to start attending acting classes, adding that Storm, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman are the three superheroes that she dreams of playing.

""I want to entertain people. I want to entertain large crowds. I want to make them feel things the same way that I feel from movies and get these emotions.

""Right now, at 31, I look back and realize that my story is incredible. My pain is valid, my perception is valid, and my success is valid. I'm not just another strong Black woman, I'm a powerful voice that won't allow other opinions to weigh her down or belittle herself. That's what makes me a winning athlete."""
58,2020-10-29 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/sport/nfl-black-quarterbacks-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,"The NFL is confronting racism, but are Black quarterbacks continuing to be stereotyped?","(CNN) To his frustration, they talked about Patrick Mahomes' arm rather than his decision making as if brawn somehow mattered more than brain.

Despite monetary success and awards, Black quarterbacks, past and present, say they still face an uphill battle against prejudice, especially when entering the league.

For quarterbacks who threw for more than 3,000 yards in 2019, three of the top four -- as ranked by passer rating -- were Black: Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson.

That leaves out their individual rushing efforts too, of which Jackson's was substantial, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards as well as throw for over 3,000 yards.

That success has run over into 2020. Wilson's current passer rating is 119.5 which, if the season ended today, would be the third-best season passer rating ever.

Russell Wilson is having the best season of any quarterback this year, holding a passer rating of 119.5.

This NFL season's opening game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans featured two of the most exciting young talents in the game: 2018 league MVP and 2020 Super Bowl MVP Mahomes of the Chiefs and the Texans' Deshaun Watson.

Last year's league MVP Jackson joins the duo in this group of top Black quarterbacks, alongside veterans Wilson, Dak Prescott and reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year Kyler Murray.

Prior to his devastating season-ending injury in week five, Prescott had been leading the league in passing yards, attempts and completions this season.

Mahomes is the highest-paid player in the NFL, having signed a contract extension during the off-season with the Kansas City Chiefs reportedly worth nearly half a billion dollars.

Mahomes recently signed a 10-year contract extension reportedly worth nearly half a billion dollars and, while not on that level, Watson has signed a $156 million four-year contract extension. Alongside Wilson, the trio are the top three highest earning players in the NFL.

Are we seeing a change in attitudes and treatment, or is the struggle still as prevalent as ever?

Historic experience

Few know the battle African American quarterbacks have faced like Warren Moon. The 63-year-old Moon, is the only Black quarterback in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but didn't have an easy route into the league.

Having gone undrafted in 1978, Moon went to Canada, winning five consecutive Grey Cups -- the Canadian Football League title -- before he was given a chance in the NFL with the Houston Oilers in 1984, aged 28. He says what he experienced wasn't racism, but rather racial stereotyping stacked against him.

""If it was racism then they [Black players] wouldn't be allowed to play the game at all,"" he told CNN. ""But the stereotype was that we can only play certain positions.

""And the quarterback position was the position that a lot of people didn't think we could play for different reasons, whether it was the leadership, whether it was being able to think, be able to make critical decisions at critical times. You know, be the face of a franchise, all those different things that go along with being a franchise quarterback.""

Warren Moon is the only Black quarterback in the NFL Hall of Fame.

While Moon believes things have improved for Black quarterbacks since he entered the league, has enough changed?

According to Pro Football Reference , when Tom Brady entered the NFL in 2000, eight of the 31 starting quarterbacks during each team's opening game of the season were Black.

In 2020, 10 Black quarterbacks started for the now 32 teams in their respective first games. This was down to nine by week two after an LA Chargers team doctor accidentally punctured one of the quarterback Tyrod Taylor's lungs when attempting to administer a shot to Taylor's ribs.

When 60% of the league's players are Black, and 70% of the players identify as people of color, according to The Institute of Diversity and Equality in Sport, the number is significantly lower than it statistically should be.

In a response to CNN, the league in a statement said: ""There are a record-setting 10 starting Black quarterbacks this season. The two highest-paid players in the NFL are Black quarterbacks. The last two seasons' MVPs have been Black quarterbacks.

""The NFL is undertaking short-, intermediate-, and long-term diversity identification initiatives for both non-football and football personnel to ensure more opportunities for African Americans in leadership management positions across the league.""

League entry

The battle for Black quarterbacks begins with entry into the NFL. According to a leading academic, Black quarterbacks have historically found it more difficult being drafted into the league than their White counterparts.

Dr. Judson L. Jeffries, a professor of African American and African studies at the Ohio State University, says Black quarterbacks have been historically perceived as less intelligent, seen instead as simply athletes.

""The knock on Black quarterbacks was they didn't have the intellect or academics to play the position,"" he tells CNN. ""They could run, but when it comes to learning a playbook, reading defenses, learning sophisticated schemes, they weren't able to do that.""

2008 quantitative study by Jeffries and Matthew Bigler showed that ""draft experts buy into and perpetuate racial stereotypes about Blacks that adversely impact Black college quarterbacks' chances of matriculating to the National Football League.""

The study also said: ""Blacks are consistently rated more negatively in the areas of leadership and intelligence/decision making.""

2017 essay by Rockell Brown Burton, a professor of media, and Tristan F. Jones, a contributing writer and journalist, published in the book "" Africana Race and Communication ,"" went as far to say that the ""study is evidence of the modernized social construction of Black quarterbacks by mass media, with a primary focus on their physical attributes and descriptions that better resemble auctioned slaves than chosen leaders of men.""

Though Jeffries thinks a lot has changed in the intervening 12 years since his study, he continues to have reservations about whether perceptions of Black and White quarterbacks are equal.

""Now it appears in 2020, much to my surprise but much to my delight, that [prejudice] has dissipated significantly in terms of judging Black quarterbacks that way,"" he says.

""However, here's the rub: Even though things have significantly progressed, a lot of scouts and coaches when they see an African American quarterback will immediately frame them as someone who is a great athlete, as opposed to someone who is a great quarterback.""

Jeffries cites the treatment Jackson received when he entered the league.

A Heisman Trophy winner as a sophomore at the University of Louisville, Baltimore Ravens' Jackson was seen by doubters as just a runner, rather than someone who could throw, make critical decisions and lead too.

Dr. Judson Jeffries, a professor of African American Studies at the Ohio State University, says Lamar Jackson's refusal to participate in run drills was ""huge"" for Black quarterbacks.

At the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine, he refused to take part in run drills, such as the 40-yard dash, to draw people's attention to his passing ability.

Jeffries says Jackson's decision not to take part in running drills, especially the 40-yard dash, was a significant moment in NFL history.

""That was huge,"" he says. ""In terms of standing his ground, verbally, and being vocal that [he is] a quarterback.

""Coupled with that, [Jackson's decision to say] 'I am not going to participate in the kind of drills that will undermine my ability to be viewed as a quarterback and drafted as a quarterback.'""

In other words, Jeffries says, ""Don't draft me and then talk about me playing wide receiver or running back.""

Unfortunately for Jackson, teams that needed quarterbacks didn't want to take the risk.

He fell to the final pick of the first round, where he was taken by the Ravens. Jackson was visibly distressed as he took to the stage to shake NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's hand.

Some four other quarterbacks were taken ahead of him, none of whom have yet approached the same level of success -- including Josh Rosen, whose recent signing to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice squad marks his third team in three seasons.

The reigning NFL MVP, and only the second unanimous MVP in NFL history, Jackson has since proved the doubters wrong.

Lamar Jackson became the second unanimous NFL MVP in only his second season.

A recent Sports Illustrated article about Jackson goes deeper into the Florida native's journey to the NFL and the structural barriers he faced as a young Black quarterback. The article speaks of the dedication and support of his mother and coach, and implies that without them he may not have reached the NFL as a quarterback.

Jeffries says he thinks others in a similar position to Jackson will be inspired and are ""more likely to stand their ground verbally,"" but ""the jury is still out to what degree they will actually take that stand that Lamar Jackson took.""

Jalen Hurts, a 2020 second round selection for the Philadelphia Eagles, went through a similar process after experiencing significant success in college.

With Alabama, he reached the 2017 College Football Playoff title game as a true freshman and was the starting quarterback of the 2018 championship team. After losing playing time the following season to Tua Tagovailoa and winning the SEC title game as an injury replacement, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma and excelled. He finished second in the Heisman Trophy vote his senior year.

Rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts faced question marks over his ability to be an NFL quarterback despite a successful college career.

Despite all of this success at the quarterback position, at the 2020 NFL Combine, Hurts was asked by members of the media if he would consider changing positions. Hurts answered assuredly but respectfully: ""I've always been a team-first guy. But I think I'm a quarterback. I think that's that.""

And, as Mahomes discussed in a recent interview with GQ magazine , this focus on the athletic attributes of Black quarterbacks at the expense of decision-making doesn't end when a player is drafted.

""In my first year, what annoyed me more than anything is that people thought it was just my arm,"" Mahomes said. ""Everybody just talked about my arm instead of talking about how I was making the right decisions, going to the right place.""

He compared his experience to that of Ravens quarterback Jackson. ""He threw for over 30 touchdowns, but everybody just wanted to talk about the runs.""

Scrutiny and prejudice

Having already been drafted in the first round of the 2018 Major League Baseball Draft , the 2019 NFL Draft's number one overall selection Kyler Murray repeatedly had his commitment to football questioned. This was despite firm assurances from Murray of his desire to play in the NFL.

Kyler Murray was named 2019 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.

The scrutiny he faced for his leadership and football study work led to prominent figures, such as ESPN's Stephen A. Smith , to call it ""systemic racism.""

In the same segment, former NFL defensive end Marcus Spears spoke of the way Murray had been picked apart by draft experts as ""play[ing] into the Black quarterback effect.""

Murray proved the doubters wrong by winning the 2019 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

Murray was the first overall selection in the 2019 NFL Draft.

The draft positions of some Black quarterbacks have raised some eyebrows.

Mahomes and Watson were the second and third quarterbacks selected in the 2017 Draft, behind Mitchell Trubisky, a White quarterback and someone whose inexperience was brought into question. The Chicago Bears took him second overall.

Incidentally, Watson has said he thinks he would have been drafted higher had he not been labeled a ""dual threat"" quarterback -- a stigmatic indicator that a quarterback is more of a runner than a passer.

""He's a dual threat, so he can't read coverages; he can't read defenses, he can't be accurate,"" Watson said during a quarterback conference run for Black players.

In 2019, Daniel Jones -- a White quarterback from Duke -- was taken sixth overall by the New York Giants even though Dwayne Haskins, a Black quarterback of college football powerhouse Ohio State, was still available. The choice baffled many, with former pro Cris Carter saying he thought racial bias played a part in the decision.

""I just can't go on without saying this: If Dwayne Haskins, as an African-American, goes to Duke and puts up those mediocre stats -- seventh in the conference. He's not drafted Day 1 or damn Day 2,"" Carter said on ""First Things First"" at the time.

""So, when you start talking about 'a guy can't comprehend' -- that stuff is racial.""

Haskins was drafted 15th overall by rival Washington. Both in their second NFL seasons, Haskins and Jones have yet to turn around their struggling franchises, with Haskins benched after week four.

The Giants were contacted by CNN but declined to comment.

After Daniel Jones (right) was drafted ahead of Dwayne Haskins (left) in the 2019 NFL Draft, some questioned whether the decision was racially motivated.

Positions of power

In a 2019 article in ESPN's The Undefeated , Quincy Avery, who has worked with Black quarterbacks -- including Deshaun Watson and Jalen Hurts -- says that, in the past, ""overt prejudice"" limited the opportunities of Black quarterbacks.

""Today it's systemic,"" he said. ""They are afforded opportunities, but they aren't allowed to be average because they don't have enough decision-makers who look like them.""

2015 study published in the Journal of Sports Economics found that between 2001 and 2009, when controlling for injury, age, experience, performance, team investment, backup quality and bye weeks, Black quarterbacks in the NFL were found to be 1.98 to 2.46 times more likely to be benched than their White counterparts.

Avery said without Black coaches, coordinators and general managers, opportunities for Black quarterbacks are limited.

Mike Tomlin (right) is the longest serving Black head coach currently working in the NFL, having taken over as Pittsburgh Steelers head coach in 2007.

According to the NFL's Diversity & Inclusion Report for 2020 , of the 31 head coaches, coordinators and general managers hired between February 4 2019 and February 2 2020 only seven were men of color: one general manager, one head coach and five defensive coordinators.

During the same time period, six of the 31 departing head coaches, coordinators or general managers were men of color. This means the NFL only made a net gain of one person of color in one of these positions of power from 2019 to 2020.

Two general managers are Black and the Washington Football Team's Jason Wright is the NFL's first and only Black president. Only three of 32 NFL head coaches are Black, the same number as when the league adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003 which stipulated a team must interview a minority candidate before reaching a final decision. As recently as 2018, seven head coaches were Black.

The Washington Football Team president Jason Wright (right) is the first and only Black president of an NFL organization.

As a result of the latest report, the Rooney Rule was amended in May this year. Teams will now be required to interview two minority candidates for head coaching positions, at least one minority candidate for coordinator vacancies and one external candidate for front-office positions.

In its response for comment, the NFL told CNN ""enhancements to [the] Rooney Rule will increase opportunities for growth, development, and advancement for minorities across all facets of the League and clubs, both for non-football employees and football personnel.""

The statement added: ""The league is also implementing universal data collection to gather diversity information from all 32 NFL clubs. This information includes demographic details by position such as race/ethnicity, gender, generation, and more.""

Positive change?

Moon, however, is positive about the direction the league is going, saying Black quarterbacks are now getting the opportunities he wasn't when trying to break into the NFL.

""African American quarterbacks now are getting more opportunities than they ever have before,"" he says. ""And I think that's why you see so many of them flourishing in the league right now.""

The current crop of supremely talented African American quarterbacks, says Moon, are successfully changing people's perceptions of Black quarterbacks.

""Somebody said success is when [you do] something other people want to copy. You see African American quarterbacks are doing very, very well,"" he says, reeling off the achievements of Wilson, Murray, Mahomes and Jackson.

""When other teams see this, they say, 'I want to have a successful quarterback, maybe this is what I need.'

""When African Americans have success, it's going to breed more opportunities for other African Americans. That's what you see going on right now.""

Moon knows that the work he and other quarterbacks, like Doug Williams -- the first Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl and to be named Super Bowl MVP -- paved the way.

Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to lead his team to Super Bowl glory, doing so in the 1987 season.

""We also know that if we did well, if we played well at a high level, that is going to help the next generation of guys get more opportunities,"" he says.

""And we sit down, we see the game flourishing at that position right now for African Americans. It makes us all proud.""

Eric Bieniemy, the Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator, himself an African American, believes it's time to end labels, and says current Black quarterbacks think so too.

""All of these guys just want to be labeled as a football player,"" he said in an August press conference. ""They want to be labeled as a quarterback. They don't care about their skin color.

""They just want to make sure that they're representing and doing it the right way and providing a road map for the next upcoming young black African American."""

The dramatic finish saw a surging Hall overtake Ruth Chepngetich in a sprint finish having made up 40 seconds in little more than a mile by her husband's calculations.

Her time of two hours, 22 minutes and one second improved her previous personal best by 15 seconds, and her second-place finish made her the first American to mount the podium at London in 14 years.

The performance would have gone some way to atoning for the disappointment of pulling out of the Olympic Marathon Trials in Atlanta earlier this year -- likely one of the heartbreaks she had been referring to as she took to social media after the race

""This is the highlight of my career so far,"" Hall tells CNN Sport as she reflects on her London Marathon performance.

Hall crosses the finish line in second place at the London Marathon.

""I feel so, so grateful to be enjoying the sport the most I ever have at age 37. It's been kind of a surprise to still be improving at this age, and I just feel so grateful that I got the opportunity to race.

""It was just a long year of training and faith that there would be an opportunity at the end of it. I put in a lot for this race and to have it all come together and have the race of my life that was just a dream come true.""

Running 'completely alone'

The circumstances surrounding this year's London Marathon, which was moved from April to October and staged only elite races due to the coronavirus pandemic, were unique.

Competitors were tested multiple times before traveling and also upon arrival in the UK.

Wearing social distancing devices that would sound if they got too close to another person, athletes stayed in a bubble in a hotel the week leading up to the race with ""a little, tiny grass loop"" to train on, according to Hall.

For the race itself, each athlete had their own Porta Potti -- ""every runner's dream,"" says Hall, rather than waiting in a long queue before rushing to the start line.

Hall celebrates her performance at the London Marathon finish line.

Rather than start in Greenwich in south London and finish in The Mall in the center of the British capital, the course was also altered to 19.6 laps of St James's Park and no crowds were in attendance -- something that posed a significant mental challenge.

""There were times I could just hear the echo of my footsteps out there because I was running completely alone,"" says Hall.

""I really just had to self-motivate a lot out there because it was a lonely, very quiet run without spectators.

""And I just tried to remember how grateful I was to be competing and (to) have an opportunity in Covid ... and it was really that gratitude that kept me moving forward and then eventually catching people.""

'Adoption is kind of like running'

Hall is now preparing to compete in the Asics World Ekiden in November, a virtual marathon broken up into different legs with runners taking part all over the globe.

Ahead of next year's postponed Olympics, she will turn her attention to competing on the track in a bid to racing the 10,000 meters at Tokyo.

""I'm training in faith right now ... and then you hope that it all comes together in the end, just like London did,"" says Hall.

Away from running, Hall has a busy family life to keep up with.

Together with husband Ryan, who holds the American marathon and half marathon record having retired from the sport in 2016, the pair adopted four biological sisters from Ethiopia five years ago.

""It's been a wild ride,"" says Hall, adding that two of her daughters have also discovered a love for running.

""Adoption is kind of like running. We're training for a marathon and it's a long grind and it's a lot of paperwork. It's a lot of hoops you're jumping through. There's a lot of uncertainty in the process.

""Ryan and I ... we were kind of uniquely qualified in a way to do it, because we know what it's like to persevere.

""Fortunately, they've adjusted to life here way easier than we would have imagined. It's been a lot easier journey than we thought, but it's still our challenge and it's been really rewarding to see them just thriving where they're at right now.""

The Halls' connection with Ethiopia dates back to before 2009 when they founded The Hall Steps Foundation

The charity aims to support vulnerable women and children living in poverty in Ethiopia, where there is thought to be 36 million children under the age of 18 who are deprived of basic goods and services, according to Unicef

Adoption, Hall says, has ""increased our passion for helping people in extreme poverty even more."" The family has been unable to travel to Ethiopia this year due to the coronavirus but hopes to once normality resumes.

For now, Hall has races to train for -- the Asics World Ekiden in November, a marathon in her home state of Arizona in December and perhaps even an Olympics Games next year."

Where did Lewis Hamilton overtake Michael Schumacher's 91 race wins and become the all-time leader in Formula One Grand Prix victories?

History was made on Sunday at the Portimao Circuit in Portugal. A track which has never hosted a F1 race prior to this coronavirus-affected 2020 season, in a country where Hamilton had never raced an F1 car.

Both drivers are regarded as greats, racking up wins with Terminator-like ruthlessness, and Hamilton's career statistics mirror Schumacher's in a number of categories. So how to choose the greatest?

Off to a flying start

In an age where it seems only drivers from affluent backgrounds with heavy financial backing can make their way into F1, it is interesting that both Hamilton and Schumacher's parents sacrificed much for their sons' passions.

While Schumacher's parents worked multiple jobs and relied on the kindness of a local businessman to fund his karting career, Hamilton's father Anthony worked up to three jobs at one time and remortgaged his house.

Parental dedication paid off as both careers got off to a flying start.

Hamilton achieved his maiden F1 victory in only his sixth-ever race, aged 22.

The Englishman might even have won the championship in his debut season in 2007. He and teammate Fernando Alonso finished second and third respectively on 109 points each, with champion Kimi Raikkonen finishing just a point ahead.

Hamilton would have been the youngest F1 world champion at 22 years and 287 days -- a record which would have still stood. Nevertheless, he won the title the following year, at 23 years and 300 days.

With Hamilton starting his career in the then dominant McLaren, Schumacher faced an arguably stiffer test starting out, driving a Benetton car that was competing with some of the all-time great McLaren, Williams and Ferrari cars.

In 1992, Williams' Nigel Mansell won nine of the 16 races that year, with his teammate Riccardo Patrese winning one. McLaren's Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger won five races between them, leaving one remaining: Schumacher's maiden victory.

It came at the same track where he had made his debut just a year earlier: Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. His risk to turn to slick tires from wets earlier than his competitors was an inspired move, and summed up the all-or-nothing approach he took when chasing victory.

The 1993 season was the final year of the Alain Prost-Ayrton Senna rivalry, and in 1994 Schumacher earned his maiden F1 world championship.

Acrimony often followed the German throughout his career, and 1994 set the tone for that.

Despite not recording a point in four races because of race bans, Schumacher took the title -- although it is still debated today as to whether his crash into rival Damon Hill in the final race was intentional or not.

The ultimate test

Some say you can best judge how good a driver is based on their teammates' performances. And both Hamilton and Schumacher have stunning records against their teammates.

Schumacher finished with a better result than his teammate in 68 percent of races he started. Hamilton has a 61 percent record against teammates.

In terms of season finishes though, only twice in his 13 completed seasons has Hamilton been bettered by a teammate. If he continues his dominance in 2020, that record will be two in 14.

Prior to his comeback in 2010, between 1991 and 2006, Schumacher finished behind his teammates in only three of 16 seasons. One of those is arguably irrelevant as, in 1991, Schumacher raced only once for Jordan and five times for Benetton, with Andrea de Cesaris and Nelson Piquet driving in every race for those respective teams.

As an additional addendum, in 1997 Schumacher was disqualified from the drivers' championship due to dangerous driving, while in 1999 he broke his leg at the British Grand Prix, forcing him to miss seven races that season.

When we take into account Schumacher's three years at Mercedes alongside Nico Rosberg from 2010 to 2012 after his F1 comeback, that statistic becomes six in 19 seasons.

Hamilton's blip for Mercedes came in 2016 when Rosberg beat him to win the title in one of the most intense seasons in living memory.

Career-long dominance

It is a testament to the greatness of both racers that they have finished races on the podium more often than they haven't. And with over 40 fewer race starts, Hamilton has a ratio better than one win in every three races.

Only Juan Manuel Fangio (24 wins in 52 races) and Alberto Ascari (13 in 33) have a better win-to-race entry ratio than Hamilton.

For drivers to have entered over 100 races though, only Jackie Stewart, Prost and Senna come anywhere close to these two behemoths.

Hamilton has the edge over the course of a career, winning 35 percent of the races he started.

One anomaly sticks out, however.

The pair's podiums and wins tally are very similar, but Hamilton is head and shoulders in front on pole positions achieved.

For many, this is a point to Hamilton. But, if anything, the deficit between number of poles and race wins is a testament to Schumacher's determination to win. The man just never gave up.

The duo's track history doesn't help us differentiate between them much. Hamilton's dominance at the Hungaroring in Hungary is seriously impressive, winning eight of the 14 times (57 percent) he has driven there. Schumacher is not far behind in his record at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in France with eight wins in 15 entries (53 percent).

For Schumacher to have finished on the podium 12 times at not one but three separate tracks speaks to his consistency.

It remains to be seen whether Hamilton can match that level of dominance at a single track, let alone three.

The future

Hamilton has won eight of the 12 races in this year's world championship.

A victory in the next round at Imola will secure Hamilton a seventh world title, the one big record of Schumacher's he has yet to equal or eclipse.

Schumacher was 37 when he retired for the first time in 2006 and, after his brief return to the sport, was 43 when he completed his final race.

The German has been the benchmark for years. After eclipsing Prost's record of 51 Grand Prix victories in 2001, he had another five years at Ferrari where he continued to accumulate victories.

Hamilton is 35 now, and is showing no signs of slowing down.

Having beaten Schumacher's record, it is within the realms of possibility that the Briton will continue to add to his tally, setting records for years to come.

""He deserves every victory he had. I am sure he will get 100. I don't think you can praise him enough,"" said Sebastian Vettel after Sunday's race, himself a winner of four world titles and 53 races.

At his current rate, Hamilton will reach 100 wins next season, and maybe even reach eight world titles next year too.

Schumacher's greatness is cemented in history. But Hamilton will march on to even greater acclaim for years to come."

They'd set a score for McIlroy to shoot and if he beat it, Diamond bought him dinner. If McIlroy fell short, the tab was on him. More than just for kicks, it helped focus the practice.

But on the Sunday evening of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in February, McIlroy laid on drinks for Diamond, his caddie since 2017, to celebrate his rise back to the world No.1 spot for the first time since 2015. It's a closeness borne out of their junior golf days back in Northern Ireland.

""It was important for me to sit down and have a few drinks with him and be like, we've done this, this was our journey and we did it, two guys that grew up in Holywood, playing golf together, this is something that was really cool,"" McIlroy said.

How well does Rory McIlroy know his career?

Along with Dustin Johnson, McIlroy now sits behind only Tiger Woods and Greg Norman for most cumulative weeks at No.1 with more than 100. He knows Woods' record 683 weeks is unlikely to be matched any time soon. ""It was insane,"" admits McIlroy.

But there is one Woods landmark McIlroy can emulate at the Masters , which was postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

A first green jacket at Augusta would make the 31-year-old only the sixth player to achieve the career grand slam of all four major titles. He would join golfing greats Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Woods in an elite pantheon.

McIlroy has faced grand slam talk before, of course. Since he won the Open in 2014, the Masters has become his holy grail. But with it has come mounting pressure, expectation and heartache.

""I get it every April and it certainly doesn't help things,"" said McIlroy, who has had four top 10s at Augusta National Golf Club in that time but was tied 21st behind Woods' remarkable return last year.

'Opened my eyes'

McIlroy won his four majors in a blistering burst from 2011 to 2014, but since then the well has dried up despite plenty of prestigious PGA Tour wins.

In South Korea in October, 2019, then No.1 Brooks Koepka -- who also raced to four major wins very quickly between 2017 and 2019 -- was asked about his rivalry with McIlroy.

""I've been out here for what, five years? Rory hasn't won a major since I've been on the PGA Tour. So I don't view it as a rivalry,"" he said.

McIlroy agreed Koepka ""wasn't wrong"" but stopped short of retaliating further.

But it's McIlroy's consistency which took him past Koepka back to the top of the world. Four wins in 2019 and nothing worse than fifth place on the PGA Tour in six starts since October tipped the scales back his way.

His return to form coincided -- even was influenced by -- an inner perspective forged from mindfulness practices and the pages of self-help books.

JUST WATCHED Tiger Woods' 2019 career renaissance Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tiger Woods' 2019 career renaissance 03:33

At the Masters last year, McIlroy revealed his routine now includes meditation, juggling and reading.

His favorite books include ""The Greatest Salesman in the World,"" by Og Mandino, Ryan Holliday's ""Ego is the Enemy"" and ""The Obstacle is the Way,"" and Mark Manson's ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k.""

""It's opened my eyes to approaching life in a certain way which I think is a positive,"" he told the PGA Tour's The Cut.

""There's things you can take from it which you can put into your career but you can also put into your life, taking a step back to think about things logically.""

Critics suggest he should have converted more of his high finishes into wins, and McIlroy concedes there are ""good top 5s and bad top 5s.""

But he added: ""My win percentage on Tour is like 10% and I think that's pretty high for anyone not being Tiger Woods.""

Another McIlroy trait has been the occasional blowout round, such as his infamous meltdown from four in front in the final round of the 2011 Masters, or his capitulation alongside Patrick Reed in the final round at Augusta in 2018.

""He is a bit mercurial but that's part of his normality,"" says Shane O'Donoghue, host of CNN's Living Golf show. ""He's not a robot, he is an artist.

""He will have down times, he will have the odd disaster, but my god, the highs more than make up for it because when he is on, he's different class.""

Rory McIlroy surveys his options in the final round of the Masters in 2011.

'Overwhelmed'

The drama of last year's Open at Royal Portrush perfectly encapsulates McIlroy's multiple sides. As the hot and sentimental favorite to win on the tournament's first return to his native Northern Ireland since 1951, he was gripped with nerves on the first tee.

""That was the first time I felt it, 'Jesus, this is huge.' I was overwhelmed,"" he told the Irish Independent. ""I was overwhelmed by the support. I looked up and just thought, 'Holy s**t!'""

He pulled his tee shot out of bounds and amassed a quadruple-bogey eight on his way to a 79. In danger of missing the cut, he launched a swashbuckling attack in the second round, urged on by legions of fans, but his 65 left him one short.

Rory McIlroy made a quadruple-bogey eight to start the Open at Portrush in 2019.

'Ireland's Mozart'

It wasn't supposed to be that way for the prodigy who had set a course record of 61as a 16-year-old at Royal Portrush.

It was supposed to be the coronation of the boy king who had learned the game from his father Gerry at the unassuming Holywood Golf Club, a couple of hours down the road near Belfast.

The young McIlroy was transfixed by Woods' breakthrough major at Augusta in 1997, and when he was nine he wrote to the American, saying he was gunning for him.

His victory in the world Under-10 championship in Florida led to an appearance on a popular TV talk show, demonstrating his prowess chipping golf balls into a washing machine.

""I'd heard the stories of him playing for Holywood Golf Club, walking onto the first tee to play a senior cup match for low handicap amateurs, and his opponents saying, 'Who are you caddying for today?' and he'd go, 'No, no, I'm playing,'"" said BBC Sport Northern Ireland TV presenter Stephen Watson.

Irishman O'Donoghue was equally stunned when he first saw McIlroy in action in 2004.

""He'd just turned 14 and was clearly very different,"" O'Donoghue told CNN Sport. ""He looked like a cherubic little boy but played with an exuberance that was totally different. It was like watching a virtuoso. I very quickly christened him 'Ireland's Mozart,' in golf terms.""

Rory McIlroy and caddie Harry Diamond shake hands on the 18th green during the third round of the 2018 Masters.

A true Holywood star

Though McIlroy was well known on the amateur circuit, he came to wider prominence as a chirpy, cherubic 18-year-old at the 2007 Open Championship at Carnoustie, where he tied for third after the first round, bettering the then 12-time major champion Woods by one shot.

Joining the paid ranks was like adding a spark to rocket fuel. McIlroy has grown from precocious talent into a global superstar, based in Florida with the huge mansion, fast cars and private jet.

But despite the fame, wealth and celebrity status, McIlroy is still very grounded with a close coterie of school friends. When he parted company with long-time caddie JP Fitzgerald in 2017, McIlroy turned to best mate Diamond to shoulder the bag.

He's had the same coach, former Holywood pro Michael Bannon, since he began the game using cut-down clubs.

""He was a nice, normal kid. He hasn't changed,"" adds O'Donoghue. ""Circumstances have changed phenomenally around him and he's had to deal with all of that but he's still the same Rory. At the heart of it he's still Gerry and Rosie's boy.""

Part of that personality is an honesty and openness in interviews. It's got him into hot water at times, but it's also endeared him to fans and media alike.

McIlroy's latest pronouncements on a proposed splinter tour called the Premier Golf League and Tour-wide testing for Covid-19, has earned him plaudits as a leader and statesman.

""I've been around the top of the game for a long time now, over a decade, and I think being at the age I am and being at the stage of life where I'm a lot more comfortable in my own skin and in my own beliefs and values and convictions,"" he said.

""I have been outspoken about a number of issues in golf over the past couple years, and I'm happy about that.""

With golf tournaments returning from the enforced coronavirus break without fans, he was one of the players advocating against a fan-less Ryder Cup, saying the iconic Europe vs. US competition with no supporters is ""not a Ryder Cup.""

The Ryder Cup was eventually postponed and will be played between September 29 to October 1 at Italy's Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in 2023.

A career grand slam would confirm McIlroy as one of the game's greats, a true Holywood star.

In the lead up to the Masters, he revealed he had been ""experimenting"" with adding some more speed to his game in response to what Bryson DeChambeau has achieved after totally revamping his game.

""Bryson, when he speed-trains, he just hits the ball into a net, so he doesn't really know where it's going,"" McIlroy said . ""He's just trying to move as fast as he can ... and sort of making the target irrelevant for the time being and then you can sort of try to bring it in from there.

""From what I've done and what I've been trying -- you know, sort of experimenting with the last couple weeks -- it's the fastest I've ever moved the club, the fastest my body has ever moved.""

If McIlroy does win the Masters this year he would be helped into the green jacket by none other than Woods, tying up a neat narrative that sparked his phenomenal career.

""I've done a lot of great things in golf so it's just a matter of doing it on the right weeks,"" he told Watson for BBC Sport."

He was washed up, they said, yet here he was making a charge at a sixth Masters title at the age of 46. He hadn't won a major for six years, but the ""Golden Bear"" was emerging from hibernation.

The spectators packed around Augusta' sun-dappled 16th green rose to their feet, arms thrust skywards, as the old warrior, his yellow shirt hunched over in that familiar putting stance, sank another birdie to get to within one shot of the lead.

The roars reverberating around the towering pines was ""quadrophonic,"" coming from all sides, according to his playing partner Sandy Lyle. Few could have predicted this kind of hullabaloo.

But Nicklaus, the record 17-time major champion, knew nostalgia couldn't hit the shots for him. He had to quell his own excitement and harness the energy.

""The ovation was unbelievable,"" said Nicklaus. ""I kept getting tears in my eyes, but I was saying, 'Hey let's hold that back, you've got some golf to play.'""

Tiger Woods' remarkable redemption story in winning in 2019 may have sent tremors around the world, but Nicklaus at Augusta in 1986 was equally seismic.

'Gone, done'

Pulling into Augusta National that April, Nicklaus' form appeared in terminal decline. Family and his various business interests had pushed golf into the back seat.

A newspaper story ahead of the Masters, penned by Tom McCollister of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said he was ""gone, done,"" and his ""clubs were too rusty."" A friend of Nicklaus' pinned it to his fridge in the house they were renting in Augusta that week.

Nicklaus knew his career was winding down. But done? Rusty clubs? Not so fast, he thought. And certainly not at Augusta, where he had already won a record five green jackets.

""I might have been 46, but my nerves were still good,"" he said. ""And I did not want to leave the game playing poorly.""

'Pumped'

With his 24-year-old eldest son Jackie as his caddie, Nicklaus opened with a modest 74 but improved with rounds of 71 and 69 to sit in a tie for ninth going into the final day.

Starting four strokes off the lead of Australian Greg Norman, he set off in company with Scotsman Lyle, the British Open champion. ""We weren't really the main contenders; we were probably 30-40 minutes in front of the leaders and after nine holes not much was going on,"" said Lyle.

But the old adage goes that the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. And that's exactly when Nicklaus made his move on an epic, sun-soaked afternoon

He had flickered into life with a birdie at the ninth, and when he stroked in another 25 footer for birdie on the 10th , the needle surged again.

Deep down in Amen Corner -- golf's most revered stretch of holes -- Nicklaus added a third straight birdie with another lengthy putt across the 11th.

""That was the first time I jumped. I was pumped and started getting really excited,"" said Jackie in a TV interview afterwards.

Remarkably, he was now only two shots behind the lead of Norman and Seve Ballesteros, Spain's two-time champion. It threatened to be a short-lived cameo when he pulled his tee shot long and left over the water on the short 12th and made a bogey.

But on the 13th tee fortune was on Nicklaus' side as his attempted drive around the corner flirted with trees lining the left of the hole before settling in the fairway.

""Dad, that was no good for a 24-year-old heart,"" Jackie later recalled saying. Nicklaus Snr. laughed and told Lyle.

""Jack said to me, 'Hear what he just said? What about my old heart?'"" said Lyle.

'The eagle lit a fuse'

From the middle of the par-five 15th fairway, Nicklaus peered down at the lime-bright green beckoning from beyond the pond. ""Jack Nicklaus has 200 yards and he's never needed an eagle more,"" whispered CBS commentator Ben Wright in his polished English brogue.

After much mulling with Jackie, Nicklaus opted for a four iron and stroked the ball over the water, stopping it in the heart of the narrow putting surface, safe from the slick slope behind. A roar rose up from the packed galleries around the green and broke like a wave up the fairway. ""And he's got a very, very good chance,"" said Wright, with a hint of excitement.

On the green, Nicklaus and Jackie stalked the putt, surveying it from every angle. When the din had subsided, he took his hunched stance and rolled it through the shadows and into the hole for an eagle three. Jackie leapt into the air. The thunderous roar told the story. Hope and belief surged for the old favourite. Now just two strokes back. ""Yes, Sir!"" urged Wright. ""The battle is joined. My goodness. There is life in the old Bear yet. Magnificent stuff.""

""That's when I began to think something was really occurring,"" said Lyle, who was leaning on his putter as Nicklaus' ball dropped yards in front of him. ""The eagle lit a fuse and got the crowd going unbelievably and they never stopped from there to the 18th.""

Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April, although it is being held in November in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It's a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It's an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters. Hide Caption 1 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos A is for Augusta National – The revered course has hosted the year's opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner, the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. Hide Caption 2 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos B is for Beauty – The Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia's second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983. Hide Caption 3 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos C is for Caddies – Augusta's caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. Hide Caption 4 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos D is for Dos and Don'ts – The hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later. Hide Caption 5 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos E is for Eisenhower – Former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a member of Augusta National and several landmarks of his era remain, including Ike's Pond, the fishing lake he championed that is the focal point of the Par-3 Contest. Eisenhower's white cabin also sits near the clubhouse. Hide Caption 6 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos F is for Fans (make that Patrons) – Visitors to Augusta National are known as patrons -- not fans or spectators or the crowd. Tickets are like gold dust, but a limited number of practice round tickets and tournament days are available through a yearly ballot. The waiting list for weekly tournament badges closed years ago. Hide Caption 7 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos G is for Grand Slam – Rory McIlroy just needs the Masters to complete the Grand Slam of all four of golf's major titles. The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Hide Caption 8 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos H is for History – Augusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery. During World War II the land was briefly given over to turkey and cattle farming. Hide Caption 9 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos I is for Internationals – South African Gary Player -- pictured here in 2014 with Jack Nicklaus (left) and the late Arnold Palmer -- was the first international champion in 1961. Since then the Masters has been won 21 times by overseas players. The US counts for 60 wins from 37 different players. Hide Caption 10 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos J is for Jacket, as in green – The tropical-weight emerald blazer is worn by only Augusta National members and Masters champions. It was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. Hide Caption 11 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos K is for Key holes – The saying goes the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards. Hide Caption 12 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos L is for Lane, as in Magnolia Lane – The exclusive driveway to Augusta's historic clubhouse is framed by dozens of magnolia trees. Only members and Masters competitors are allowed to access this revered entrance which gives on to the Founder's Circle and then the whitewashed concrete clubhouse, built in 1854. Hide Caption 13 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos M is for Mickelson – Popular left-hander Phil Mickelson is one of 17 players to have won multiple Masters titles. The three-time champion won the first of his five major titles at Augusta in 2004 after three straight third places. Even at 50, Mickelson remains a Masters threat. Hide Caption 14 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos N is for Nicklaus, as in Jack – The most successful player at the Masters is Jack Nicklaus, whose six Green Jackets remains the record. The 80-year-old is now an honorary starter along with Gary Player, following the death of four-time champion Arnold Palmer in 2016. Hide Caption 15 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos O is for Oak tree – The famous old oak tree on the course side of the clubhouse is an iconic landmark and the traditional meeting place for the game's movers and shakers and media types with the correct credential. A familiar refrain of Masters week is: ""Meet you under the tree.""

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, it is just 155 yards long, but Rae's Creek looms large in front and a devilish wind always swirling around the trees makes club selection tricky. Hide Caption 17 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Q is for Quonset Hut – Modern media are housed in a recently built state-of-the-art facility at the far end of the practice range, but in days gone by the stories from Augusta were crafted in a corrugated metal Quonset Hut. Hide Caption 18 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos R is for Roars – When the excitement rises on a Sunday afternoon and the patrons reach fever pitch, the roars reverberate around the towering pines which act like a giant organ reflecting the noise all over the course. A Phil Mickelson roar stands out, but a roar for Tiger Woods is like no other. Hide Caption 19 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos S is for Spieth – Jordan Spieth was on a fast track to being crowned the new king of Augusta following his wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016. He was still clear with nine holes to play before famously self destructing with two balls in the water on 12. The American has struggled of late and is down to 33rd in the world, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th. Hide Caption 20 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos T is for Tradition – The Masters is forward looking but rooted in tradition, such as the pre-tournament Par-3 Contest, in which friends and family members caddie for the players and hit the occasional shot. Jack Nicklaus' grandson Gary made a hole in one last year. Other traditions include the Champions Dinner, in which the holder chooses the menu and hosts the evening on the Tuesday of Masters week Hide Caption 21 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos U is for Under par – When Jordan Spieth won in 2015 he equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record for the lowest winning score at 18 under par.

He went on to win three further Green Jackets, the last of which came in 2005 after a famous chip-in on the 16th. The 43-year-old is fit again after multiple back surgeries, and among the widely tipped contenders. Hide Caption 24 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos X is for X-factor – Winning the Masters requires a game in mint condition and a bit of something special.

As Nicklaus stood in deep shadow on the 16th tee, debutant CBS announcer Jim Nantz asked his summarizer Tom Weiskopf what would be going through his mind. ""If I knew the way he thought I would have won this tournament,"" said Weiskopf, the 1973 British Open champion.

Nicklaus made his swing, the ball soared towards the green, took two hops and then checked and span left, trickling down the slope to three feet below the hole.

The pines, acting like the reeds in a giant mouth organ, amplified the roar. Once the clamor had died down Nicklaus sank the putt for birdie. One back.

""The noise was quadrophonic, coming from above, from the side -- I think even God was laughing,"" added Lyle.

""The Bear has come out of hibernation,"" purred Nantz.

David Cannon took this image of Jack Nicklaus hitting out of a bunker at the 1986 Masters.

'Seve or Jack?'

Behind them, Ballesteros was swashbuckling his way down the 15th.

Veteran golf photographer David Cannon was following the Spaniard, his favorite player. Ballesteros would later have Cannon's iconic image of his 1984 Open victory at St Andrews tattooed on his arm, but now Cannon was wracked with indecision.

""I was following Seve and hearing these epic roars around the course,"" he told CNN.

""Follow Seve or go with Jack? I literally changed direction 10 times. Luckily my brain said, 'hang on, this is the greatest golfer there's ever been and this is his chance to win another major. You have to go there.'""

Cannon diverted from the 15th fairway to wait for Nicklaus behind the 17th. But a huge groan came from down in the valley to his left. Ballesteros, his head bowed in his white visor, had dunked his second into the water on 15.

Nicklaus, on the 17th tee, sensed what had occurred from the roar -- groans mixed with cheers.

His drive drifted left into trees and he had given himself a tricky second shot. Still, he found the green and had about a 12 footer for birdie.

Augusta lore

Cannon lined up behind a little ridge, hoping desperately no one would get in his way.

On the green, Nicklaus and Jackie consulted over the putt. Jackie thought the putt would break right but his dad wasn't so sure.

Nicklaus recalled the Augusta lore that all putts break towards Rae's Creek, the stream that runs in front of the 12th green and is the lowest part of the course.

""You sure?"" asked Jackie.

""'Pretty sure. I think it will come back to the left because of Rae's Creek,'"" he later recalled. ""'There's always that influence back there.'""

Nicklaus barely stroked his putt, starting it left before the ball veered to the right and then, sure enough, straightened back up as it neared the hole.

""Maybe,"" said CBS announcer Verne Lundquist. Nicklaus dropped a knee and raised his left arm in the air with his putter as if to chase the ball into the hole. ""Yes, Sir,"" shouted Lundquist as the ball dropped. Nicklaus' double arm pump punctuated the word ""Sir.""

Cannon fired away as the ball dropped. Nicklaus' raised arm has become another of golf's most iconic images.

""I could see Jack clearly. I had a lovely background with the sun at a beautiful angle and it made an amazing picture,"" said Cannon, who faced a nervous wait until his shots were developed back in the UK the following Tuesday. ""The relief and excitement was staggering,"" he added.

Jack Nicklaus holed a birdie putt on the 17th to take the lead in the 1986 Masters.

'Oh, beautiful'

""Gone, done"" Nicklaus was now the sole leader of the Masters and Augusta was fizzing.

Nicklaus emerged from the maelstrom onto the 18th tee. Digging deep, he unleashed his final drive through the narrow chute of trees and found the fairway.

His second shot from 175 yards came to rest on the bottom tier of the back-to-front sloping green, and he walked up to the final hole through an ear-ringing standing ovation.

""In all my years in golf that to me was most the emotional and largest ovation I have ever heard,"" he said.

Nicklaus' first putt came to rest a few feet from the hole and he drained his next for a par four to seal a blistering back nine of 30 and give him the clubhouse lead at nine under.

He shook hands with Lyle and his caddie Dave Musgrove and embraced Jackie. The pair walked off the green with their arms around each other's shoulders.

""Oh, beautiful,"" said CBS commentator Ken Venturi.

Thanks, Tom

But for all his heroics, Nicklaus' fate was in the hands of others. Tom Kite, playing in the group behind, had a 12-footer for birdie on 18 to force a playoff, but he missed by a whisker.

Despite his dunking on 15, Ballesteros was still very much in contention until a three-putt bogey on 17 knocked him back.

Norman, though, had coming charging back with four birdies in a row from the 14th and was tied again for the lead at nine under after 17.

The Bear was being hunted by the ""Great White Shark,"" as Norman was known.

Nicklaus, watching on from the Jones Cabin, was becoming increasingly anxious and got up off the couch to pace the room.

The Australian flushed his drive up 18, but he pushed his second shot into the gallery to the right of the green, ramping up the drama. From an opening made among the patrons chipped back onto the green, but left himself a 15 footer for par to take Nicklaus into a playoff.

He missed, and Nicklaus was crowned the second oldest major champion ever behind the 48-year-old PGA champion Julius Boros.

Augusta crackled and popped. Golf had never seen anything like it. Veteran writers struggled with their words and thoughts trying to do justice to Nicklaus' feat.

63,2020-10-30 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/sport/league-of-legends-worlds-isolation-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,Worlds 2020: Surviving two weeks of isolation ahead of the biggest esports tournament,"(CNN) Imagine being forced to spend two weeks alone in a hotel room ahead of the biggest competition of your life.

That was the scenario players of the 22 teams competing at this year's League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai, China, faced before they were able to take part in the competition which culminates this weekend.

There had been fears the world's biggest esports tournament wouldn't go ahead amid the coronavirus pandemic, but teams from across the world were allowed to compete if they self-isolated for 14 days.

Players and coaches were confined to four walls for the entirety of the quarantine, only opening the room door to collect food, get tested for the virus and dispose of rubbish.

James MacCormack, head coach of European team MAD Lions -- a team knocked out during the play-in stages -- remembers feeling a little uncertain when he heard of what was in store.

""Our initial reaction was that it was going to suck but that, as professional gamers, it will be fine,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We are used to being indoors for long periods of time. We'd be busy, we'd be practicing. So in terms of that, it would be fine.""

A player arrives at the League of Legends World Championship.

'Really, really odd'

The reality of the situation became crystal clear as soon as the teams landed in Shangai.

Their belongings were sanitized and paperwork filled out before they were whisked off in a shuttle bus to a nearby hotel.

MacCormack says the procedure was meticulous and, after they reached the quarantine hotel, staff ""popped"" them into a room and ""that was kind of it.""

The room, he says, was what you'd expect, but with a few tailored additions.

Organizers had equipped them with an exercise bike, a small desk, a gaming chair, and a computer to help with practice and preparation.

MacCormack was fortunate enough to have a vista of the coast. Many others, however, were stuck with a view of a wall.

He says the initial few days were difficult to deal with as players adjusted to their new settings and suffered from jet lag.

""The days were really, really odd because your sleep schedule is messed up and you're out of contact with everyone else,"" he says.

""You're still getting used to it and you don't have a good routine yet. So those couple of days were actually the hardest for me.""

Mental challenge

As coach, MacCormack felt extra responsibility to look after his players and created a daily routine for them all to follow.

It included waking up at the same time, eating meals together over video chat, and plenty of practice sessions before the start of the tournament.

However, he says the mental strain of working, sleeping and eating in one room was tough and got harder as the days went on.

""I felt really powerless to do anything about it. It's really hard to know what to do in that situation,"" he says.

""We had some really good things, like when our performance manager and our sports psychologist went round to all of our families and all of our friends, and they got them all to record videos.

""There were ways we had of taking the edge off.""

Josh Leesman, head Coach of North America's Team Liquid, found it much harder to do his job in such demanding conditions.

""It's just way less optimal than being in person because some of my strengths are just understanding the mood in the room or being able to empathize with the body language of a player,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""During practice we didn't have webcams on because the bandwidth in the hotel wasn't good enough to support it.""

Team Liquid was knocked out in the group stages of the tournament and whilst Leesman says the preparation wasn't ideal, he didn't use it as an excuse for not progressing further. The final takes place on October 31 between SN Gaming and Damwon.

""I think we realized it was a level playing field. So all of the international teams that came in, we're in the same quarantine hotel, eating the same food with the same computers and the same desk,"" he says.

Day 3 of quarantine:



-Woke up around 8:30, had 2 good nights' sleep, so no more jetlag👍



-First day of solid morning routine (made my bed, meditated, did my stretching/mobility exercises, shaved)✅



-Feeling pretty chilled overall, looking forward to scrims!😃🦁 pic.twitter.com/2Q2jGd5Mfv — James MacCormack (@MacCLol) September 11, 2020

The food

Whilst working on tactics and practicing took up a lot of the day, players and coaches were left with plenty of spare time.

Some exercised, while others binge-watched Netflix. But all had one experience in common: the food.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner were served at the same time every day by staff in full hazmat suits, with an option of either Western or local food.

""A lot of the time your food would arrive and it wouldn't exactly be hot anymore, which was not pleasant,"" MacCormack says.

""We had players that lost a lot of weight during the quarantine ... because they just didn't like the food.""

After being deprived of quality meals for two weeks, many of the players and coaches had one thing on their mind after they were finally transferred to new accommodation: the hotel buffet.

""It was honestly like seeing 100 kids on Christmas Day,"" he says.

""I'm actually welling up a bit now because I remember sitting down with a full English breakfast and just thinking that I've never been so happy in my entire life to see a piece of bacon.""

No crowd

Once quarantine was over, teams were allowed to practice together but had little time to do so before the tournament began on September 25.

Nicolaj Jensen, a player for Team Liquid, had found two weeks alone challenging but said it was worth the hardship to compete on the live stage.

The competition is the most-viewed esports championship in the world, with over 100 million people watching the 2019 edition.

With a Chinese team once again in the final this year, viewership figures are expected to reach similar or higher levels at the weekend.

However, regulations dictated that fans would not be able to pack into the stadium to watch the gamers play live.

""When you hear the crowd get louder, you can feel it. If you make a great play and you notice the crowd, it gets into your head,"" Jensen tells CNN Sport.

""It was obviously a bit less than ideal circumstances. I would have loved to play Worlds with a crowd because that's what I look forward to the most.""

Like much in 2020, this year's championship has represented a new normal and participants have made the best of extraordinary circumstances.

Despite the difficulties they faced, there are few regrets.

""Hopefully we don't have to have another 14-day quarantine in 2021, but hopefully we'll look back on this championship and think 'wow, that was just a really unique experience',"" says Leesman.

""I think any time you share something like that with a group of people, it does bring you closer together."""

During 2020, no golfer has arguably been more talked about than Bryson DeChambeau

The addition of 40 pounds of muscle during lockdown catapulted him to the top of the PGA Tour's driving distance rankings. That prodigious driving also helped DeChambeau blitz his way to his maiden major victory at the US Open

But it's the methods he's employed to revamp his game -- which initially others questioned -- which has made some of his contemporaries sit up and take notice and start to experiment with their own training regimes and approach to golf.

Former world No. 1 Justin Thomas recently told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell that he is ""trying to get stronger"" after seeing what DeChambeau has done.

Meanwhile four-time major winner Rory McIlroy admitted that he's also looking to bring some added speed to his game in an attempt to just keep up with the 2020 US Open winner.

""For the last couple weeks, I was working on some stuff,"" said McIlroy ahead of the CJ Cup in October. ""I think as a golfer, we're so ingrained to trying to hit the ball where you're looking, and I think that's one of the great things that Bryson's done.

""Bryson, when he speed trains, he just hits the ball into a net, so he doesn't really know where it's going,"" added McIlroy.

""He's just trying to move as fast as he can ... and sort of making the target irrelevant for the time being and then you can sort of try to bring it in from there.

""From what I've done and what I've been trying -- you know, sort of experimenting with the last couple weeks -- it's the fastest I've ever moved the club, the fastest my body has ever moved.""

DeChambeau plays his shot from the ninth tee during the final round of the 120th US Open on September 20, 2020.

In a league of his own

It's not as if McIlroy is struggling for driving distance. In the early stages of the 2021 PGA Tour season, he had the third highest average of 333.4 yards. He's now in fifth on 325.3, but in 2017 and 2018, McIlroy led the tour in average driving distance.

But DeChambeau is still streaks ahead of the Northern Irishman in terms of average driving distance, averaging 344.4 yards this season.

During the American's explosive six-shot victory at Winged Foot Golf Course at US Open, McIlroy was tied for eighth spot, a whopping 10 shots behind DeChambeau.

And the 31-year-old found it ""hard to really wrap"" his head around what DeChambeau was doing.

""He's worked his ass off to do that and it's paying off hugely,"" McIlroy said.

McIlroy plays a shot from the second tee during the third round of The CJ Cup.

""I think it's the way the game's going. I got sent a really good article last weekend, it was in the Wall Street Journal, just about every single sport becoming faster, longer, stronger, and I don't think golf's any different. I'm just trying to keep up with the way it's going.""

As players fine tune their preparations for the Masters, which starts on Thursday, November 12, by playing in other events, DeChambeau has adopted a different approach, according to golf.com.

There were four PGA Tour events between the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in October and The Masters. DeChambeau chose to not to take part in any of those events.

After competing at the TPC Summerlin tournament, DeChambeau says he was planning to work ""out like crazy"" in attempt to add even more muscle, before focusing on his driving.

""I don't know how many drivers I'll hit, but I'll hit as many as I need to,"" DeChambeau said . ""And from a speed-training perspective, I could probably go upwards of over 1,000 to probably 2,000, around 2,000 drives the next four weeks trying to get my speed up.""

And according to Justin Rose, there's a ""trickle down effect"" inspired by DeChambeau.

""I'm hearing kind of rumors out on the range, everyone's trying to crank it up a little bit, get a few more miles an hour,"" Rose told reporters.

Even 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas, who admits he thought DeChambeau's attempts to overhaul his game weren't ""going to work that well,"" is now full of praise for the 27-year-old.

Thomas looks on over the 18th green during the final round of The CJ Cup.

""He just won a major at one of the hardest golf courses in the world. And at the end of the day, as far as he hits it, as strong as he's gotten, as much weight as he's put on, he putts the crap out of it to be perfectly honest. I mean, he putts it really well and that's why he won that US Open.

""It's not because he can hit it 360 yards. It's because he putts it really well and he's a complete golfer. And I think that's starting to show. But it's definitely an advantage how far he hits it. And it's pretty cool.

""He's getting some of us out here to try to find that extra gear. But at the end the day, he's going to continue to work hard and try to get stronger.

""And you just hope that he doesn't hurt himself like a lot of, I guess, other people have trying to get stronger and get fit. But I know that's what I'm doing. I'm trying to get stronger. But most importantly, I'm trying to continue to play injury free."""

A gesture that gained widespread attention -- especially when social media swept into action.

""People are speaking out and saying very positive things. Thanks for standing up, thanks for saying something,"" Triplett told CNN Sport.

""We really appreciate your story and getting some of these anecdotal stories from people both White and Black about experiences that they've had and the more of those kind of things that we hear and that we share, I think the better we all understand each other.

""So for me overall, I've been kind of surprised and feel pretty good about that the outreach and the things that people have told me.""

Kirk Triplett poses with his golf bag, along with the Black Lives Matter sticker.

Passion for adoption

For Triplett, the matter is deeply personal.

The three-time PGA Tour winner and wife Cathi are the proud parents of four children.

""We have twin boys that are 24, they are biological. We have a daughter who is 20 and a son who is 18 and they're both adopted. Our daughter is Hispanic and our son is half African-American, half Japanese,"" the 58 year-old revealed before sharing more on the family's passion for adoption.

""When you see our family out around town, you know exactly what we're all about. Raising a family and trying to teach kids the right way to do things and trying to give them opportunity in the same way our parents gave us opportunities.

""So it's a great story, adoption. There's some difficulties at times, but there's difficulties with your biological kids, too. But it is a great story. Great for the kids. It's great for the families. And more important, it's great for the community.""

Triplett describes his 18-year-old son Kobe as a ""typical"" teenager for his age.

""I think he faces the same challenges any young African-American male faces, just sort of an uncertainty from the world around him,"" says Triplett.

""Looking at him based on what he looks like, if he's in the wrong place at the wrong time, what's going to happen?

""Is this situation going to escalate or is he going to have the ability to kind of manage it and control it and let it de-escalate a little bit?

""But I guess my fear, or my what bothers me, is why should that be his responsibility? Why should he be the one that has to make it slow down and make people react a different way? That shouldn't be his responsibility. That should be the system's responsibility.""

The Triplett family is pictured in an old Christmas photo, from left: Kirk with his wife Cathi, son Sam, adopted daughter Lexy, adopted son Kobe, and son Conor.

'I understand and I agree with you'

This year has seen some of the biggest names in sports take a stance against police brutality and social injustice in the US -- including global megastars like Lebron James of the Los Angeles Lakers.

It was also a year that saw the words 'Black Lives Matter' painted on the courts inside the Orlando bubble and when the season re-started almost all players kneeling during the US national anthem.

Triplett says that due to his family situation he has just a ""very unique, small sliver of understanding about what some of the African-American community is going through.""

As an avid consumer of news events, he says that recent tragedies have hit him hard.

The American, who's also now an eight-time winner on the PGA Tour Champions, says it was never his attention to try and change people's minds or even make a ""big statement.""

However, there is one powerful point he's at pains to get across.

""I think first and foremost, my message is to the African-American community that here I am in a demographic that you think is not hearing what you're saying. And I'm hearing it. And I understand and I agree with you,"" he says.

""Well, now, where do we go now? Now what do we do? And there are more people like me. Most of them just don't put stickers on their bags.""

More to do

Earlier this year, the PGA Tour said it expected to raise over $100 million towards racial and social injustice causes over the next decade -- a move Triplett welcomes.

""The golf demographic is a great demographic, right? It's people are educated, people are affluent. People are committed to charitable work. They want to make the world a better place and I think the world of golf can help. ""

That being said, he feels there's still much work to be done.

""I think nobody's doing enough yet but we are making some progress. I like what the Tour has done. The Tour has some very good people that are involved in this process,"" he adds.

""It's easy to just sort of earmark some money and hope you make a difference. The Tour is investigating ways to make sure that they do more than that and I'm looking forward very much to being a participant in those programs.

""We want it to be more than you'll put a sticker on the bag or throw money at a cause. We don't want to decide what to do with it. We want help and we want partnership. We want the African-American community to let us know what to do."""

Former world No.1 Justin Thomas was skeptical of the revolutionary methods Bryson DeChambeau adopted in his search for success.

Dubbed 'The Scientist' due to his willingness to test his boundaries and trial new technology, DeChambeau returned to the golf course following the coronavirus hiatus 40 pounds heavier having spent hours in the gym. It was a weight gain that allowed him to hit the ball even further -- DeChambeau comfortably leads the PGA Tour's driving distance rankings.

The revamp reaped immediate rewards for the American, as he won his maiden major, romping to a six-shot victory at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York last month.

DeChambeau's success and transformation is described by Thomas as ""unbelievable.""

DeChambeau celebrates with the U.S. Open trophy after winning at Winged Foot Golf Club.

""I'm the first to admit that I didn't think it was going to work that well and I didn't necessarily agree with what he was doing,"" Thomas told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell.

""But he's proven it. He's just won a major at one of the hardest golf courses in the world,"" added Thomas, who has also been impressed by DeChambeau's putting.

""As far as he hits it, as strong as he's gotten, as much weight as he's put on, he putts the c**p out of it to be perfectly honest.

""He's getting some of us out here to try to find that extra gear. He's going to continue to work hard and try to get stronger.""

Thomas is also conscious of getting ""stronger,"" but he's taking it step-by-step.

""You just hope that he [DeChambeua] doesn't hurt himself like a lot of, I guess, other people have trying to get stronger and get fit. But I know that's what I'm doing. I'm trying to get stronger. But most importantly, I'm trying to continue to play injury free.""

Thomas plays his shot from the third tee during the third round of the TOUR Championship on September 6, 2020.

Golf without fans

2020 has been an extraordinary year for golf. Having had to postpone all tournaments for three months, competitive action has returned but without fans.

The absence of the energy that spectators bring to tournaments is the ""hardest part"" of playing in the Covid-19 era, according to Thomas.

""We're so fortunate to get to do what we love to do,"" the 2017 PGA Championship winner explained. ""We're getting to do our job still. We're getting to play competitively.

""We have it so much better than a lot of people do and myself and a lot of us, all of us don't take that for granted. And the fact of not being able to play in front of fans, although it's a bummer, things could be exponentially worse.

Thomas lines up a putt during the third round of the 120th U.S. Open.

""So we don't take it for granted. We were happy to be able to do what we love and hopefully bring joy to people at home watching, because that's something that I think we all can't get enough of this year.""

For Thomas, the 2020 PGA Tour season has been one of his more productive. He won three events, finished second in two -- including the season-ending Tour Championship -- and third in another.

His most recent victory came at the World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in August. But the pandemic has taught the 27-year-old Thomas to ""appreciate things more.""

""I'm so incredibly lucky. And to get to do what I love to do and again, to continue to do what I love to do, I mean, there's so many people out there, even not in Covid times, that don't get the luxury of a lot of things that I and we get to do.

""And during all this and with small businesses struggling and people around the world having a hard time, especially in our country. But I try to get better and I hope I have gotten better of just being more appreciative of what I have. And you never want a pandemic like this to be able to do that but, unfortunately, it's happened and hopefully that's come from it.""

Thomas holds the trophy after winning the World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational.

Goal setting

Thomas was speaking to CNN Sport ahead of the 2020 edition of the CJ Cup, which has a total purse or $9.75 million. Last year, he won his second CJ Cup title, an event that was first played in October 2017.

Normally played at the Nine Bridges Golf Club on Jeju Island, South Korea, this year's edition was moved to Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, Nevada because of the pandemic.

""I have set my goals. I actually set them on the flight out here. Usually I would have done it before the U.S. Open, but it was such a quick turnaround, to be perfectly honest, I just completely forgot.""

Thomas hits his tee shot on the 9th hole during the final round of the 2019 CJ Cup.

Although he admits it is a shame that he won't be able to defend his crown at a course where he's had ""a lot of success,"" Thomas says going with the flow is what he's learnt to do in this extraordinary year.

""I think that's something that we're all learning this year, is that you have to make the best with the situation that you have. And the PGA Tour has done an unbelievable job of that this entire year. And Shadow Creek as a backup is about as good as it gets."""

Both Lewandowski and Haaland scored, but what Saturday's ""Der Klassiker"" really revealed is that Bayern remains in a class of its own in German football after the Bavarian club won 3-2 at Signal Iduna Park.

Haaland went even further, describing Bayern as ""the best team in the world.""

The win sent Bayern two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table. RB Leipzig is second on 16 points, with Dortmund third on 15 points.

Erling Haaland of Dortmund and Robert Lewandowski Bayern Munich chat after the Bavarian club's 3-2 win at Signal Iduna Park.

'Deserved win'

In the first half's closing stages Marco Reus' instinctive finish put Dortmund ahead, but just before the interval David Alaba's deflected free kick pulled Bayern level.

""David Alaba's goal just before half-time was important,"" said Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, per the Bundesliga website. ""That allowed us to have a breather feeling a lot calmer.""

After the restart, Lewandowski's glancing header gave Bayern the lead as the Polish striker equaled his own record of scoring 11 goals in the first seven games of the season, just like last season.

Dortmund's Thomas Meunier, left, and Bayern's Robert Lewandowski challenge for the ball during ""Der Klassiker.""

'Sensational game'

It was also Lewandowski's 17th goal in 13 games against his former club.

Substitute Leroy Sane's fierce shot put Bayern 3-1 up, though Haaland's 83rd-minute effort ensured a tense finish.

""It was a sensational game,"" said Bayern head coach Hansi Flick, per the Bundesliga website

""There was an incredible amount of quality out on the pitch and there were a lot of chances at both ends. We were a bit more clinical, more efficient in front of goal. The win was more than deserved.""

Bayern's victory means the Bundesliga champion has now scored 102 goals in 31 games under Flick. That average of 3.2 goals per game is the highest for any Bayern coach.

Bayern has lost just twice during 2020 and last season won the Champions League and German Cup as well as the Champions League. In September, Bayern also beat Sevilla to win the UEFA Super Cup.

Flick's team has also netted 27 goals in seven games, equaling the record set by Borussia Mönchengladbach in the 1973/74 season.

In those seven league matches, Lewandowski has scored 11 times -- that's a goal every 42 minutes, with the 32-year-old forward also contributing four assists.

Dortmund's Norwegian forward Erling Braut Haaland (C) scores Dortmund's second goal in the 3-2 defeat by Bayern Munich.

Haaland might have ended up on the losing side, but the 20-year-old Norwegian once again showcased his goalscoring brilliance.

His goal was his 19th in 21 Bundesliga games, a record bettered only by Uwe Seeler, who netted 20, while Lewandowski scored five in his first 21 matches.

Despite that record of nearly a goal every game, Haaland believes he should be scoring more.

""It's about getting the best out of me and the whole team and then we will be on the same level as Bayern,"" said Haaland per the Bundesliga website

""But right now we're not, so Bayern are a better team and the best team in the world. That's how it is.""

Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre pinpointed some of the chances his team missed in the first half as an explanation for the defeat.

""Obviously there were a lot of things that we could have done better. We created a lot of chances, we countered and we could have won the game."""

Everton went ahead through Bernard's shot, but two goals from Bruno Fernandes ensured United were ahead by halftime.

Edinson Cavani's first goal for United wrapped up the win in stoppage time to provide some much needed respite for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

This was the visitors' third consecutive away win in the Premier League in a season that has seen Solskjaer's side lose three times and draw once at home.

The win pushed United up to 13th in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Southampton.

MLB investigators found that Turner thought he had received permission from at least one Dodgers employee to join his teammates on the field on October 27 after Los Angeles defeated Tampa Bay four games to two , Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.

Turner also was ""actively encouraged"" to leave an isolation room and join teammates for a photograph, the commissioner said.

""Many teammates felt they had already been exposed to Mr. Turner and were prepared to tolerate the additional risk,"" Manfred said.

Turner apologized in a statement.

""I sincerely apologize to everyone on the field for failing to appreciate the risks of returning to the field,"" he said. ""I have spoken with almost every teammate, coach, and staff member, and my intentions were never to make anyone uncomfortable or put anyone at further risk.""

He also said he should have waited until his teammates had cleared the field before returning for a photo to celebrate his first World Series win and the first for the franchise in 32 years.

Justin Turner, bottom center, poses for a photo with his Dodgers teammates, manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman after testing positive for coronavirus.

The commissioner said he thought Turner, a third baseman who hit .320 in the World Series and is a free agent, showed remorse for his actions.

""We all have made mistakes as we navigated these unprecedented challenges and have tried to learn from those mistakes so they are not repeated,"" Manfred said, ""With this in mind, I am closing this matter by applauding Justin for accepting responsibility, apologizing and making a commitment to set a positive example going forward.""

The commissioner said the league could have handled the situation better by having someone stay with him and having him taken back to the team's hotel sooner. Dodgers President Stan Kasten said Friday that while events ""unfolded rapidly and chaotically,"" they will improve the way they handle similar events in the future.

MLB has said the team did contact tracing after the final game and followed quarantine measures. There were no other positive tests announced.

Initially Turner stayed away

Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, hosted the World Series. Turner left the final game in the sixth inning and spent the final two innings in a doctor's office near the clubhouse.

Turner initially didn't join his teammates on the field for the post-game celebrations and tweeted: ""Can't believe I couldn't be out there to celebrate with my guys!"" He also said he felt great and had no symptoms.

However, he did eventually return to the field to celebrate, hugging his teammates, posing for photos with the roster and at times not wearing a mask."

Brown was officially activated to the Buccaneers' playing squad from the suspended list having served his eight-game suspension for multiple violations of the league's personal conduct policy

The wide receiver is on course to make his season debut in Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints.

The 43-year-old quarterback Brady, who played with Brown during their time at the New England Patriots, has offered to let the 32-year-old wide receiver live with him while he finds a place to live in Florida.

""Antonio is a good friend of mine and again, we've gotten to know each other pretty well over the years,"" Brady recently told Westwood One's Jim Gray.

Brady says he's keen to help Brown settle in at the Buccaneers.

""He's just getting settled and I know he's looking for places, but it's just nice to be able to have him around,"" added Brady.

""We're getting to work and he likes to be integrated into what we're doing. (It's) a big transition for him moving across the state really not knowing anyone.

""Again, just trying to be a great teammate and help someone out who is a friend of mine.""

And Arians says that Brady helping Brown reacclimatize to the sport will help the wide receiver focus on being productive.

""He (Brown) has to handle his own business off the field,"" Arians said during a press conference. ""On the field, you find your role, accept it, embrace it, make sure you're making the right plays and we'll get you the ball.

""He's (Brady) publicly talked about trying to help a teammate [and] doing whatever it takes to get him comfortable so they can focus on football. That's Tom -- he's the ultimate teammate.""

In June, Brown was sentenced to two years of probation after pleading no contest to charges stemming from an incident in which he allegedly assaulted a man at his South Florida home.

A former offseason athletic trainer filed a lawsuit against Brown in 2019 accusing him of rape and assault in 2017 and 2018.

Brown denied the allegations and said he would fight to clear his name. The NFL said at the time there was an ongoing investigation into Brown's conduct.

Brown while he was a member of the Oakland Raiders.

'He'll have his role'

That case is set for trial in December in Broward County, Florida, according to NBC's Pro Football Talk website. Brown's legal representatives didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Brown spent the first nine years of his careers with the Pittsburgh Steelers before joining the Oakland Raiders ahead of the 2019 season. He was released before playing a regular season game.

He signed with the Patriots soon after and played just one game -- catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown from current Buccaneers quarterback Brady -- before being released.

Brown officially signed for the Buccaneers on October 27 and he was able to attend meetings and work with the team's strength coaches last week while finishing his suspension. He was able to start practicing with his new team on Wednesday.

And although he's been away from the NFL for a while, Arians predicts Brown will ""have his role"" on Sunday against the Saints.

Arians speaks at a press conference.

""We'll see how much we can get him taught,"" Arians said. ""And the first practice will be a walk-through because we've got a short week coming off Monday night, so we basically miss a practice this week on Wednesday because of the short week, so it'll be a walk-through practice and basically all learning.

""He'll have his role -- it could be 10 plays. It could be 35 plays. I wouldn't anticipate 60 plays, for sure, but we'll just see how it goes.""

A seven-time Pro Bowler, Brown has 841 receptions for 11,263 yards and 75 touchdowns over his career. He had in excess of 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns every season from 2013-18."

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

Ian James in Riyadh at the start of the Formula E 2019-20 season.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

""Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future."""

The victory was trainer Joseph O'Brien's second in the Melbourne Cup as Twilight Payment -- piloted by jockey Jye McNeil -- led from the start and held off late challenges from Tiger Moth and Prince of Arran.

Known as the ""race that stops a nation,"" this year's Melbourne Cup was held without spectators amid the coronavirus pandemic and proceedings took a tragic turn with the announcement that 2019 Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck had sustained a fatal injury.

""It is with sadness that we confirm that Anthony Van Dyck had to be humanely euthanized after sustaining a fractured fetlock during the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington,"" said Racing Victoria's Jamie Stier.

""The horse received immediate veterinary care, however he was unable to be saved due to the nature of the injury sustained.

After going clear in the first round, Maher rode into a packed O2 arena in the second round in the knowledge another error-free ride would hand him victory over Ireland's Darragh Kenny and Balou du Reventon, who had been leading with two time faults over two rounds.

Maher, an Olympic champion at his home London Summer Olympics in 2012, knows all about performing under pressure.

But for a split second, it looked as if Maher had thrown it all away. Approaching the third fence, the big-striding Explosion W touched a pole. It bounced up in the air as the crowd gasped, but didn't fall.

""I took some risk, I didn't go too fast to jump the clear round,"" said Maher, whose win was applauded by American rock star Bruce Springsteen. ""I had some luck over there on the pink one and it stayed up. I knew it would be my day,"" said the 36-year-old Maher, the only rider to produce two clear rounds.

""I just tried to keep my eye on the job, but I know, when he touches a fence like that, normally, he doesn't touch another fence in the course,"" said Maher. ""I had a little luck, that's what sports is all about.""

An emotional Maher also paid tribute to his team.

Maher and Explosion W finished their stellar season on a high in Prague.

""Just amazing feeling, to be able to win here, on this horse, and the people that are around me, to make this possible, they all know who they are. It's an amazing feeling towards the end of the year.""

GCL Super Cup

The four-day Global Champions Playoffs will end on Sunday with the €6.4 million GCL Super Cup for teams.

Last year, Eduardo Alvarez Aznar of Spain teamed up with Holland's Marc Houtzager and Maikel van der Vleuten to take the inaugural GCL Super Cup for the Madrid in Motion team.

Madrid in Motion will join Paris Panthers, Valkenswaard United, Shanghai Swans, Monaco Aces and Cannes Stars in Sunday's final, which will see the winning team ride away with €3 million in prize money.

Friday's semifinals saw the shock elimination of pre-event favorites London Knights, led by Maher, and the St. Tropez Pirates.

The London Knights had finished the regular season at the top of the leaderboard for the second year running, with €2.3 million in prize money. The Pirates, led by last year's LGCT Super Grand Prix champion Edwina Tops-Alexander of Australia, had finished the regular season in second place, with €1.7 million in earnings."

Palmer penned an emotional column in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday about the mental health challenges he faced while confronting his sexuality and how he hopes to inspire others in the future.

""I despised myself and the life I was living,"" Palmer said of the season he made his international debut, when he was also vice-captain of Super Rugby side the ACT Brumbies.

""I was trapped in a false narrative and could see no way out. Most nights, I cried myself to sleep ... I fantasized about disappearing, changing my name and starting my life all over again. It is not an exaggeration to say my own death felt preferable to anybody discovering I was gay.""

The ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" song is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals, rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

In the aftermath of George Floyd's death, the RFU said in June it was reviewing the song's use at games, saying many fans might not be aware of its ""historical context.""

In a statement released on Thursday, the organization, which oversees English rugby, said it intends to educate fans ""on the history and provenance of the song as well as providing platforms for diverse voices across the game.""

""The RFU needs to step up its efforts to improve diversity and inclusion across our game,"" RFU Chair Andy Cosslett said. ""We are living through testing times, but this will not deter us from grasping the opportunity to better reflect the society we live in.

The American star is now just two race wins behind Austrian great Marcel Hirscher , who retired last year, and fourth on the list of all-time World Cup winners.

She trails compatriot Lindsey Vonn , who also ended her glittering career last year, by 17 victories. Sweden's slalom legend Ingemar Stenmark holds the record with 86.

Shiffrin, who will be 25 on March 13, is traditionally a slalom and giant slalom specialist but her second career downhill victory has cemented her lead at the top of the standings as she chases a fourth straight World Cup overall season title.

Already this season Shiffrin had won three slaloms and a giant slalom race, but victory in Bansko was her first of 2020.

Vonn won four overall crowns between 2008 and 2012, while Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell holds the women's record with six overall titles, awarded to the skier who has performed the best across all disciplines.

90,,https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/04/sport/liverpoolpremierleaguetitle/,​​Liverpool: The agonizing wait for a first Premier League title,"1990 / 91 30 years of dreaming Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football’s biggest prize

Gary Gillespie doesn’t remember how he and his teammates celebrated Liverpool winning the English first division title in 1990. “We probably got together and had a few drinks and reminisced about the season,” the former Liverpool defender tells CNN, chuckling at his hazy recollection.

There was little reason to especially savor that year’s yield, Liverpool’s 18th league title and Gillespie’s third in five seasons, because winning was what the club did. Springtime in Liverpool was the season for picking up trophies.

There was satisfaction and relief, an uplift to the red half of the city after a heartbreaking decade, but not the intoxicating hit on the senses that usually comes with the glory of being the best in the land.

Liverpool, it was assumed, would do it all again in the seasons to follow, or come close at least. No one knew the 1989/90 campaign was an ending, a full stop on what had been an unforgettable sentence in English football history.

“Everybody was used to winning and maybe took it for granted, and, anytime you take anything for granted in life, sometimes it comes back and smacks you in the face,” says Gillespie, “and that’s exactly what happened because we’re talking about this 30 years down the line, and Liverpool haven’t managed to win a title since.”

This year was supposed to be different. Jurgen Klopp’s men were 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City, within two victories of winning English football’s biggest prize, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the world to pause.

As the 30th anniversary of the club’s last league title success is marked, the wait continues. Agonizing, uncertain, with the story of the club’s revival missing its final page.

‘Managed decline’

1980s Britain. Margaret Thatcher’s decade. The city of Liverpool is fighting for survival.

The docks, once the heartbeat of Liverpool's prosperity, have been in decline since the 1970s. Manufacturing is shrinking, economic stagnation is sharp, the population is in decline, inner-city homes are falling into decay and unemployment is high. The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.

“Liverpool was being forced on its knees,” lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. “I remember Chelsea fans used to wave £20 notes at us and say, ‘we’ve got loads of money.’”

On a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London's streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana's wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.

Widely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the ‘uprising.’

“This was a city without leadership,” wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.

“We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83

In the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcher’s closest ministers talked of a “managed decline” of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher's finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: ""We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""

It was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.

But during these divisive times the people had football, two of the country’s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, “inexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.”

From 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.

Liverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shankly’s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.

“I was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,” Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. “If you finished second it was deemed a failure, you’d had a poor season regardless of what else you’d won.""

The league title was, says Gillespie, the ""be all and end all” and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.

“We never got allowed to get carried away,” Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the club’s success.

“The coaching staff were always calling us ‘big heads’ and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I don’t think we needed it.

“When we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didn’t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.”

A city grieving

Though football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.

On April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.

Players had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpool’s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.

Adding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper ‘The Sun’ immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.

“It [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,” says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.

At the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.

Arsenal’s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.

No one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal's Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.

At the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.

“When Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; they’d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,” says Gordon.

Business as usual

For those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool's players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.

“The coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,” Gillespie explains.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

Liverpool’s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for £600,000 ($670,472).

The new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.

Meet the 1989/90 squad

Yet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade … it was a remarkable achievement,” says Gordon.

“We’d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasn’t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.”

Relief for a job well done

The smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfield’s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.

Attending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool's players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club's idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

“It was all fairly understated,” Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. “It was exciting, it was good, but if you’d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until they’d win the next one, they wouldn’t have believed you.”

For the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. “You put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,” says Gillespie. “Fortunately for us we were normally successful, but I don’t think you can enjoy it [a season].”

English football goes global

But at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: ""Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.""

On the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.

The city’s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.

“Kenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,” said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.

As a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.

But this was a man who had taken on the city’s grief.

In a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpool’s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.

He had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian club’s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.

“It all started going wrong when Kenny left,” says Gillespie.

The cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.

Thirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English football’s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.

This is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpool’s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of football’s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the club’s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfield’s capacity to 54,074.







In an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.

His greatest challenge, he said, was “knocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.”

With 20 league titles to Liverpool’s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.

Back on their perch?

Some fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.

The family has experienced close calls over the last three decades – second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season's astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren't unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.

This season, however, Klopp’s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in England’s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.

Postponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.

The nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory – though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point – had vanished this season.

Winning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Klopp’s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.

Joy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool's charge to the league title.

Whether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, ""the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.""

""I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,"" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. ""The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.""

It was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of “we’re going to win the league” echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, “This Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.”

But the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.

“You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

""Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn’t matter,"" says Jenkins.

""Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. 'You’ll Never Walk Alone' is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent. It’s not just about Liverpool people, it’s about people generally.

""If we didn’t win the league because it was voided, that would be unfair but not a disaster. The real wait is for when we can all go to the match again. That wait is more painful than whether we win the league or not."""
91,,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/06/sport/newcastle-united-takeover-billionaire-investment-european-football/,How billionaire owners changed European football,"Global Investment How billionaire owners changed European football

(CNN) — European football is no stranger to billionaire owners, and the latest deep-pocketed investor to show interest in acquiring a team stirred the English Premier League as it lay dormant during the coronavirus lockdown.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is part of a three-party consortium attempting to buy Newcastle United. The other partners are PCP Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity company run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, and private equity and real estate firm Reuben Brothers.

For Newcastle fans, the proposed takeover heralds overdue change.

After 13 years under the ownership of Mike Ashley, the British businessman who runs retail brand Sports Direct, the feeling is that the club has been starved of investment for too long.

Newcastle, a powerful force in English football during the 1990s, suffered two relegations under Ashley’s tenure. The decision to temporarily rename the club stadium to The Sports Direct Arena in 2011 was also met with fan resentment.

Hostility to the Ashley regime probably explains why a survey by the Newcastle United Supporters Trust in April found that 96.7% of the more than 3,397 fans questioned were in favor of the new ownership group, which is being fronted by PCP.

The hope is that the new owners can inject more money into the club and propel Newcastle back to the top of English football.

The takeover has been rumbling on for months with other investors reportedly interested in buying the club. Before a takeover goes through, any successful bid must pass English football’s Owners’ and Directors’ test.

“If the fans have faith in the owners then that builds trust and trust builds time,” Kieran Maguire, a university lecturer on football finance and author of The Price of Football, tells CNN Sport.

“If it was me [as a new owner], the focus would be to have a strategy, have a director of football who can therefore say, ‘This is the way that Newcastle United is going to go forwards, this is going to be our style of play in conjunction with the manager.’

“It’s the dull stuff, it’s the back office, the business operations that I would address first. Fans are looking for a marquee signing [but] I would say that just signing for the sake of signing is a way to waste money.”

Chelsea and Manchester City set the trend for courting big-name signings following takeovers by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mansour respectively.

The Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), in particular, was quick to throw money at City. Maguire says the club spent £62 million ($77 million) on transfers in 2008, the summer after Sheikh Mansour took charge, which included breaking the British transfer record in the purchase of Brazilian forward Robinho.

That was about 12 times what the club had spent the previous year, and City’s outgoings on players only grew in the years that followed.

Two seasons later, the likes of David Silva, Yaya Touré, Mario Balotelli and Edin Džeko were all brought in as, according to Maguire, £165 million ($204 million) was splashed on transfers in 2011; the season after that came Sergio Aguero, who helped deliver City its first league title for more than 40 years in dramatic fashion.

“It is known that wealthier clubs are more successful over the long term than their rivals with fewer resources,” Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at data company Gracenote, tells CNN Sport.

“When the current owners took full control in 2008, Manchester City were outside the top 20 richest clubs, and not amongst England's six wealthiest teams.

“The investment made by the owners made Manchester City competitive in the transfer market with the top English clubs, improving the team to the point that they could regularly challenge for trophies.”

In comparison to other English top-flight teams, Mike Ashley’s limited investment in Newcastle has seen the club twice drop into the Championship and seldom finish in the Premier League's top half. Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi owners invested heavily in player signings after taking over the club in 2008. Four Premier League titles have been won since, though the Champions League trophy has proved elusive. The dominant force in French football, PSG has failed to top Ligue 1 only twice since the Qatari owners bought the club. Much like City, PSG's domestic hegemony hasn't translated into European success.

Gleave also notes that City was rated the 68th best team in Europe when ADUG took over according to Gracenote’s Euro Club Index, which ranks all European football clubs based on competition results over a four-year period.

The club has risen up the pecking order under a number of different managers since then, before acquiring the top spot under Pep Guardiola in 2019.

Today, the chances of Newcastle matching the sort of spending that propelled City to success are remote given the restrictions football clubs must adhere to.

In the Premier League, a club can make losses of up to $130 million over three seasons and $33 million over three years for UEFA competitions. On Thursday, UEFA eased its regulations for one year due to Covid-19.

The latter’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations won’t immediately apply to Newcastle, but the club will need to be compliant if it wishes to compete in Europe in the near future as UEFA’s checks date back three years.

“If you take a look at both Manchester City and Chelsea when they were acquired by Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich, the initial transfer policy was scattergun and it was very hit and miss,” says Maguire.

“The advantage that both Chelsea and Manchester City had was that both clubs were operating in the pre-Financial Fair Play environment.

“Although I think Newcastle [might] have opportunity to spend more money than they have historically, they can’t just spend £100 million ($124 million) and write it off as easily as Chelsea and Manchester City were able to do back in the pre-Financial Fair Play days.”

Money spent on stadium infrastructure, a club’s academy, its women’s team, or community projects falls outside spending restrictions. City’s Abu Dhabi owners have been able to invest in a state-of-the-art academy stadium and training facilities around the Etihad Stadium.

“Like any new owners coming in, it'll be important that [Newcastle] have got the right people to give them the right advice to make sure they're spending their money as cleverly as possible … to maximize every pound that they are going to invest in,” sports lawyer Daniel Geey tells CNN Sport.

“Anyone expecting owners to come in even with very deep pockets and to spend like, for example, Roman Abramovich did, or Sheikh Mansour has done with Manchester City – I think those days are a little bit behind the Premier League.”

“In the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially.” Kieran Maguire

Newcastle may also benefit from Ashley’s frugal ownership if the new consortium purchases the club.

“If he’d been fairly loose with the cash, it could be that the new owners would inherit a club where they could only go and spend an extra £20 million ($24.5 million) next season because the losses from the last couple of years were so high,” explains Maguire.

“But in the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially. Which means of that £105 million ($130 million) loss, all of that is practically available to the new owners immediately.”

Overspending does have consequences. City has been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons for contravening FFP rules, although the club has called the charges “entirely false” and is appealing the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is due to announce its decision on City’s appeal in early July.

Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the president of French side Paris Saint-Germain, which is owned by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), has also been investigated by UEFA for illegal spending.

PSG has won the Ligue 1 title seven times since QSI took control of the club in 2011.

It smashed the transfer record by signing Neymar Jr. for $263 million from Barcelona in 2017, the same window that Kylian Mbappe also joined from AS Monaco.

An investigation launched in September 2017 to determine whether PSG had contravened FFP regulations was concluded last year when CAS upheld PSG’s appeal against the case.

Notably, for all their domestic success, neither City nor PSG have attained the same heights in Europe.

City lost to English rivals Liverpool and Tottenham in the final eight of the past two seasons, while PSG has fallen in the round of 16 in the past three campaigns, never reaching the semifinals under the Qatari owners.

But there’s little doubt that long term investment in a football club can yield returns, particularly in England’s top-flight league.

City is today part of City Football Group (CFG), a global network of associated clubs which includes teams in the United States, Australia, Japan and Uruguay.

Originally owned solely by ADUG, the China Media Capital consortium bought a 13% stake for $400 million in December 2015, while US private equity giant Silver Lake acquired just over 10% of CFG for $500 million last year.

“The Manchester City model, which is to buy lots of clubs around the world, is proving to be of benefit to them,” says Maguire.

“Very much the case at present is that Manchester City is the mothership and if they identify a good player in Spain or Uruguay or Australia or New York or wherever, that individual could then potentially be acquired by Manchester City at a very reasonable fee at a later point in time.

“It is a good strategy and I think it will reap its rewards in due course.”

Of course, the Abu Dhabi owners are 12 years down the line with City. The Newcastle deal is yet to be processed and has come under intense scrutiny since news of the potential ownership change surfaced.

Human rights group Amnesty argued that Saudi Arabia’s interest in Newcastle serves as “a PR tool to distract from the country's abysmal human rights record,"" while Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of late journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said the takeover would “stain” the Premier League.

Last month, Khashoggi’s children publicly forgave their father's killers, sparing five government agents the death penalty. The CIA concluded in 2018 that bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi's murder, which the crown prince denies.

Qatari-based media giant beIN Media Group has also voiced concerns about the proposed takeover given Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in illegally streaming football matches.

BeIN CEO Yousef Al-Obaidly wrote to the Premier League, alluding to the ""direct role"" Saudi Arabia has had in the ""launch, promotion and operation"" of alleged pirate streaming service beoutQ.

Earlier this week, the World Trade Organization ruled that Saudi Arabia had acted unlawfully in relation to beoutQ's operation, a decision that was welcomed by UEFA.

Under Premier League rules, owners of clubs can be disqualified if they don’t pass the Owners’ and Directors’ test before acquiring a club.

Both Newcastle and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by CNN in relation to the takeover.

The PIF and Saudi officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the takeover and criticism from Amnesty and Cengiz, while the Saudi Ministry of Media did not respond to the piracy claims.

Whether the new consortium will successfully purchase Newcastle hangs in the balance.

If the deal goes through, there will be an expectation the Magpies punch above their mid-table performances of recent seasons. But given the competitive nature of the Premier League, success is unlikely to come quickly or easily.

“I think the new owners will be able to bridge that gap [with the league’s top teams], but part of the reason that gap exists is because the other clubs are global brands,” says Maguire.

“It will take time for Newcastle to expand their influence on a more global sphere. But if they can qualify for Europe on a couple of occasions then they will become Saudi Arabia’s local club, as it were.”"
92,,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/01/sport/russian-climbers-peak-lenin-spt-intl/,Peak Lenin: Climbing disaster showcased bravery and pioneering spirit of Soviet women climbers.,"Frozen in Time Forty five years ago, eight Soviet women climbers were pinned on top of a high mountain in the USSR in the worst storm in 25 years.

It was June 1974. The Cold War was verging on détente, though the Watergate scandal overshadowed the Moscow Summit between President Richard Nixon and his Soviet Union counterpart, Leonid Brezhnev.

A month later, thousands of miles away in Central Asia, close to the Himalayas in the shadow of Peak Lenin, another meeting took place between an American and a Russian.

Soviet Union Iran India China Soviet Union Iran Saudi Arabia India China Mongolia The map reflects modern-day geography; the Soviet Union border is based on the borders of the countries that were part of the USSR. Map credits: maps4news.com/©OSM, Encyclopedia Britannica In 1974, 170 climbers from a number of countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp in the southern part of the Soviet Union, on the border of what is now Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. They camped in the Pamir Mountains, or Pamirs, a range with some of the world's highest mountains. Many would climb or attempt the 7,134 meter (23,406ft) Peak Lenin. While not considered steep or technical, it is high and subject to severe weather.







Molly Higgins first saw Elvira Shatayeva as she came around a bend in the High Pamirs mountain range, sometimes known as “the roof of the world.”

An Outward Bound instructor traveling the Colorado Rockies, living out of a faded white sedan, Higgins had been asked to a month-long international mountaineering gathering hosted by the Russians.

Nineteen Americans, including two women, attended as part of the 1974 American Pamirs / USSR Expedition. Higgins, then 24, was a last-minute invitee when organizers, many unsure or uneasy about quite where women fit in on expeditions, realized that one woman did not seem like enough.

""I was ambitious and very self-confident, and I thought I was very strong,” recalls Higgins, now a clinical laboratory scientist in Whitefish, Montana.

She was with a crew carrying loads up to Camp II -- Crevasse Camp -- toward Krylenko Pass on the shoulder of Peak Lenin, the country’s second-highest mountain, when an earthquake shook the slopes.

Higgins remembers a creaking sound. Then an avalanche roared overhead, launching off the top of an ice tower above camp.

The avalanche darkened the air, scattered gear, and partially buried one person, with at least two others jumping into the crevasse to escape. Four among the crew had descended earlier to resupply, and for hours those in both groups dreaded that the others had died.

Yet all had survived, though in the lower group Allen Steck, a pioneering climber from Berkeley, California, was buried up to his neck. The two groups joyfully reunited at Camp 1, on the Krylenko moraine, and retreated, shaken, to base camp in an alpine meadow.

Some 170 climbers from 10 Western countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp, with another 60 Eastern European and Russian climbers and officials across a stream.

This was the first major American expedition allowed in the Soviet Union, which has some of the highest and most remote mountains in the world. The gathering was held to showcase the region and the skills of the host climbers and, it seemed, develop relationships with Cold War rivals. It was seen as a means to bring up young mountaineers and foster mountaineering relations between countries.

Meet the climbers

No one could ever have imagined how many things would go wrong that summer, events rained down by the skies and upthrust by the earth, nor the heroics that would ensue.

Yet the story of one of the greatest disasters in all of mountaineering has been almost completely lost.

Even many non-climbers know of Everest disasters and who Alex Honnold is. Yet almost no one today, climbers included, has ever heard about what befell eight Russian women in 1974. A Google search turns up nothing about the 45th anniversary last year.

“He is injured!”

Describing the retreat after the calamitous avalanche, Higgins says: “We came down through these huge boulders, around a corner, and there, standing up, was this absolutely gorgeous, bright-blue-eyed, muscular, bossy hottie on a boulder, and she’s got about four Russian guys around her, and she’s ordering them around.” The woman was in her mid-30s.

Spotting that an American, Mike Yokell, was limping -- after jumping into the crevasse beside Camp II to escape the avalanche -- Shatayeva called out, “He is injured! Take his pack!”

Shatayeva then wheeled around, looked at Higgins, and said in deep, careful tones, “I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

“I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

Master of Sport was the top credential in any sport in the status-aware Soviet Union, even more impressive when attained by a woman.

Higgins recalls: “I thought it was great. I didn’t want to be bossy like that, but here was a woman who really was capable. I wanted to be like her, that strong and that experienced. She was a heroine, right there.”

In an era of relatively few women climbers, Higgins had never met one who was the kind of climber and mountaineer she wanted to be. It was to be the young American’s only interaction with Elvira.

“I knew right then that it was a transforming moment.”

Awkward dynamic

Arlene Blum, a biophysical chemist and environmentalist from Berkeley, California, had applied to the American Alpine Club to join the American contingent, but was declined.

However, some Swiss climbers, through an international women’s climbing club, brought her in on their invitation to be part of a women’s team. The situation created an awkward dynamic when Blum, 29, arrived in the Pamirs and entered the jam-packed mess tent.

As she told the story in her memoir “Breaking Trail,” she approached the crowded American table, but was ignored.

She wrote, “I stood amid the roar of voices, holding my bread and caviar and wishing I could disappear. Blessedly, a striking blonde Russian woman waved me over to her table.”

Shatayeva introduced herself and welcomed Blum. As they talked, she told Blum that most Soviet men thought a women’s team would never succeed on the 23,406-foot Peak Lenin — her group’s aim.

“We plan to be the first women’s team to do it,” said Shatayeva. “Or maybe your group will be.”

Blum, put at ease, said, “Maybe we could all climb together.”

“That is impossible” was the swift reply. Blum could only surmise that the Soviets wanted the first women’s team to be their own. Shatayeva told Blum the larger plan: that the eight women would climb the peak by the Lipkin Ridge on the northeast side and descend the northwest ridge toward the smaller Razdelny Peak. Theirs would be the first traverse, by men or women, of the peak. They were to bivouac, or make a temporary camp, on top.

“Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.” Elvira Shatayeva, July 15, 1974.

“We will succeed,” she told Blum. “Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.”

Blum today recalls Shatayeva’s “warmth and energy.”

“We shared a common goal of giving women the chance to climb high mountains and were so happy to be in this camp with other climbers who shared our delight in the mountains,” Blum reminisces.

She remembers feeling some concern about the ambitious plan to traverse Peak Lenin.

“This was in the days of the Cold War, when we were in competition with the Russians. I looked at their inadequate tents with button closures and [their] old-fashioned boots and thought how the Russian technology seemed to be going more into space than the mountains.”

“Cat-like blue eyes”

Christopher Wren, a climber and Moscow correspondent for the New York Times (he was to become bureau chief in December of that year), met Shatayeva in base camp early in the meet, which commenced in mid-July.

A passage (later anthologized) from his book “The End of the Line,” about his years in Russia and China, read: “A striking blonde with high cheekbones and cat-like blue eyes, she had come there to lead a team of the Soviet Union’s best women climbers in an assault on Lenin Peak.” Chatting with her over tea, he sensed a “steel core” beneath the surface.

The next time Wren saw Shatayeva was as he and two friends approached the top of Peak Lenin after a storm-blasted, two-night bivouac 1,000 feet below the summit, and spotted a splash of color, a blue jacket in a snow hollow.

“Someone,” he would write of that confused first impression, “seemed to be lying asleep in the bright sunshine.” He thought, An odd time for a nap.

Disciplined unit

Robert “Bob” Craig (who died in 2015, at 90), deputy leader for the American team and author of the subsequent expedition book, “Storm and Sorrow,” wrote: “For the most part, the women remained across the creek in the ‘Soviet Nationalities’ camp. They made several practice climbs, and we observed them a couple of times doing calisthenics in front of their tents.”

The women, whom he described as aged 22 to 35, appeared to be “very serious … still they sang songs together, and not infrequently we would hear their excited chattering and their laughter tinkling like bells across the valley.”

Elvira’s husband, Vladimir Shatayev, later wrote in his memoir, “Degrees of Difficulty,” that the women operated as a disciplined yet congenial unit. “Not once did we hear words of argument or contention.”

She told him, “You should read the minutes” of their meetings. “You men have never dreamed of such openness.”

Shatayeva had already organized the first all-women’s ascent of a 7,000-meter peak — Peak Korzhenevskaya (7,105 meters) -- in Tajikistan in 1972, and led a traverse of the double-summitted Ushba (4,710 meters) in Georgia the following year.

Two nights before the women set out, the American climbers Jed Williamson and Peter Lev strolled over to their camp to say hello and good luck. In a country of regulations, as Williamson, now a retired college president living in Hanover, New Hampshire, says, “It was the first time they were allowed to go without the company of men.” Four of the women had climbed Peak Lenin with males.

Dire natural circumstances

But no one could control weather or geology. The whole Pamirs meet was plagued by snow, rapidly developing avalanche hazard, an earthquake that shook avalanches down (with two more quakes later), and the worst storm seen in the region in 25 years.

At 1:00 a.m. on July 26, barely more than a day after Higgins and her group returned from Krylenko Pass, four climbers forging a new route on the north face of Peak of the 19th Party Congress (or Peak 19) were hit by an avalanche as they slept. Craig, the deputy leader for the American team, and his tent mate, Jon Gary Ullin, were buried. Ullin, 31, an affable and humorous airline pilot from Seattle, was crushed.

Their friends John Roskelley and John Marts had excavated both and tried to resuscitate Ullin when yet another avalanche hit, enveloping Craig again and sweeping away the tents and equipment.

Roskelley, Marts and Craig were then stranded in a snow cave for two days and dropped supplies in a superb collaborative helicopter rescue effort by the Soviets, who allowed Lev a key role as “drop person,” in which he had experience.

Lev, an avalanche forecaster and heli-ski guide, recalls the Russian helicopter being extremely powerful. “I was in the large open door, just hanging onto something,” he says, “and was able to get the drop ‘on their doorstep’” from about 50 or 75 feet above.

“The pilot deserves real credit.”

Five climbers who were not part of the meet and known to visitors only as “the Estonians” went missing on the East Face of Peak Lenin. Three were found to have died in an avalanche, and the other two were rescued and survived. Many accounts incorrectly say all five died.

For most in the assemblage, objectives changed in accordance with the conditions; although Roskelley and Jeff Lowe returned and completed the line up Peak 19, other climbers converged on the “standard” routes.

Meanwhile Higgins, while feeling lonely and isolated among the mostly male contingent, ended up in a group of four (herself; the expedition leader, Pete Schoening; Chris Kopczynski; and Frank Sarnquist) that climbed Peak Lenin via the Razdelny ridge on August 3.

The other American woman on the meet, the much-respected Marty Hoey -- who tragically died on Everest eight years later – also climbed the Razdelny side, with Lev, Bruce Carson and John Evans on August 4. Williamson started with them but, feeling ill, turned back.

While the mountain is not considered steep or technical, it is big and high and beset by challenging weather conditions, with sections of moderately steep ice, especially high on the Lipkin side.

Elvira Shatayeva and the Russian women made final preparations for Peak Lenin climb. July 30 - The Russian women’s team left Base Camp for Camp I. July 31 - The team took the Lipkin route and proceeded toward the summit without any problems. On August 3, Shatayeva called a rest day. August 3 – An American team of climbers behind the Russian women reported: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions.” August 4 - A major storm was forecast, and organizers recommended all climbers descend. The Russian women were seen walking in a line perhaps 400 feet below the summit. August 5 - The Russian women’s team radioed from the summit. August 6 - The women tried to descend but only managed a few hundred feet. Speaking to base then and August 7, they reported their struggles. Their final transmission came through at 20:30. August 8 - The storm was over. From their final camp, located about 400 meters below the summit, the American team set out for the summit with no idea of the events that had occurred above.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it,” Higgins says. “The altitude … I did some collapsing. It was a really humbling experience. I was very proud of it and so glad it was done.”

Jeff Lowe, a standout young climber (who died of natural causes in 2018), would much later post in an online thread: “[S]ome of the guys on the trip gave her a hard time, claiming she didn't have enough [expedition or alpine] experience to be there. Molly proved them wrong, though -- pulling her own weight and generally comporting herself in a competent manner.”

On August 3, Steck moved up on the Lipkin side with Wren and Jock Glidden. Steck wrote in his diary, as reported in his 2017 memoir, “A Mountaineer’s Life”: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions. Our altimeter tells us we are at about 5,800 meters,” or 19,030 feet. On August 4, the three took a layover day.

The Americans’ radios had been impounded in customs, so Steck’s group had only a weak radio on loan from the Soviets, and all countries had been put on different frequencies. That day, a major storm was forecast, and Vitaly Abalakov -- Master of Sport for mountaineering in the whole country (who died in 1986) -- recommended that all climbers descend to base. Steck’s group never received the message, nor did Richard Alan North of Scotland.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it.” Molly Higgins, May 5, 2019.

From July 31 to August 3, North, a biomedical scientist now retired and living in Niwot, Colorado, and teammates moved up a “new though not particularly difficult” route to join the Lipkin route.

On August 4, by then climbing alone, North cut steps, as was commonly done in the era, in the steepening ice -- tedious, tiring work accompanied by altitude-induced hallucinations. He reached the top and then descended, slipping a few times and gripping his ice axe for self-arrest on the hard snow. At the foot of the steep section, perhaps 400 feet below the summit, he met the Russian women, walking in a line.

It was windy, with visibility “just a few meters,” he says.

They exchanged greetings, and North was later to recreate the scene in Summit magazine, writing: “They are moving slowly up but in high spirits.

“‘You get a bit short of breath up there,’ I remark jokingly. But the humor is lost on them.

“‘Ah! We are strong. We are women,’ they reply.”

North descended, passing some Soviet men who summited behind him and later joined his descent.

He believes the women climbed the steep icy section and camped that night on the eastern edge of the summit ridge, before moving to the summit the next day.

On the morning of August 5, on the somewhat more straightforward Razdelny side, a Soviet climber came to Blum’s tent at Camp III, the top camp, with a message from base saying, “A storm is predicted. Do not try to climb.”

Still, the air remained calm and fairly clear, people had come a long way and were in position, and some chose to try. Blum, Heidi Lüdi and Eva Isenschmid of Switzerland started up, though the latter two carried extra gear and planned on a possible bivouac, so Blum hastened ahead, with a turnaround time in mind and hoping to beat any weather.

Nearing the top when the storm hit shortly before noon, Blum retreated, soon fighting the wind and blizzard. She was fortunately joined by Williamson, who had started up for the summit again, also with a firm turnaround limit and an eye on the weather. He had retreated from very high -- the summit plateau at 22,800 feet.

Williamson broke trail and urged Blum on when she sat, exhausted. On the way down the pair saw Blum’s two teammates and a Bavarian woman friend and entreated them to descend as well; Isenschmid, a 23-year-old photographer and artist whom North calls a “gentle soul,” was to die in the storm the next day despite strenuous rescue efforts from her partners and French, German and American climbers.

Meanwhile, Steck, Wren and Glidden hiked up to just below the major ridge and in wild storm conditions stopped and camped at 22,000 feet, their Camp IV, the final one.

The Soviet women’s team summitted late afternoon on August 5, carrying full loads (climbers not on a traverse can leave some gear below). At 5:00 p.m. they radioed base camp and said that in the deteriorating visibility they were having difficulty making out the descent and had set up their tents to wait for a break.

Accounts of the ensuing events differ, but Vladimir Shatayev in his book notes that base camp agreed, saying to descend immediately if possible or wait the night. Craig’s book reports that Abalakov told them to descend first thing in the morning on the Lipkin, the route they had ascended and knew.

That night Steck’s group wore their boots and all clothing to bed in case their tent shredded. The Americans had nylon tents with zippers and aluminum poles. Holding up the tent poles, though one snapped, they would outlast the storm. The Soviet women had cotton tents with toggle closures and wooden poles, and according to Craig the wind wrecked two tents the first night.

The morning of August 6 brought five inches of snow at base and, higher, a foot of snow and winds of 70 to 80 mph. Climbers gathered to hear radio transmissions by translator as Shatayeva radioed reports of the sustained whiteout and worsening wind.

At what Vladimir Shatayev states as 5:00 p.m. (though Craig indicates as some hours earlier), Shatayeva reported that one woman had become ill and another seemed unwell. Abalakov told them to descend.

Abalakov spoke slowly and adamantly, according to Craig, saying to reach snow in which they could dig caves.

Craig wrote, “[I]t was implied that if the sick girl could not move and they could not achieve adequate shelter, they must leave her for the good of the group as a whole.”

As the women descended, Irina Lyubimtseva died, apparently freezing to death holding a safety rope for others.

Unable to dig caves in the hard, granular snow, the women somehow managed to put up two tents on a ridge only several hundred feet below the top. The ailing climbers deteriorated. Abalakov strongly directed continued descent by those who could move, according to Craig; Shatayeva said she understood and would try.

The times given vary, but that day or into the next, the ill women (Nina Vasilyeva and Valenina Fateyeva) died. Also that day or, by Shatayev’s account in the early hours after midnight, hurricane-force winds hit, exploding the tents and blowing away rucksacks, stoves and mittens. Five women huddled in a tent without poles, with three sleeping bags.

The next morning four Japanese climbers, bivouacked in a tent at 6,500 meters on the Lipkin side and possessing a strong radio, heard the transmissions in Russian and deduced trouble. Two of the Japanese climbers bravely set out to help but were blown off their feet and forced back. Other climbers on the mountain mobilized, but all were far lower.

Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye. When will we see the flowers again?

The final hours

The following excerpts are from Craig. Accounts and times differ somewhat, but Craig was in base camp and overall his account is considered sound, and an honest, earnest rendition.

August 7, “about” 08:00. Abalakov pressed Shatayeva as to whether the women were trying to descend. She replied with spirit: “Three more are sick; now there are only two of us who are functioning, and we are getting weaker. We cannot, we would not leave our comrades after all they have done for us.”

10:00 Shatayeva: “It is very sad here where it was once so beautiful.”

Noon. One more had died, two were dying. “They are all gone now. That last asked, ‘When will we see the flowers again?’ [Two] others earlier asked about [their] children. Now it is no use.”

15:30 [Disoriented] “We are sorry, we have failed you. We tried so hard. Now we are so cold.”

Abalakov in despair promised a rescue was underway.

17:00 Transmission unclear, but another woman seemed to have died. Three remained. Winds up high were estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the summit temperatures as minus 30 to minus 40 F.

18:30 “Another has died. We cannot go through another night. I do not have the strength to hold down the transmitter button.”

20:30 “Now we are two. And now we will all die. We are very sorry. We tried but we could not … Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye.”

Vladimir Shatayev’s book identifies the last speaker not as his wife but Galina Perehodyuk, and suggests it was difficult to understand whether the word was “forgive” or “request.” He writes that twice more someone pressed the radio button, attempting contact with the world.

Steck says, “The events of that day are permanently etched into my brain.” On August 8 the American trio, unprepared, saw the first body on the face below the summit; Wren recognized Shatayeva. Signs of others were visible upslope. The four Japanese arrived at the same time, and the Americans borrowed their radio to call base, with Steck saying, “Something very strange, very sad has happened here.” Finding the other bodies above, they walked crying among them, amid the shreds of tent fabric and shards of poles.

Beyond Shatayeva, two women were half-buried in the snow; three, as Wren was to write in the New York Times, “sprawled across a torn tent, futilely pitched on a scooped‐out snow platform,” and another was frozen holding a rope leading downhill. The eighth was to be found beneath the others when Elvira’s husband and a support crew went up a week later to retrieve them.

That night at camp all three Americans were certain they heard women’s voices. “Russian voices,” says Steck. “We'd open the tent and no one was there.”

The reasons for the mass tragedy are many, sifted through with the benefit of hindsight.

The objective, as a traverse, put the women as camping on the summit, exposed to the worst of the storm. They had poor equipment. They were also under pressure, on show.

“They were the test group,” says Higgins. “They felt they needed to do it to uphold the standards of the women’s team.”

Wren wrote, “Rather than retreat when the storm came in, they made a miscalculation to wait until the visibility improved. I suspect that they did not want foreigners to think Russians were quitters.”

Many observed that Shatayeva felt great responsibility for her team.

Says Blum: “The women were so very loyal to each other. They stayed together until the end.”

Higgins expresses regret, respect and conflicting feelings over the series of events.

“Would it have been braver to say, ‘Let’s save the five of us?’... I just think it was really sad. I’ve felt,” she says honestly, “that she should have taken who she could and gotten out of there.

“It is huge,” she says feelingly of such a quandary. “It is a mortal decision.”

North, the last person to see the women alive (some accounts mistakenly have Scottish and Japanese climbers on the summit with them), says, “You could call them victims of circumstance.

“I don’t think without the international meet they would have been in that situation, in that weather. Same with Eva and Heidi. Because there were so many nations taking part and the overall world situation at that time, it was unusual to be there, so there was a bit of an element of people wanting to represent their nations that does not exist in normal mountaineering situations.”

John Evans (who has just died, January 9), in a published journal, “The Pamirs: Russia,” called the many fatalities “an extraordinarily sorrowful statistic … made even more distressing in the light of the very optimistic and positive intentions of our Russian hosts.” Thirteen were lost: the three Estonians, Jon Gary Ullin, Eva Isenschmid and the eight Russian women.

Anguished and noble

Williamson, in Camp III on Razdelny during the storm, says: “They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration. I’m just sad those conditions came together. The storm came in pretty fast and went fast. Two days later it was bluebird skies, and we were in shirtsleeves.”

The crucial decision was the one to stay on the summit. Still, a major turning point may have occurred days earlier, in that era when women climbers were often doubted and excluded.

On Peak Lenin, Shatayeva had at first welcomed the snow, on August 4 telling Vladimir by radio, “That’s good—it covers the tracks. So that there won’t be talk that we ascended along a trail” made by others.

Nearing the main ridge August 2, Shatayeva had radioed, “Everything so far is so good that we’re disappointed in the route.”

Yet August 3 she called a rest day. Three teams of Soviet men, one of which summitted August 4, were near, clearly coordinated to provide support if needed. Vladimir Shatayev wrote, “The possibility cannot be ruled out that it was precisely for this reason that the women were dragging out the climb, trying to break loose from the guardianship.”

Had they reached the top one day earlier, they would have been lower when the storm hit.

“They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration.” Jed Williamson, June 23, 2019.

Now, 45 years on, women have long proved themselves in climbing and mountaineering, are widely visible on the crags and in the peaks, and accepted as peers.

The tale of the Russian women climbers is, as Higgins puts it, “one of the epic sad stories in modern climbing history.”

During the meet, different countries worked together in disastrous and even surreal circumstances. Other people had known the Russian women to be, as Blum put it in her book, “jubilant” on the mountain, and then witnessed an anguished and noble end.

“It is so enormously tragic, occurring at a time when more women were beginning to brave great challenges on rock and in mountains,” Higgins says. ""I wanted to be one of those women, and Elvira seemed invincible.”

""Pretty standard procedure,"" says the athlete who has experienced a far from ordinary 12 months.

Until last March, Harris was admired by many yet not widely recognized. As a young player in the women's Australian Football League (AFLW), a summer sport that is an Australian obsession, her focus had been on flourishing professionally in two sports -- on making a name for herself on the football field and, during the off season, in the boxing ring, too.

But a picture posted on Facebook last year of Harris playing for her team Carlton Blues elevated the then 21-year-old beyond the world of sport. She became one of the most talked-about sportswomen on the planet.

First came the vile messages, and they came thick and fast -- sexist, disturbing and damaging comments posted below a now iconic picture of Harris doing her job.

Harris' fearless response was then shared by thousands on social media, prompting celebrities, and even Australia's Prime Minister, to voice their support. She had stood up and spoken out. It changed her world.

""I would be happy to go through it all again, but I'd rather not,"" says Harris.

With one tweet Harris had made a lasting impression in the usually transitory world of social media, while the photograph is now a symbol of defiance. T-shirts with her silhouette can be bought and a bronze statue of her was unveiled on Australian Women's Day in September.

""I love it when a mum or a young daughter and son says to me 'thanks for standing up to what you stood up for,'"" Harris tells CNN Sport.

""If my example is going to help someone in any way, I would be happy to go through it all again. I'd rather not, but there's been so many amazing messages. It's been an eye-opening experience.""

'Here's a picture of me at work'

It is the opening minutes of the AFLW's Pride Game between the Western Bulldogs and Carlton on March 17, 2019, and Harris, the Blues' forward, has kicked the first goal of the game.

Photographer Michael Willson has brilliantly captured the athleticism of the act: she is mid-air, looking to her left, focusing on the trajectory of a ball which is out of shot. So gymnastically high is her right leg, her right foot is above her head. While a few feet from the ground, she is almost doing the splits.

What followed is said to have changed the landscape of women's sport in Australia.

Posting the picture on its 7AFL Facebook page, Australian broadcaster Channel 7 captions it ""photo of the year.""

Here's a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj — Tayla Harris (@taylaharriss) March 19, 2019

Few could have foreseen that the number of, in the broadcaster's words, ""inappropriate and offensive"" comments would lead to Channel 7 deleting the post 24 hours later because, it said, the messages had become difficult to monitor.

But erasing a picture that showcased the prowess of the women's game caused more damage. After all, such an act does not silence trolls.

""THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE PHOTO,"" tweeted Sam Kerr, one of the world's best female soccer players, echoing the thoughts of many. A few hours later, the hashtag ""Tayla"" was trending on Twitter.

At the time, Harris was at home getting ready for bed, ""just doing my thing,"" she says, when her phone started pinging. One notification rapidly following another.

""I didn't think 'oh, this is a really personal attack,"" Harris explains. ""I just thought, obviously this is a much bigger issue than just saying sexist things to people. It's actually the start of something much worse.""

After a phone conversation with the chief executive of a national project which aims to eliminate domestic and family violence, Harris proceeded to post a message which became the most liked tweet of 2019 in Australia.

""Here's a picture of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals,"" Harris wrote. The tweet remains pinned at the top of her profile page.

""When I saw a little picture on Facebook and I'd see a young girl with a man who has made these comments, it was horrifying to think that this girl had to live, or be around someone, who is able to actually say these things. I thought about it in depth,"" Harris continues.

""I responded after an hour or two. I thought 'I have the photo, so I'll just put it up and just chuck that caption on' and what happened, happened. I didn't put it up as a f**k you to Channel 7, I just put it up because I thought it was a cool photo.""

Harris speaks next to Carlton CEO Cain Liddle during a press conference at Ikon Park.

Harris went to bed with around 20,000 Twitter followers but by the next morning had an additional 60,000. There was an apology from Channel 7 for sending ""the wrong message"" by removing the photo from its social media accounts, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the trolls ""cowardly grubs.""

With a weekend match looming, Harris restricted herself to one radio interview in the immediate aftermath, during which she described the comments as sexual abuse, and held a press conference to sate the appetite of media organizations around the world. Carlton provided her with a security guard for the next game, against Fremantle.

""Surreal,"" and a ""roller-coaster"" is how she sums up the week. ""For the most part it was all positive,"" she adds, ""but I had to check in with myself and make sure this was something I was OK with because it was a really full on and busy, confronting few weeks.

""The really important thing for me was not to dilute the messaging or say something that could be misinterpreted, so I made sure I was really clear and articulate.""

To understand Harris' inner strength, we must step back in time, to the first decade of the century when the self-confessed daddy's girl was growing up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and towering above her elementary schoolmates. She would grow to become 5ft 10in.

Her father Warren, a marine mechanic whom Harris describes as her best friend, encouraged his daughter to partake in whatever activity she wanted -- skateboarding, building boats, self defense, Aussie Rules -- and with such freedom came confidence and, significantly, courage.

""If I see someone suffering or needing help, I'm already doing something before my brain even knows it,"" Harris says.

""That's something I always have done and always will do. It's non-negotiable for me.

""There was a boy at school who would always pick on a girl who used to be my best friend in grade four because she had a disability. I was a big kid, I was tall, so instead of saying something I would stand physically in the way but, at one point, this boy was relentless so I took him down and, apparently, I pushed him to the ground and held him down and then I found myself in the Principal's office.

""My dad remembers the Principal saying, 'Tayla can't be doing those things because that will hurt the boy's self-esteem.' Dad went off his head. My dad still tells that story, about how wrong that particular incident was.""

Such spirit helped Harris -- who played Aussie Rules with boys until she was told to stop aged 14 -- rise to an elite athlete in two sports. She is unbeaten in seven professional fight and holds the Australian middleweight crown.

Yet like most women in sport, Harris has had to develop a thick skin. She was accustomed to online abuse long before a picture of that kick was posted online.

Her decision to join the Blues from the Brisbane Lions in 2018 stoked keyboard rage but a ""lightbulb moment"" after a conversation with a close friend helped her ride it out.

""He said 'why do you care what someone who you've never met and will probably never meet and have never done anything for you in your life think' so, from that moment, I was like 'why do I care what that weird scummy guy is saying',"" says Harris, conceding that putting up with trolls is likely her lot in life, for the immediate future at least.

Harris has tweeted that she'd give up her AFLW wage to employ a person to monitor online abuse and has called on governing body the AFL to block people who make discriminatory comments from its social media accounts.

Speaking before the death of English television presenter Caroline Flack , which led to the #BeKind hashtag being used on social media, Harris adds: ""It's a pretty messed up online world.

""It's a generational issue. It'll be weeded out in a while when young people come through with the understanding that it's not acceptable to be doing these things.""

Harris (R) fights againt Janay Harding on November 22, 2019.

Her parents, Harris admits, struggle to stoically react to the abuse she continues to receive online.

""They live a plane trip away so (last year) was hard, especially for mum, especially when it was all unfolding as all she wanted to do was get on the plane and make sure I was alright,"" Harris says.

""And all dad wanted to do was go and pay a visit to the people who were making these comments and I guess the rest is best left unsaid.""

Even before that kick was immortalized in bronze in Melbourne's bustling Federation Square, Harris warned her mum not to go online.

""I said to her 'please don't read the comments that are going to be online' because I knew people wouldn't take the time to consider that this statue is about much more than just me,"" Harris says.

""Particular people who didn't take the time to understand what the statue meant were hellbent on saying I didn't deserve this statue. I know I don't deserve a statue as a footballer, but this scenario deserves a statue for a pivotal moment in time that has helped people.""

Harris will forever be known for that photograph, but though only 22 she is not burdened by the responsibility that comes with influence.

""I often get young people who have experienced bullying online messaging me and they've said specifically that I've been the one who's helped them actually call it out, or help their friends call it out,"" she says.

""Bullying online is so bad that young people are committing suicide, which is horrific, so if I can give someone confidence to feel a little bit better about themselves, I will do everything to do that because you just don't know what could've happened otherwise."""

Anti-Semitism ‘My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands... he had to dig the grave himself.’

(CNN) — Avram Grant remembers the screaming.

It came nearly 50 years ago when Grant, then a teenager, first fully began to grasp the horrors that his father, Meir, had been forced to endure during the Holocaust.

“When I was 15 years old, I was sitting on the balcony of my home with my friend and I heard screaming and shouting,” Grant, the former Chelsea coach, told CNN.

“I had never heard anything like this, not even in Hitchcock movies,” adds Grant, referring to the legendary filmmaker.

“It was a shock for me. My father was shouting, I will never forget it. I said to my mum: ‘Mum, what is happening?’ I saw she was very calm and she touched him and he went back to sleep.

“I remember this day because I took a decision to realize how from this hell came such an optimistic and happy guy. I am telling you that I will never forget it.”

In 1941, Grant’s father fled Nazi-occupied Poland at the age of 13 along with the rest of his family before being exiled in northern Russia, where temperatures plunged to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Only Meir and his brother survived.

“My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands … he had to dig the grave himself,” Grant said.

“He was 13. This was all because of hatred. That’s why I am always here to speak about it. Always.”

Grant is not only committed to telling his father’s story, but also to educating the next generation. That’s why he has embraced a campaign led by Chelsea, the club he once managed, aimed at eradicating anti-Semitism from soccer and society.

“When you get to my age, you realize there will be nobody left to tell the younger generation firsthand what happened. That’s why it is so important because we are coming to the end of the Holocaust survivor era.”

Grant’s reservations appear well placed.

Lack of Holocaust knowledge

The results of CNN’s 2018 investigation into anti-Semitism in Europe unearthed a number of shocking statistics on the subject of Holocaust education, with a third of Europeans in the poll saying they knew just a little or nothing at all about the Nazis systematic killing of six million Jews.

The outlook was similarly bleak in the US.

A survey carried out on behalf of the Claims Conference in 2018 found that 11% of American adults were not sure they’d ever heard of the Holocaust, rising to one in five millennials. Nearly half of the millennials surveyed could not name a single concentration camp, and 45% of the American adults questioned failed to do so.

In early May, Grant led a delegation from Chelsea and MLS team New England Revolution to take part in “March of the Living,” in which participants were taken on a guided tour of Auschwitz and learned about the systematic mass murder of Europe’s Jewish communities.

The visit was part of Chelsea’s highly respected “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign, which was launched in January 2018 under the leadership of club owner Roman Abramovich.

It was in November 2017 that Abramovich, who is Jewish, began discussions with the club’s board about a concerted campaign to fight anti-Semitism.

He was perturbed by the number of anti-Semitic incidents that had taken place across Europe and was eager to take a stand.

It was also an opportunity to educate the club’s supporters on a subject that those who watched the team in the 1970s and 1980s would have been all too aware of, given the anti-Semitic songs and chants that used to be heard at games.

Auschwitz chants

Ivor Baddiel, a Jewish Chelsea supporter, said he stopped attending games temporarily in the 1970s after hearing chants of “Sieg Heil” from a section of fellow supporters and seeing anti-Semitic literature sold outside the stadium.

Particularly vivid are his memories from games against Tottenham, one of Chelsea’s London rivals, that historically has a large following from the Jewish community.

Baddiel says Tottenham fans were often targeted by anti-Semitic abuse with songs such as “Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz” and hissing noises mimicking the sound of the gas chambers used by the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Baddiel also recalls the first time he heard the word “Yid,” a derogatory word for Jew, at a game. At the time, the word was also being used by Tottenham supporters, who wanted to reclaim the word from the racists, and instead, in their view, wear it as a badge of honor.

Even today, some Tottenham supporters refer to themselves as ‘“Yiddos” and the “Yid Army,” despite calls from Jewish groups to stop.

Though shocked by the nature of the anti-Semitic abuse, Baddiel, later resumed attending games.

He has made two videos on anti-Semitism, one focusing specifically on the “Y-word” and the other for Chelsea’s current campaign, both of which he hopes will help educate the public.

“Absurd as it sounds, those guys in the pub who are singing, ‘Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz,’ I think you could even question whether they realize they are being anti-Semitic,” Baddiel said.

“They think they’re being anti-Tottenham.

“I think a lot of people didn’t know it was a racist word for Jews and just thought it was about Tottenham fans.”

Fighting back

Today, Chelsea is one of the most proactive sporting organizations in tackling anti-Semitism, and its “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign has already won praise from both inside and outside football.

The club has taken supporters to Auschwitz-Birkenau to educate them about the horrors of the Holocaust, has invited survivors to speak to players and staff about their experiences, and is raising money to help fund a new Holocaust exhibition at London’s Imperial War Museum.

Neil Beard, a Chelsea supporter who attended his first game in 1970, believes the club has helped fans become better equipped to fight against anti-Semitism by providing educational programs and taking them on trips to concentration camps.

Beard, who visited Auschwitz last year with his two teenage children, and also attended a talk by a Holocaust survivor organized by the club in London, says the work Chelsea is doing is having a hugely positive effect.

“I feel we came back as advocates ready to tackle anti-Semitism, particularly where it’s done casually and through ignorance and people think it’s funny,” Beard told CNN.

“It’s not funny. We really need to take it seriously. It’s obviously a global issue with the rise of fascism but as Chelsea supporters and for the club I think we’ve come a long way because it’s now unacceptable and embarrassing among Chelsea supporters to sing some of the songs that were sung during the 1980s, 1990s and even up to today.

“Listening to a survivor had a huge impact on me, trying to imagine yourself in that position and that was harrowing to think you could have found yourself there in that kind of hell. It was so powerful.”

The Chelsea Foundation runs equality training workshops in 75 schools across the UK and ran sessions for hundreds of children in the lead-up to the team’s arrival in Boston for the club’s game against New England Revolution in a contest arranged to raise money for groups tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination.

Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman, insists that while instances of anti-Semitism at the club’s games remain a “very small problem but an important problem” compared to 30 years ago, there will be no letup in the fight against Jew hatred.

He cites the training of stewards in identifying anti-Semitic behavior and the use of CCTV as key aides in tracking down those responsible.

“We’ve come a long way, society has come a long way, but there’s still a problem and I don’t underestimate the problem,” Buck told CNN.

“We are only dealing with the overt incidents and not dealing with those behind the screen and that’s where the other aspect I think of our project, the education part, dealing with that, trying to deal with what’s below the surface.”

Chelsea has cracked down on instances of racism by its fans already this season. Four fans were suspended for appearing to racially abuse Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling last December, while three supporters were barred from entering a Europa League game against Slavia Prague after a video on social media allegedly showed them abusing Liverpool’s Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah.

“We all understand the power of football, the reach of football, it’s extraordinary,” Buck added. “As an American, we think of ourselves as the biggest sports fans in the world and maybe we are, but we don’t have the attachment to our club that you do in the UK which is cradle to grave, whichever club your father supports, you support, and it’s unique. I think it’s true in continental Europe too. So that attachment gives them a loyalty and gives us an opportunity to education.”

'Could take an entire generation to correct properly'

Chelsea’s work has already been commended by sections of the local Jewish Community as well as UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.

Mirvis believes the role of education, which Chelsea is keen to emphasize as part of its strategy, is key to tackling anti-Semitism though he concedes there is no quick fix. “It could take an entire generation to correct properly,” he told CNN of the fight against anti-Semitism.

“Chelsea is leading the field here and it’s huge congratulations to them. I think the most significant thing Chelsea has done is to acknowledge that there is a problem. That’s very much to their credit. They have taken some concrete and constructive steps.

“It’s an enormous challenge. I think education, the concept, needs to be repeated again and again, together with genuine attempts. Our problem is that we are playing catch up when we are dealing with adults who are already in the stadium. They’ve been conditioned to some degree by their society to think in a certain way and find certain elements of conduct within their comfort zone.”

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers.”

Karen Pollock, head of the Holocaust Educational Trust in London, told CNN it had been “humbling” to see Chelsea committing itself to fighting anti-Semitism with direction coming from the very top of the club and being embraced by staff and players alike.

“Footballers are role models for so many and their words and actions have such an impact,” Pollock said.

“Their positive message of inclusion and tolerance is vital in tackling prejudice and hate.”

Pittsburgh

For Chelsea, its arrival in the US could scarcely have been more timely.

An annual report published in May by the Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic incidents in the US remained near historic levels in 2018 after surging the previous year.

According to the latest figures from the ADL, 2018 was the third-highest year on record for assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews since it began tracking such incidents in 1979.

There were a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country, according to the report. This includes the 11 people killed during the October 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US.

These numbers are down slightly from the 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, the ADL said.

The decision to visit the US last month and hold a charity match against New England Revolution was made in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack. Both Abramovich and Revolution owner Robert Kraft had already expressed their desire to work with one another on tackling anti-Semitism, but according to Buck, Pittsburgh was the catalyst for the charity match.

Both Abramovich and Kraft pledged to donate $1 million to the charity fund, with a further $2 million being raised through gate receipts. The $4 million pot will be split between 15 different organizations tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination including the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

'Heroes'

Elan Carr, the US special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism, told CNN that while the attack in Pittsburgh and one at a synagogue in Poway, California, have recently left the Jewish community on edge, programs such as the one deployed by Chelsea and New England Revolution could play a key part in educating future generations on the dangers of anti-Semitism.

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers – and athletes are influencers in a way no one else can be. These guys are heroes to kids from rural farmlands to cities, they are adored and worshipped. To have athletes who are so influential stand up and fight for decency and justice, and take positions and say ‘no’ to this scourge of anti-Semitism, a human sickness, and for athletes to say that is unacceptable, that is a game changer,” Carr told CNN.

“This example of what is happening and what Chelsea and New England are doing is a model that can truly change the world,” he added.

'Big power'

Such a responsibility is not lost on the players. Born in Brazil to parents who both worked as teachers, defender David Luiz told CNN that the morals instilled in him during his childhood have helped him become more aware of discrimination within society.

“Football has big, big power to do it and we have to use it in the right way,” Luiz told CNN of the sport’s role in bringing about positive social change.

“I think we are examples for many people around the world and we have to use this power in the right way to make the real difference.

“If you go to the maternity unit you don’t see one baby with a bad vibe. The babies are good, they are cute. It’s the pollution of the world and the system that makes people think in different ways.”

Luiz was part of the squad that visited the New England Holocaust memorial in Boston and also took part in education workshops with local schoolchildren.

On the final day of the tour, he played a part in Chelsea’s 3-0 win at Gillette Stadium with 25,000 fans lending their support to the game dubbed “Final Whistle on Hate.”

Abramovich flew to Boston to watch the game alongside Kraft and visited the locker room afterward.

'I will keep speaking'

For Grant, it was the final event of a trip that had brought the scourge of anti-Semitism to the forefront of the sporting agenda and gave hope to those working to tackle it each and every day.

But what would his father, who passed away at the age of 82 in October 2009, say?

“You know, if my father was alive now he would say: ‘Why are you living in the past?’

“I would say to him that I’m not living in the past, I want to know about the past so that it will not happen again."
95,2019-05-04 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/sport/hoop-dreams-25th-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html,"NBA: ""Hoop Dreams"" basketball documentary still relevant in 25th year","(CNN) When Dwyane Wade was a 12-year-old shooting jumpers on the playgrounds of Chicago, a movie came out that would help navigate him through his future Hall of Fame career.

Released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" shadowed the bumpy fortunes of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two inner-city Chicago youths dreaming of NBA stardom.

Wade's path to the Final Four with Marquette and championships with the Miami Heat would be lined with the same challenges faced by Agee and Gates, including the pressures of injury and young parenting, and the avoidance of drugs and gun violence.

Twenty-five years since its premier, ""Hoop Dreams"" still impacts Wade. ""I watched it many times, and it resonated with me because we all have hoop dreams,"" the recently retired three-time NBA champion tells CNN.

""Growing up in Chicago you struggle,"" he adds, ""I look at ""Hoop Dreams"" and I can see myself in those individuals at the time.""

Film critics like the late Roger Ebert lauded the three-hour documentary f or exposing a side of America rarely depicted at the time: A class system stacked against the poor, coinciding with rising corruption in youth basketball.

Filmmakers Steve James (left), Peter Gilbert (center) and Fred Marx worked on a very thin budget until three years into ""Hoop Dreams,"" when they were able to secure enough funding for the project.

So what has changed since then?

College basketball is coming off a thrilling season, but faces intense scrutiny as a second corruption trial involving shady figures and illicit payments around the sport unravels in court. Meanwhile, Agee and Gates remain close -- bonded not just by their fame from ""Hoop Dreams,"" but two devastating murders in their families.

""You can't script this stuff,"" says Gates, 47, a youth basketball coach in San Antonio, Texas, to CNN. ""Our stories continue to (overlap) like that, because he lost Bo and we lost Curtis.""

Gates' brother Curtis, a former high school star who flamed out, and Agee's father Bo were both featured on screen. Curtis was shot in 2001, reportedly in a dispute over a woman, while Bo - whose redemption from crack addiction and jail time was a seminal part of the film - was killed in a robbery three years later.

""It was very heartbreaking,"" adds Agee, who still lives in the West Side of Chicago, not far from where he grew up. ""It's so eerie that me and William always say ""Hoop Dreams"" was a gift and a curse, and we both lost people that played a big part of our lives.

""And then for both of us not to make the NBA, you know, that eeriness, that gift and a curse is there.""

Though neither athlete played in the NBA, both received college scholarships -- no small feat coming from the dire housing projects they grew up in.

Agee, 46, who attended Arkansas State, went on to play professionally in the now-defunct USBL and had a stint with the Harlem Globetrotters. He then turned to acting, with small parts in a film and commercials.

Agee remains tied to ""Hoop Dreams,"" which provides his motivational speaking platform in schools, and still inspires viewers to send warm messages from places as far off as Australia and China. He also sells apparel inspired by the film, including a throwback jersey from his school days.

Gates was the more heralded of the two, receiving interest from top college basketball programs and a grant to attend the prestigious St. Joseph's high school -- the same school that is shown releasing Agee, seemingly for not playing well enough as a freshman.

But Gates blew out his knee at 16, then rushed back to the court after surgery and reinjured it. Though he played at Marquette University, the injury crippled his pro potential.

""For me, it's bittersweet on many levels,"" says Gates about the film which he has not watched in over 16 years. ""It was a constant reminder of what could have been and what didn't happen, and also a reminder that Curtis is no longer here to hear his voice.""

Nevertheless, he looks back on ""Hoop Dreams"" as a ""life turning situation,"" one that led to an allegiance with Michael Jordan, who invited him to pickup games before his comeback with the Washington Wizards. (An injury derailed Gates' own tryout with the Wizards, however.)

""It has opened doors,"" he says. ""It has done things that I never thought would happen in my life.""

Dwyane Wade is pictured dunking the ball.

'The first reality show'

What began as a short film idea from director Steve James and producer Frederick Marx to shoot Chicago playground basketball in 1987 with a budget of $2,000 quickly took on greater ambitions.

The pair hired Peter Gilbert as a cinematographer (later added as a producer), and the trio followed Gates and Agee on and off for nearly five years. With 250 hours of footage to edit, the production took seven years in total, eventually raising the $750,000 necessary for completion.

When it was finally released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" went viral, though the term had not yet been coined. It was nominated for best film editing at the Oscars, but snubbed for best documentary and picture, which had critics like Ebert up in arms.

""I've actually gotten way more mileage personally as a filmmaker out of not being nominated than I ever would have by getting nominated,"" says James, who stays in contact with Agee and Gates. ""Over the years a lot more people seem to be upset on our behalf than I was personally.""

By the time it ended its theatrical run, ""Hoop Dreams"" became the then-highest grossing documentary of all time, paving the way for hundreds of sports documentaries and streaming series currently on air.

""I call it the first reality show,"" says Gates. ""I think it was groundbreaking.""

Gates' enrollment in Marquette was mirrored exactly 10 years later by Wade, who also struggled to qualify academically for an NCAA scholarship and sat out his first year for academic reasons, the university confirmed.

Wade shared other similarities with both Agee and Gates, including feeling the pressure to rush back to action after knee injury which required surgery at Marquette. Though the operation was successful, Wade later said it led to complications as a pro.

""I watched it when I was at Marquette from a different (angle), knowing that (Gates) was staying in the same dorm that I was standing in,"" says Wade, who -- also like Gates -- was caring for a child (son Zaire) while in college.

Wade was separated from his mother Jolinda at a young age when she succumbed to drugs , leading to spells in jail. Like Agee's father Bo, she turned to religion after getting clean, now serving as a church minister.

""Obviously, I was able to make it,"" but there are challenges, he adds. ""What I learned at the time is you learn a lot about other people sharing their story.""

William Gates was a 17-year-old high school junior when his daughter Alicia was born.

'Controlled corruption'

Rewatching ""Hoop Dreams"" 25 years later lends perspective to how fast top college recruits are forced to grow up, and how much is at stake early on.

Gates' daughter was born when he was 17, during his junior year of high school. Trying to be a father and student while rehabilitating from two knee surgeries to make it as the next Isiah Thomas -- the former St Joe's and NBA star who makes a cameo in the movie -- became too much to bear.

By the movie's final scene, with his passion for the game already waning, Gates remarks, ""When somebody says, 'When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,' I should say to them, 'Well if I don't make it, you don't forget about me.""

It's no wonder he needed a break from the sport by his third year at Marquette.

""I didn't feel like a 19 or 20 year-old-kid, I felt like a kid who had been working 10 to 12 years at a job,"" Gates says, estimating that basketball practice and travel would take up to 60 hours a week in college. ""I had a lot on my plate.""

Agee had his own growing up to do, with his academics thrown into disarray after his brief spell at St Joe's, followed by Bo walking out and his mother Sheila losing her job.

In one scene, Sheila cannot pay her electricity bill and the family is left without power, while a clearly humiliated Agee broods at the camera.

(The filmmakers pitched in to get the power back on, leaving that detail out of the film. ""We didn't want to look self-serving, but we felt an obligation to do that much for them,"" says James.)

Agee transferred to Marshall High, leading the team on an improbable city championship and state semifinal run.

In recent years the public high school has been rocked by gun violence , leaving seven former basketball players dead and two paralyzed, including Agee's ex-teammate Shawn Harrington.

""I didn't let St. Joe's defeat me; I didn't let my neighborhood and my environment pull me in to gain drugs, carrying the guns -- that whole lifestyle,"" Agee reflects.

It helped that the teenagers had the right people on their sides. Gates and Agee admit they were given cash during their basketball ascent by the likes of so-called street agents, drug dealers and university affiliates who often helped promising players.

In ""Hoop Dreams"" Agee pays for Air Jordan gear at a store with money received from drug pushers. While at Arkansas State, he says a ""big street pharmacist"" whose team he played for in a high school summer league bought him a car.

""That was part of the deal,"" says Gates of being offered gifts from universities as a highly touted recruit, before committing to Marquette. ""It was like, 'Hey, you need anything let us know.' And you let them know and they took care of stuff.

""Hey I need transportation, hey I need clothes, I need shoes. They figured out how to get it to you,"" he says. ""They did it through a friend of the program that you didn't even know was a friend of the program. That's the way it was.""

In response, Marquette said it ""is committed to the highest ethical standards for the recruitment and retention of our student-athletes,"" while Arkansas State said it had no knowledge of Agee's car purchase and that ""there are too many unknown variables to comment further about a relationship from approximately 25 years ago.""



Arthur Agee was recruited to play at St Joseph's prep school as an eighth grader. A year later he was asked to leave, and his parents were billed for tuition they struggled to pay for.

Somewhat fittingly, Gates is now a full-time coach in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), the collection of summer leagues that insiders say has replaced high school basketball as the launching pad for college prospects.

Among the players that have passed through Team Hoop Dreams are all three of Gates' sons, William Jr., a recent graduate of Houston Baptist University, Jalon, a junior guard at Houston Baptist, and Marques, currently in high school.

AAU has come under fire by an ongoing FBI investigation involving sneaker companies funneling money towards recruits to land at big university programs. The AAU told CNN it does not fund its teams, calling the situation an ""apparel company scandal, not an AAU scandal.""

""People are buying and selling players; it's a human trafficking market."" says Michael Sokolove, author of ""The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino,"" which sheds light on college basketball corruption.

Multiple federal investigations have led to guilty pleas from four college assistants on bribery charges, the conviction of an Adidas executive, and the firing of Pitino from Louisville.

Pitino maintains he had ""no knowledge"" of infractions during his tenure as Louisville's head coach. James Gatto, Adidas' former head of global sports marketing, is appealing his nine-month prison sentence for wire fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with a $100,000 offer to the father of a Louisville recruit.

With athletic wear companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to support top AAU programs, the potential to use them as a means to distribute money to the families of top players or an influential coach is high, says Sokolove.

""Some of this is laundered money. These teams can be used as pass through,"" he says, adding that the ultimate goal is to breed loyalty with players who become walking advertisements for the shoe companies on the court.

The stakes have become much higher to land top recruits like Gates was in the days of ""Hoop Dreams,"" notes Sokolove. ""There are more people with their hands in the cookie jar and the kids are largely pawns in this whole endeavor.""

In 2017 the NCAA surpassed $1 billion in revenue, mostly through TV rights, while top players like Zion Williamson of Duke are limited to a compensation of tuition, room and board with a modest stipend.

Like many around the sport, Gates thinks college players need to get paid. He suggests universities contribute $100,000 towards a ""graduation fund"" for the player if he stays in school four years ""to get prepared to live life.""

Gates sees the current NBA age requirement of 19 as an obstacle towards paying black athletes, calling it a ""controlled corruption"" not seen in mostly white sports like baseball, tennis, golf or soccer.

""The two sports that are heavily dominated by African-Americans, it seems like there is always an issue when it comes to money,"" he says. (The NFL enforces a three-year rule before most college football players can turn pro.)

NCAA president Mark Emmert told the Associated Press this month that the organization has ""serious issues which require serious change,"" but paying players will remain unlikely.

William Gates (center) is now an AAU coach in Texas. His sons William Jr. (left) and Jalon played together at Houston Baptist University.

'Part of a bigger story'

Coinciding with the movie's anniversary, Gates and his wife Catherine just celebrated their 25th year of marriage. The eldest of their four children Alicia, who was born during filming, is 30 and works as a dental hygienist.

For years Gates would not allow his sons to watch all of ""Hoop Dreams,"" fearing the scenes of his injuries would spook them. He finally relented, though Will Jr underwent four knee procedures of his own in college.

Agee has fathered five children, with his youngest Devin a budding youth basketball player in his own right. Devin's mother Jennifer Genovesi stood by Agee in the wake of a 2017 arrest after a woman accused him of battery.

Agee was quick to call James -- who he refers to as an uncle -- to assure him of his innocence. The charges were dropped shortly afterward.

""I'm part of a bigger story in this film. I never want to bring any despair or negativity into the story,"" Agee says. ""He was like, 'We'll get through it together,' and that was good as that.""

""I feel like they know that I'm here for them,"" says James, the film's director.

The special bond between the parties involved in the film was reflected once ""Hoop Dreams,"" which was never expected to be a commercial success, caught fire. In a highly unusual step, Agee and Gates were made equal partners by the producers.

""They weren't just filmmakers,"" says Agee. ""They came in over a period of time and got to know me and my family, and then stayed in touch.""

Arthur Agee bought his mother Sheila a house with royalties earned from ""Hoop Dreams."" He now uses the film as material for his job in motivational speaking.

Gates and Agee first received nearly $200,000 each, and Agee promptly brought his parents a four-bedroom house in a suburb.

His mother, Sheila Agee, who was seen at the end of the movie graduating tops in her nursing class, relocated to Alabama in the wake of Bo's death.

After Curtis' murder, Gates was given an unlikely last shot at the NBA at age 29 with a tryout with the Chicago Bulls. But bad luck struck again when he caught the flu on the day of the workout.

""I said maybe God doesn't want me to play basketball,"" he reflects. ""That's when my ministry life began to open up.""

Gates received his master's in biblical studies and worked as a pastor at the Cabrini Green housing project he grew up in before settling in Texas.

He is thankful that Curtis got to meet Jordan before he was killed -- another imprint tied to his fame from the film.

""What came along with that was the responsibility to teach, educate, be a friend, have some compassion and show some understanding,"" Gates says.

""I've been very honored, privileged and grateful to be part of ""Hoop Dreams,"" he reflects. ""It's been super amazing to be a part of something that has withstood the test of time."""
96,2018-08-17 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2018/08/17/football/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-social-media-fans-china-spt-intl/index.html,Has the digital age changed football fans?,"(CNN) Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home.

A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.

Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform.

""I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for,"" the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport.

Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.

With 139m Instagram followers, 74m on Twitter and over 122m on Facebook, Ronaldo is the most followed footballer on social media.

Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented.

Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.

""There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China,"" says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.

""In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.""

But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon.

The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.

Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?

If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?

Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players.

""There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.""

George Best is regarded as the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status.

Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.

At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were ""the Best family sausages.""

But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.

Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web.

The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us ""like neurons in a giant brain"" and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots.

If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world.

Fans wear Ronaldo and Messi masks during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

""There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed,"" says Chadwick.

""The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions.

""For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons.

""Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba.""

Teenager Mbappe's goals and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.

France forward Mbappe was named the best young player at Russia 2018.

""We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe,"" says Chadwick.

""There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.

""I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other?

""I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.""

'Portfolio fandom'

Then there is ""portfolio fandom"" as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting ""the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.""

Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.

The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media. Michael Calvin

The popularity of the football program ""Football Italia"" which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe.

Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region.

These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.

""You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans,"" says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author.

""The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.""

Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad.

""I don't feel it's very healthy,"" adds Calvin. ""They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.

""The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.""

Millwall fans outside The Den before a Championship match.

In his latest book ""The State of Play,"" Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.

Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next.

You're born into being a Millwall fan. With the working clubs it's a birthright. Michael Avery

Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.

""You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them',"" Avery tells CNN Sport.

""You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.""

While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity.

""Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages,"" he explains.

""I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.""

This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.

In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.'

Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed.

St. Pauli fans hold aloft a flag with the club's recognizable symbol.

Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full.

The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable.

""FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me,"" Barrett tells CNN Sport.

""Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.""

Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies.

""It's a different kind of fan,"" Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.

""As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.""

It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most.

""The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally,"" says Chadwick.

""The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans.

""But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.

""When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too.

""What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.

""For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them."""

Dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge , this race against the clock -- to be staged in late September or early October -- is being backed by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire owner of chemical firm INEOS, which recently purchased British Cycling's Team Sky.

""It's human nature to push boundaries,"" said the INEOS 1:59 Challenge website. ""The drive to learn and achieve more is in our DNA. In Autumn this year Eliud Kipchoge, with support from INEOS, plans to redefine the limits of human achievement by breaking the last great barrier of modern athletics -- the two-hour marathon.""

Last week Ratcliffe and INEOS were accused by environmental protesters of ""sportswashing"" -- using sport to enhance reputation -- an accusation the Briton completely rejects.

Speaking to reporters ahead of cycling's Tour de Yorkshire, Ratcliffe took aim at those who criticized his company's fracking project, claiming the majority of environmental groups he has met are ""ignorant"" of the process, adding it remains a cheap source of energy.

Eliud Kipchoge is expected to take part in the event in September or October 2019.

98,2018-10-17 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/17/sport/gay-bowl-xviii-nfl-denver-broncos-intl-spt/index.html,Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives,"Denver, Colorado (CNN) Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.

Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.

Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.

""I came out when I was 24 or 25,"" Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. ""It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it.""

""I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.""

Dorien Bryant set records in four years at Purdue University, but walked away from an NFL contract to live an openly gay life.

For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.

""It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was,"" he says. ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League.

Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.

Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder.

""The competition has progressively gotten better,"" says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. ""The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.""

""I'm happier than I ever was,"" said Byrant (#9). ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS.

Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota.

Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.

Games are governed by a 57-page rule book , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.

""I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big,"" says co-founder Jim Buzinski, ""but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.""

Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.

The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.

""This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of,"" says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. ""It is so routine that no one cares.""

""These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.""

For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.

""The majority of my friends in DC are in the league,"" says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.

""I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.""

Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas.

""How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon,"" he says. ""You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.""

""That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening."" Santos' parents now attend their games often and ""are really into it.""

""These are like everyday people that love sports,"" he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.

What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro.

""Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete,"" says Santos, who is black. ""It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs.""

Gay Bowl participants take a knee during the singing of the American national anthem on the opening morning of the tournament, September 14, 2018.

Bryant agrees. ""Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak,"" he says, ""it's just that those guys are afraid.""

The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward.

""There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now,"" he says. ""It's slow, but it's progress.""

It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan to suicide before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge.

Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended.

""Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond?"" says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.

""I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it,"" he adds. ""After college, I just became more open with it.

""There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Gay Bowl XVIII athletes congregated at a welcoming party at a rooftop bar in Denver, Colorado.

Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.

Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.

Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. ""I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff,"" says Roberts.

""This is legit,"" says Allison. ""First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.""

""A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights,"" he adds, noting that in the gay leagues ""people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.""

During his first practice, the quarterback felt ""a different vibe"" straight away. ""Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'""

Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes ""straight allies"" on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.

""He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind),"" he says, ""but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.""

""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.""

Warriors captain Preston Roberts Jr. (right), who is straight, credited the league for educating him on the LGBT community. ""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough,"" he said.

It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before.

Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. ""I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m.,"" he says.

Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.

If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.

""I'm not going to say it's never come up,"" says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, ""but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing.""

Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find.

""I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it,"" he says. ""There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.""

Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. ""We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.""

""People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity,"" he notes, adding that he never saw ""a serious violation.""

""People policed themselves."" Besides, ""there was no way we could really test for it,"" he says.

""There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.""

Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.

""At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'""

Photos: Former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers said coming out in college wasn't really an option. ""I kind of just suppressed it,"" he said. ""After college, I just became more open with it ... I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.

""We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports,"" says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. ""We can be a bit brutal with each other.""

New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football ""all encompassing,"" and even met her wife through the league.

""It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life,"" she says. ""I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.""

The Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins (right), who won her sixth Gay Bowl, says flag football is ""all-encompassing"" and met her wife through the league.

Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.

The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.

""Originally, I just wanted to play football,"" she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, ""and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now.""

""It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.""

Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl.

""Everyone has their perspectives,"" she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. ""So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.""

(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. ""It's about who's smart,"" he says. ""You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose."")

""I think about it a lot,"" Parker says. ""I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.""

The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. ""I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.""

Kaylee Parker played high school football in North Carolna before transitioning to life as a woman. The 38-year-old mechanical engineer says her flag football teammates in Phoenix are ""like my other family now.""

Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.

One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.

""He acts like I did it on purpose,"" Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. ""It will grow back.""

Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too?

""You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first,"" he says. ""But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?

""Because they are gay men? Like, we can play,"" he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. ""It is a recreational league, but we can play."""

Here's what it means,"(CNN) The United Kingdom has banned travelers from Denmark after the country reported a widespread outbreak of a new variant of the virus which causes Covid-19 in mink farms.

The development came days after the Danish government announced it planned to cull the nation's entire mink population in order to contain the spread.

There are between 15 and 17 million mink in Denmark, whereas its human population stands at around 5.5 million.

The ban came into place at 4 a.m. Saturday and means travelers from Denmark cannot enter the UK, the government said in a statement. British nationals returning home will be forced to quarantine for two weeks and, unlike other quarantine requirements for travelers entering the UK, there will be no exemptions.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Wednesday the decision to cull the minks had been made with a ""heavy heart,"" but it was necessary based on the recommendation of health authorities.

The Polish international helped Bayern, already crowned champion for the eighth straight season, to a 3-1 victory in its penultimate match of the league campaign.

Bayern Munich's Polish forward Robert Lewandowski celebrates after scoring his team's second goal in the 3-1 win over Freiburg at the Allianz Arena.

Lewandowski has grabbed 33 goals in just 30 Bundesliga matches this campaign, both his latest coming in the first half at the Allianz Arena as Bayern secured a 3-1 advantage at the break. There was no further scoring in the second half.

Gabon star Aubameyang scored 31 in the 2016/17 season for Borussia Dortmund before he moved to his current club Arsenal in the English Premier League.

With just one round of matches remaining, Lewandowski is still short of the remarkable all-time record of 40 by the legendary Bayern Munich and German striker Gerd Mueller in the 1971-72 season.

The Bundesliga club has gained a reputation of finding and fostering world-class talent; taking young players with potential and developing them into world beaters.

Its record speaks for itself.

The likes of Christian Pulisic and Ousmane Dembélé have all, at different stages, walked through Dortmund's halls and gone on to play at the very highest level, making the club a handsome profit in return.

The current squad now boasts prodigious talents such as Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland who, already, are considered two of the best players in world football and who will, one day, demand eye-watering transfer fees.

But this isn't just a happy accident. It's a very deliberate strategy that has transformed Dortmund into real contenders -- both domestically and in the Champions League -- despite it not being able to compete financially with some of the continent's biggest teams.

The club's enviable philosophy was borne from its near bankruptcy in 2005, forcing it to do business differently to some of its wealthier rivals.

""I think we at Dortmund have a clear idea, a clear philosophy and we give these players experience and playing time,"" Lars Ricken, Dortmund's youth academy director, told CNN Sport.

""I think that is the difference to some other clubs and our unique characteristic. That is the reason why a lot of young promising players find their way to Dortmund.""

Jadon Sancho is one of the latest youngsters to appear in the first team.

Scouting network

Locating young players with the potential to become superstars is no mean feat and the club relies on its impressive scouting system to unearth the next big thing.

It's an operation run by Markus Pilawa, whose small team compile an in-depth analysis of every player they watch and speak regularly with the first-team management to confirm a player's suitability.

He's tasked with signing both established professionals and new talent in order to find the right balance in the squad.

""I think it's very, very important to have a good mix,"" he told CNN Sport, referring to the likes of Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel as the experienced heads in the current team.

""In recent years, we had maybe a squad that was too young. There were no leaders inside to lead the young guys. All of these guys here are top, top talented, but they are still still young.""

Now, because of the soaring prices demanded for the best footballers, Dortmund focuses much of its attention on young talent. The scouting process of which can start as young as 14.

Pilawa ideally monitors a youngster for up to two years before making a move, ensuring the player has the personality to cope with the club's huge demands.

""We are a Champions League club and we are competing with Bayern Munich, so we need a top level of talent and there are not that many guys on the planet,"" he said.

""Most of them are coming from abroad, so you need a big personality to come from your own country to a new club, a new language. It's very, very difficult.""

Amongst the current crop of young players making their way into the first team is Jude Bellingham, who the club had tried to sign last year.

The 17-year-old eventually joined from English side Birmingham for more than $30 million in July, disappointing a host of other European clubs desperate for the midfielder's signature.

Pilawa credits the club's track record for securing such a sought-after talent, especially when other teams can offer higher wages.

""We can show them we are not lying,"" he said, referencing the likes of Sancho and Pulisic who have successfully navigated the youth system.

""There are a lot of players and it's not 10 years ago or 15 years ago. It's last year, it's two years ago, three years ago. Every year we have the next one.

""We can show them that we have the experience. We know how it works and I think they are trusting us because we are not lying, we're not telling them fairy tales.""

Jude Bellingham is considered one of the brightest talents in world football.

The next big thing?

Whilst Bellingham has gone straight into the first team this season -- scoring in his debut on Monday -- there are also those graduating from the club's academy. Chief amongst them is US starlet Giovanni Reyna.

The American, whose mother and father both played international soccer for the US, joined Dortmund in 2019 from New York City's youth academy and is now making strides into the first team.

The club expects a lot from the creative midfielder who has benefited from the unique set up at the club.

In addition to high-quality training, a portion of Dortmund's success with young players is down to attention to detail.

The club's top young talents, identified by the team of coaches, regularly meet for one-on-one sessions which seek to help them both on and off the pitch.

Otto Addo, who played for Dortmund and the Ghanian national team before retiring in 2008, is often the man they meet.

He worked closely with Reyna as he made his way up to the first team, offering personal coaching on different parts of the game.

Working with three or four 'top talents' in every age group, Addo creates bespoke training sessions which cover four main topics; technique, tactics, physicality and mentality.

But it's not always the best players that end up meeting with Addo. Instead, it's those who show the most potential.

Addo says Reyna's potential was obvious to see from the very start and is excited to see him flourish at the highest level.

""He [Renya] was one of our top talents from under 17s and under 19s and I worked a lot with him. We trained extra and we also did video analysis after every match he had,"" he said.

""I could see Gio [Reyna] straight away. We have a lot of good technical players but it's his technique under pressure. To make no mistakes under pressure, to change direction under pressure and to accelerate in the midfield.

""He also has game intelligence, to position himself always between the lines, to read the game and he knows what's next. He brings a lot, way more than other players from his age group.""

Giovanni Reyna is expected to make an impact in the first team this season.

US market

It's no coincidence that two of Dortmund's latest talents to flourish have been American; Pulisic and Reyna.

The US, not yet known for its football culture, is somewhat of an untapped resource in the sport but Dortmund knows there is talent to be found.

For the last three years, Pilawa has worked to develop Dortmund's scouting network in the region and believes it can be a gold mine for clubs willing to work hard.

""It's a very important and interesting market for us. I know that there are not 10 top talents in every age group, but maybe there's one every three years and I have to know him,"" he said.

""I think the adaptation to Germany is not that big [...] everyone is speaking English here in the dressing room.

""It's not like maybe the French guys and Spanish guys who have some more problems to adapt because of the language.""

Youth coordinator Ricken is fully aware of the difficulties a young player might face when joining a new team and the club has methods of softening the move.

Players without English take up to four lessons a week to learn the language which helps them integrate with their new surroundings.

""It's not easy for them because they have new teammates, a new language and are away from the parents. They have to be very grown up at a young age. We feel a social responsibility for those young players,"" he said.

Christian Pulisic moved to Chelsea after making his name at Dortmund.

'A hard-worker region'

Searching for a player with the right mentality does not distract from the technical ability required to compete among Europe's elite.

Pace, technique and tactical awareness are all must-have attributes if you're going to play in front of Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, with a capacity of 80,000 raucous fans.

""I think that is one reason why the atmosphere in our stadium is so great, because there is a marvelous identification between fans and players,"" Ricken said.

""Our supporters want to see players from Dortmund, who were born in Dortmund or who have been educated in our youth department.""

The connection with the local community runs deep at Dortmund which, despite its global appeal, wants to continue representing the region it serves.

That begins with recruiting the right players who mirror the attitude of the city.

""Dortmund is a hard-worker region. A lot of people working hard and a lot of industry,"" Pilawa said.

""They love hungry people who are ready to fight until the end for their club. So this is a very, very important issue for me when I'm selecting players.

""Jude Bellingham is the perfect player for Borussia Dortmund, for example, because his mentality and his attitude on the pitch is the perfect one to connect the club with the fans and the fans with the club.

""I think it will get more important after this crisis [pandemic] because I think that the people in the stands are thinking more about football in general.

""Right now, you need the right guys on the pitch, with the right personality, showing 'I'm fighting for the club for you fans' because it's a very tough time for everyone here, especially in our region.""

Dortmund began the new season with a crushing 5-0 win over third-tier side Duisburg in the German Cup on Monday.

It now faces Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday, marking the start of the new Bundesliga season. Lucien Favre's side finished a distant second behind rivals Bayern Munich last season but now has the squad to potentially challenge once again."

118,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/tech/apple-event-coronavirus-2020/index.html,Analysis: There's no such thing as too many Apple events,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Less than 24 hours before Election Day, Apple announced it would host its fourth major event of the year the following week.

The November 10event, like all the others this year, will take place via livestream on the company's website. And like the others,didn't reveal too much about what it's planning to announce, touting it only as ""One more thing."" But users can likely expect the first Mac devices with Apple's in-house chips , which the company said would be available before the end of this year.

The company has already rolled out several ""things"" at periodic intervals this year. Last month, it launched the long-awaited iPhone 12 lineup with four different models. A month before that, it unveiled two new Apple Watch models, two new iPads, a new fitness class subscription serviceand a subscription bundle. In June, it detailed several software updates at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) . And in March and April — just as the coronavirus was starting to force the United States into lockdown — came relatively quieter rollouts of a new MacBook Air, iPad Pro and a low-cost iPhone SE

Inevitably, a legion of Apple fans will tune in to Tuesday's event, but the fact that they're doing it for a third time in as many months raises the question: Is there such a thing as too much Apple?

While the prospect of yet another Apple event may lead to exasperated groans in some corners, the world's most valuable company will probably do itself no harm.

Fatigue

It's been a long and difficult year, and Apple's decision to host yet another virtual livestream has been met with bemusement and raised eyebrows by at least some Twitter users

Samsung SSNLF Google GOOGL Remember, it's not just Apple beating people over the head with new products. The tech world has been saturated with livestreamed virtual launch events this year thanks to the pandemic, with rivals such asandrolling out several products of their own.

The potential risk is that prospective customers could get weary of the slickly produced marketing — a tech livestream version of "" Zoom fatigue "" — and hold off on making some purchases.

""After a while, yeah, I think that the magic wears off, especially with these virtual events,"" William Stofega, program director for mobile device technology and trends at research firm IDC, told CNN Business. ""Trying to pay attention while people are in your apartment ... running around, it's hard.""

There's also the massive hit to the economy from the coronavirus that has curtailed many people's spending power.

While early demand for the iPhone 12 appears to be strong , it remains to be seen whether Apple will get a similar response to its less high-profile offerings — including the new Macs expected on Tuesday.

Some consumers certainly value a break from the barrage of negative news, but the unbridled enthusiasm of tech executives can be grating as well.

""The upbeat messages — it's nice to hear, but then when you're struggling, if you have a cutback at your job, there's always that bleed-over and that could dull the reception,"" Stofega said. ""The thing that garners the most attention, obviously, is the iPhone and some of the media products, but ... it can be a little excessive after a while.""

It's worth noting that Apple has been forced into staggering some of its launches this year. The coronavirus hit the company's global supply chains and delayed production of the iPhone 12 by a few weeks, forcing it into an October launch instead of its usual mid-September timeframe (Apple rolled out watches and iPads then instead).

Nothing to lose

For Apple, like many companies holding livestreamed events, there's very little downside. It's cheaper and more efficient to produce a one-hour video than it is to host hundreds of reporters and analysts at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, as it usually does. And more events just means more eyeballs and more buzz around its products — livestream fatigue notwithstanding.

""Especially now during the Covid-19 pandemic people are spending more time at home and consuming media, which is what Apple is capitalizing on,"" said Maurice Klaehne, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. ""These virtual launches have been very well attended and keeping them shorter seems to be working to capture the attention of the viewers.""

And there are signs that the frequent rollouts are helping the company's bottom line.

""While Apple has indeed added more launches this year, it has not hurt the company,"" Klaehne said. ""In fact, looking at the most recent earnings reports, Apple increased revenues in all categories.""

The company has expanded its emphasis on services with more offerings as the growth in its device sales has slowed -- take, for example, the Apple One subscription bundle it announced earlier this year. Tuesday's event should help further its services ambitions, with analysts previously saying the switch to in-house chips for Macs will enable Apple's software and services to work together more seamlessly across devices

Klaehne says virtual events make that part of the business an easier sell.

""While Apple has historically been driven by its hardware sales, it's continuing to expand its service revenues,"" he said. ""Having more launches will only help the company grow this service revenue stream."""

""To achieve the estimated 80% of uptake of the vaccine required for community protection, we need a serious, well-funded and community-based public engagement strategy.""

Tech stocks were among the biggest losers in Asia. Hui pointed out that investors might be pricing in expectations that demand for some tech products and services will slow as employees gradually return to the office.

Several major global economies are also still in the throes of the pandemic.

The United States has surpassed more than 10 million cases since the start of the pandemic, and has topped 100,000 new infections seven days in a row. One expert told CNN that the country could soon hit 200,000 daily Covid-19 cases.

""We are watching cases increase substantially in this country far beyond, I think, what most people ever thought could happen,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm has been named a member of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board.

Europe is also struggling. The United Kingdom, France and Germany are under lockdown to stem a rise in cases, and their economies are at risk of falling back into recession

The better-than-expected vaccine news is especially critical for the oil industry because the pandemic caused an unprecedented collapse in demand for jet fuel and gasoline.

With Covid-19 infections spiking around the United States and Europe, investors feared new health restrictions that would hurt economic growth and thus demand for oil, which is the lifeblood of the global economy.

""Oil is rallying like a mad thing, joining the dots between a potential vaccine and a rebound in global demand growth,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.

121,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/business/pfizer-covid-vaccine/index.html,Pfizer CEO: Our vaccine timing had nothing to do with politics,"New York (CNN Business) Pfizer's encouraging news about the effectiveness of its Covid-19 vaccine came nearly a week after Election Day. But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says the timing had nothing to do with politics.

In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Bourla said he first learned about the results of the trial Sunday and he has yet to see the data, throwing cold water on the idea that there was any political motivation behind releasing the news after voters in the United States chose their candidate for president.

Pfizer took several interim looks at the data during its vaccine trial, but it did not have enough infections in its test group to gain any meaningful data -- until Sunday, Gupta reported. If anything, the data came earlier than expected: In October, Bourla made a comment in an open letter on Pfizer's website, saying, ""Based on our current trial enrollment and dosing pace, we estimate we will reach this milestone in the third week of November.""

The Trump administration was quick to take credit for Pfizer's promising news. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Pfizer's development was ""thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President Donald Trump.""

President Trump, however, lashed out at Pfizer and the FDA over the drug company's announcement.

""As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before,"" Trump tweeted Monday evening. ""Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!"" he tweeted

Moments later, Trump wrote in another tweet if President-elect Biden were president, ""you wouldn't have the Vaccine for another four years.""

Not warp speed

Yet Pfizer was not part of the Trump administration's ""Operation Warp Speed,"" which provided incentives to pharmaceutical companies to ramp up their development of a coronavirus vaccine.

Pfizer PFE BioNTech BNTX The US federal government promised $1.95 billion toand partnerto assist with the distribution of the vaccine once it's ready -- but the government is not directly working to help its development.

Trump had called drug companies, pressuring them for new developments before Election Day. He explicitly told the companies' CEOs that he'd like to see a vaccine move quicker than some of his health advisers said was reasonable , CNN has reported.

On Monday morning, President-elect Joe Biden issued a statement welcoming the ""excellent news"" and congratulating the ""brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough.""

He added that ""it is also important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away"" and ""it will be many more months before there is a widespread vaccination"" in the United States.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Pfizer's vaccine news bodes well for other Covid-19 vaccines in development and added that Pfizer was able to get results quickly due to the severity of the pandemic.

Making the vaccine

Although the vaccine is not set to be widely administered soon, Pfizer said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months following their second dose of the vaccine.

Pfizer has at least three vaccine manufacturing sites in the United States, Gupta said. At the Kalamazoo, Michigan, facility, there are several refrigerators -- that span about the length of a football field -- that are used to store the vaccine.

For months companies have been racing to develop, and eventually distribute, an effective coronavirus vaccine. The race shows no signs of slowing as companies continue to move their vaccine candidates through clinical trials, growing closer to determining which will be considered safe and effective.

Vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna utilize new technology that has never been used in vaccines before, and experts say that in itself is a reason to be cautious.

While the developments mean that progress is being made, they will do little to mitigate the coronavirus winter surge in the short term given that it will be well into 2021 before the dose is available to all Americans."

Pfizer revealed Monday that data show its trial coronavirus vaccine is more than 90% effective, exceeding even the most optimistic expectations. The breakthrough set Wall Street zooming to record heights on hopes for afull economic recovery.

But while the vaccine could be an economic gamechanger, it will take months before doses are widely available -- and the US economy badly needs help now in the form of stimulus.

""This is some of the most unambiguously good news for the economy that we've had in a long time,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM International. ""We now can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And it's not an oncoming train.""

Lawmakers have to complete the bridge they started building at the beginning of the pandemic to get us to the end of the pandemic when people will feel comfortable going to restaurants and ballgames.""

Yet it's crucial that politicians in Washington don't get lulled into a false sense of complacency -- or use the vaccine progress as an excuse to put off or limit the amount of fiscal relief.

""Lawmakers have to complete the bridge they started building at the beginning of the pandemic to get us to the end of the pandemic when people will feel comfortable going to restaurants and ballgames,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Failure to provide aid would risk lasting economic damage, with bankruptcies and business closures hindering a full recovery. Industries like restaurants, hotels , concert halls and airlines continue to be crushed by the health crisis, and they can't wait much longer for support.

The dark winter hasn't been canceled

Economists have urged Congress to consider providing enhanced unemployment benefits, forgivable loans to small businesses, aid to the travel industry and funds that prevent a wave of layoffs by local governments hit by massive revenue shortfalls.

The need for fiscal relief is amplified by the worsening pandemic. Infections are soaring, hospitalizations are climbing and deaths are elevated. A record 126,742 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Saturday alone -- the fourth straight day above 100,000 .

""We're still facing a very dark winter,"" President-elect Joe Biden said Monday after the vaccine announcement.

The economic rebound will be slowed by new health restrictions. For instance, Rhode Island recently announced a stay-at-home advisory that begins at 10 pm on weeknights and 10:30 pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

""The vaccine is great. It makes everyone feel better. But at the end of the day, the pandemic is as bad as it's ever been,"" said Zandi. ""We still have a lot of unemployed people, small businesses struggling to survive, airlines running on fumes.""

'I would have starved'

Pfizer PFE Rainbow Rhodes, a career bartender/mixologist out of work since March, expressed optimism about thevaccine.

""The vaccine is promising because people will believe and trust enough to start coming back out,"" said Rhodes, a 40-year-old who lives in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""Until the restaurants, bars and nightlife scene is opened back to full capacity, there's no way a lot of people like us get jobs.""

When lockdown orders were issued, Rhodes said her weekly income instantly went from $1,000 to zero. Rhodes has three daughters, two in their twenties and one teenager, and her husband is a career musician who's also been out of work since the spring.

""I'm insanely lucky. If not for friends and family, I would have starved. My husband and I would have had nothing,"" said Rhodes, who added most days she lives on ramen or eggs.

Rhodes urged Congress to put aside differences and reach a relief deal. ""It's absolutely ridiculous. It's a humanitarian crisis and they're just looking the other way,"" she said.

Hotels are still clamoring for help

The travel industry has been hit particularly hard . Hotel occupancy rates are nearly one-third below pre-crisis levels, according to the CNN Business Recovery Dashboard

Marriott MAR Hilton Worldwide HLT Hyatt H There's no doubt a safe and highly effective vaccine brightens the outlook. Shares ofandall surged 12% or more Monday.

""It's very exciting news,"" Best Western CEO David Kong told CNN Business Monday. ""So many people have been cooped up and feeling depressed. This gives them hope that the end is near.""

However, Kong warned the hotel industry still requires federal relief to stay afloat until a vaccine is widely distributed. And he said it's ""certainly a fear"" that the vaccine news will take the pressure off Congress to act.

""A lot of people are still suffering. It's devastating,"" said Kong, who added the spike in hotel stocks is for ""Wall Street, not Main Street.""

Like many hotels, Best Westerns are owned by franchisees rather than a deep-pocketed corporation, and they've cut an estimated 20,000 jobs during the pandemic. Additionally, the parent company that owns the hotel brand has laid off about 800 corporate associates.

Even if a vaccine is widely available in the second half of 2021, the hotel industry won't experience a ""solid recovery"" until 2023, according to S&P Global Ratings.

With the election over, Congress may not face imminent pressure to get a fiscal stimulus deal done. And Republicans are expected to retain control of the US Senate -- unless the party loses both run-off elections expected to be held in Georgia.

""That could be an opportunity to get people's attention,"" Kong said of the Georgia races.

'Premature to declare victory'

The sweeping actions from Congress and the Federal Reserve this spring were aimed at preventing economic scarring. That's because it becomes much harder for those on long-term unemployment to get rehired. Likewise, it takes time for shuttered businesses to be replaced by new ones. It's far more efficient to keep businesses open and workers working, if possible.

Gus Faucher, PNC chief economist, said the looming vaccine increases the need for Congress to prevent long-term scarring.

""We want businesses that are viable in the long run to stay open,"" said Faucher. ""It would be premature to declare victory and go home.""

The vaccine progress should minimize fears from deficit hawks that Uncle Sam is going to be on the hook for never-ending support to the economy.

""The fact the vaccine is in sight could make us feel comfortable spending this money,"" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. ""We can give you this bridge to the other side because we know it won't be the world's longest bridge."""

But it also wants to end a series of bitter trade disputes and reboot its relationship with the United States as a new administration prepares to take power in Washington.

Boeing BA Airbus EADSF The World Trade Organization last month cleared the way for tariffs to be imposed on American exports including aircraft when it delivered a ruling in favor of the European Union as part of a long-running dispute over US subsidies toand EU aid to rival planemaker. The European Commission said the tariffs will come into effect on Tuesday.

The WTO decision followed a similar award made last year in favor of the United States, which resulted in the Trump administration imposing tariffs on European goods including civil aircraft, Parmesan cheese, French wine and Scotch and Irish whiskies. European officials made clear on Monday they would prefer for both sides to drop the measures.

Tariffs act as a tax on exports, and are either absorbed by producers in the form of reduced profits, or passed on to consumers in higher prices.

""We have made clear at every stage that we want to settle this long running issue,"" executive vice president of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis told journalists at a press conference. ""Regrettably, due to lack of progress with the US, we had no other choice but to impose these countermeasures,"" he added.

The huge wager was placed October 29 on the Betfair Exchange, the world's largest online betting exchange, where gamblers find others to match their wagers. The US presidential election was by far the biggest single event in the platform's history.

Media outlets including CNN have called the race for Biden , but the bettor can't yet collect their £540,000 ($710,000) profit and original stake. A spokesperson for Betfair said Monday that the ""market will be settled once the result has been officially confirmed.""

Bets would typically be settled following a result declaration from news networks and a concession speech by the losing presidential candidate, the platform said on Friday . But this year is different.

GM could be a better bet than Tesla,"New York (CNN Business) It's been a long time since General Motors has been a hot stock for investors. Electric vehicles could turn it into one.

stock has more than doubled since early April, a low-point for automakers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although that doesn't compare to the 373% rise in shares during the same time, GM is blowing away the gains at most other traditional automakers.

But GM's commitment to an all-electric future and its investment in a new generation of electric batteries and vehicles is also giving the stock new life.

""GM is one of the few [automakers] that is showing tangible progress in its transition to EVs,"" wrote Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas in a note late last month as GM announced a $2 billion investment to build electrics at a plant in Tennessee. ""Non-auto investors who missed Tesla are trying to find exposure, and GM is striking the right tone.""

Last month, the company announced an electric Hummer pickup , generating excitement from investors. The truck is due to sold by the end of next year.

""GM could be a major player in the EV market with Tesla,"" wrote Wedbush technology analyst Daniel Ives. ""The Hummer EV ... will be one of the foundational models as part of GM's $20 billion push into the EV space.""

The automaker said it targets selling 1 million combined electric vehicles a year in the Chinese and US markets over the next five years.

""GM has a strong opportunity to establish itself as a major player in the EV market over the next decade,"" Ives added.

But GM had more failures in than successes in its effort to make electric cars , including the EV1, an electric car it introduced in 1996, then quickly abandoned. That made electric and hybrid car enthusiasts hate the company for decades to come. It is still making virtually all of its money on traditional gas-powered vehicles such as full-size pickups and SUVs.

Its Chevrolet Bolt EV is the best-selling electric vehicle in the US market not made by Tesla, but that is still less than 1% of GM's overall US sales, and a fraction of the number of vehicles Tesla is selling.

But CEO Mary Barra insists that the strong sales of traditional trucks and SUVs is what giving GM the cash it needs to make the transition to electrics.

""The strength of our full-size truck platform and the franchise there, full-size SUVs, gives us excellent opportunity to self-fund our growth in EVs and then leverage all the assets we bring, whether it's manufacturing, engineering, technology,"" she told investors in a conference call Thursday following the strong earnings report.

One reason that investors have been excited about electric vehicles is Tesla has demonstrated they can be more profitable than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

""EVs require about 30% less labor and significantly less parts and complexity in the manufacturing process, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, which will be another driver of EVs being cheaper ... in the medium term,"" wrote Jonas. ""As [automakers] produce more EVs in greater numbers, they will generate significant economies of scale and operating leverage and be able to pass through the economics to the customer, reducing the price of EVs for consumers.""

So that explains GM's commitment to electrics. Beyond any desire to combat climate change or improve the environment, GM also intends to eventually improve its bottom line. And that also explains why those who want to invest in electric vehicles are giving one of the oldest automakers a new look."

Metalysis, a materials technology firm based in South Yorkshire, England, said Friday that it has been awarded a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to further develop a method of extracting extraterrestrial oxygen from materials found on the moon's surface.

In research published this year, scientists affiliated with Metalysis said they could extract 96% of oxygen from debris found on the moon's surface, known as lunar regolith, and leave behind a mixed metal alloy that could be used for construction.

The process, which was developed at the University of Cambridge, has already been established to work on earth. Now, Metalysis has received around £250,000 (around $329,000) in funding from the ESA to perfect it in an extra-terrestrial environment, Ian Mellor, the company's managing director, told CNN Business.

The project is a step in the development of a sustainable source of oxygen on the moon — needed to support human life on permanent lunar bases, and championed by agencies including the ESA, which has shown support for a ""Moon Village"" — and to provide the fuel for vehicles landing on and launching from the moon.

Don't expect drastic changes when Joe Biden takes the helm, even if he eschews the bluster and unpredictability of his predecessor.

Economists and trade experts believe that the United States and China will move further apart on trade and technology as Washington continues to scrutinize virtually every aspect of its relationship with the world's second-largesteconomy.

""We have a fundamental, systematic rivalry between these two systems,"" said Alex Capri, research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and senior fellow and lecturer at the National University of Singapore. ""In many ways, that rivalry is going to intensify.""

Fundamental tensions

This year highlighted major tensions and a lack of trust between the world's two most powerful nations. Despite reaching a trade agreement in January, the United States and China still have yet to resolve several points of economic conflict , including US allegations that Beijing steals American tech and gives too much preferential treatment to state-owned corporations at the expense of foreign companies.

Meanwhile, Washington has become increasingly wary of Chinese-made technology and whether it could be used to spy on Americans. That fear has caused lawmakers — Republican and Democrat — to view China as a major threat to US national security. Just look at the support for sanctions that Washington has slapped on tech firm Huawei and the steps US politicians are pushing to make it tougher for Chinese firms to trade on US exchanges, for example.

The coronavirus has only compounded those differences as China and the United States trade accusations over starting and mishandling the pandemic. And clashes over Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region have widened a political divide that will likely continue to grow in the years to come.

""Biden has been pretty clear about how he wants to proceed, and there has been bipartisan support for a tough line,"" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that the Senate could very well remain under Republican control in the new year. The best the Democrats can hope for is the narrowest of Senate majorities.

The president-elect ""will be under constant critical pressure from Republican China hawks in the Congress to be more aggressive,"" Reinsch told CNN Business late last week. ""There's not a lot they can do about that in the short term besides complain, but it will make the atmosphere worse than it already is.""

A shift in tone

There will almost certainly be a change in style with the Biden administration. Trump isn't known for mincing words: He once said that the United States could not "" continue to allow China to rape our country ,"" and referred repeatedly to Covid-19 as the "" China virus .""

it will be much more diplomatic,"" said Capri of the Heinrich Foundation. He expects the new regime to more closely follow long-established procedure before slapping China with further tariffs or sanctions. He pointed out that ""Biden's tone will be different,it will be much more diplomatic,"" said Capri of the Heinrich Foundation. He expects the new regime to more closely followlong-establishedprocedure before slapping China with further tariffs or sanctions. He pointed out that thousands of American companies have sued the United States for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, a decision they argue seriously harms their business.

frankly, during the Trump administration,"" Capri added. ""Historically, the process is they consult with US industry."" (The Trump administration has defended its hardline approach to China as necessary to right an imbalanced relationship, and the president told reporters in January that his ""phase one"" trade deal would create "" ""There was just chaos in the Department of Commerce,frankly,during the Trump administration,"" Capri added. ""Historically, the process is they consult with US industry."" (The Trump administration has defended its hardline approach to China as necessary to right an imbalanced relationship, and the president told reporters in January that his ""phase one"" trade deal would create "" economic justice "" for Americans.)

China appears to be preparing for less fiery rhetoric, too.

Sidestepping questions about Beijing's stance on the US election outcome, the Chinese government said Monday it ""noted"" that Biden has declared victory, while acknowledging the election would be determined according to US laws and procedures.

""China and the United States should strengthen communication and dialogue,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters Monday, adding that such a desire extends to promoting ""healthy and stable"" relations.

Chinese bureaucrats and diplomats are divided over whether Biden would be a better US figurehead to deal with than Trump, according to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the consultancy Eurasia Group. China's "" wolf warriors ,"" the diplomats who aggressively defend Beijing and fiercely counter criticism about the country, would probably prefer Trump, since his leadership undermines America's traditional alliance partners and provides grounds for moral equivalence in terms of human rights and unilateralism, Bremmer said last week.

On the whole though, ""the Chinese don't want to see the US model implode,"" he added. ""[They] realize they do benefit from a stable US that continues to play a large role in the global order.""

An inevitable untangling

No matter how Biden talks about US-China relations, the two countries will likely continue trying to disentangle their economies.

Analysts at JP Morgan wrote last month that a Biden victory would leave the two countries fighting over 5G networks, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.

""In vying for dominance in these areas, the US and China have set about decoupling, reducing cooperation, restricting technology sharing, even shutting ... down trade in some cases,"" they wrote.

Capri said that China has been preparing for a bigger rupture between the world's top two economies.

in fact doubling down,"" he said, adding that he expects the country to further reduce its reliance on American products. Beijing has made boosting its technological capabilities and self-sufficiency , underscoring the policy's importance. ""If you're China, you're not doing anything differently. You'rein fact doubling down,"" he said, adding that he expects the country to further reduce its reliance on American products. Beijing has made boosting its technological capabilities and self-sufficiency a core part of its next Five-Year Plan , underscoring the policy's importance.

""It's a massive problem for the Chinese Communist Party to be reliant on American technology,"" Capri said. ""It's as simple as that.""

Beijing may also find that a Biden administration is much more effective in building an international coalition to challenge China over state subsidies, rights for foreign firms or intellectual property protection. US-EU relations have been fraught under Trump as the two allies tussle over trade

""The absence of a common position among developed countries in recent years is largely because of the current US government's inclination to 'go it alone',"" wrote Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, in a research note on Monday.

""Demand for the familiar in these uncertain times is more important than ever,"" McDonald's said in its investor update, adding that it expects core menu items like its Big Mac and Quarter Pounder burgers, Chicken McNuggets and french fries to contribute to its growth moving forward.

To further promote sales of these items, McDonald's is rolling out improvements, like new, toasty buns and an ""enhanced grilling approach"" for hamburgers, as well as more chicken flavors and menu items.

It also plans to launch a new crispy chicken sandwich in the United States early next year. America's appetite for chicken sandwiches has helped make Chick-fil-A a success, and contributed to rising sales at Popeyes . McDonald's already serves a chicken sandwich, the McChicken, and often tests out new types of chicken sandwiches.

A new chicken sandwich should help give McDonald's ""credibility"" in the chicken space, said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA.

""We want customers to choose McDonald's for chicken,"" he said.

New packaging and easier ordering

McDonald's will start rolling out new packaging over the next few years.

That's not all. McDonald's is introducing new packaging with a ""modern, refreshing feel."" The company is rolling the new packaging out globally over the next few years.

And it's taking cues from another pandemic-induced trend — eating at home instead of at restaurants.

McDonald's is no exception.

The burger chain is planning to make it easier for customers to eat at home by letting more people order delivery through the McDonald's app and improving the speed and accuracy of delivery orders. It will also try out new concepts at its drive-thrus, like automated order taking, and express pickup lanes for people who placed digital orders. And it will test out restaurants with drive-thrus that are only open for delivery and pickup orders.

Plus, it's launching a new digital hub called ""MyMcDonald's,"" which will include a new loyalty program that will be piloted in Phoenix in the coming weeks.

The company has been investing in its technology for some time — it bought Dynamic Yield , an artificial intelligence company, to help it roll out smart menu boards last year. It has also purchased Apprente, another AI company that works on voice-based ordering platforms. Apprente should help automate McDonald's drive-thru.

McDonald's suffered early in the pandemic, but its sales have been improving.

In the United States, sales at stores open at least 13 months jumped 4.6% in the three months that ended on September 30 compared to the same period last year. Overall, system-wide sales were flat compared to last year. In 2021, McDonald's expects system-wide sales to grow by single digits compared to 2019.

Correction: An earlier version of this story said McDonald's was producing its own plant-based products. Beyond later said it co-created the patty of the McPlant burger."

Facebook FB available in India. , which owns the popular messaging platform, announced Friday that it had gone live with the new feature after years of regulatory hurdles prevented it from making the service widelyavailable in India.

The National Payments Corporation of India, an organization affiliated with the Reserve Bank of India , confirmed in a statement Thursday that it had given approval for WhatsApp to roll out the service to more people, starting with a user base of up to 20 million accounts.

The company had been testing the tool in India since 2018 with up to 1 million users. The country is WhatsApp's biggest market, with 400 million users

But when it comes to the fight for India's growing e-commerce market , every battle counts .

, the Seattle-based e-commerce firm owned by Jeff Bezos, is fighting a $3.3 billion deal struck between Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and the Indian retail conglomerate Future Group.

What's at stake is strategic access to a network of popular grocery stores and retail shops in India — something both Amazon and Reliance want to either have for themselves, or to prevent the other from acquiring.

""If someone backs down, it will give the impression that one has lost and the other has won, when the fight has just started,"" said Counterpoint Research analyst Tarun Pathak.

Amazon has 31.2% market share in India's e-commerce industry, just behind Walmart-owned Flipkart's 31.9%, according to a recent report from market research firm Forrester. But Ambani has made no secret of his ambitions to upend the market with JioMart, which is part of his sprawling conglomerate.

Then Covid-19 hit. India enforced one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns, ordering shops to shutter and millions of people to stay indoors for months.

The pandemic has had a ""significant adverse impact"" on Future Retail's business operations, the company said in its most recent earnings report. In July, Future Retail's credit rating took a hit after it missed a bond payment. Fitch Ratings downgraded Future Retail's rating two notches to C, signaling that the company was ""near default.""

The following month, Reliance and Future Group announced that Reliance was buying Future Retail and several other assets. The deal allowed Future Group to ""achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by Covid and the macro economic environment,"" Kishore Biyani, Future Group CEO, said in a statement at the time.

A legal dispute

The announcement took industry watchers by surprise.

""Everyone knew Amazon had a stake in Future Retail, and the deal didn't mention what would happen to Amazon's stake,"" said Satish Meena, analyst at research firm Forrester.

Amazon responded by filing a complaint to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).

Indian companies and foreign companies operating in India often agree to settle disputes in Singapore because ""it's a neutral jurisdiction with high integrity and international standards,"" according to Ashish Kabra, a lawyer who heads the International Dispute Resolution & Investigations Practice for Nishith Desai Associates in Singapore.

The arbitration process is confidential and none of the submissions are public.

Amazon argued that the 2019 deal struck between it and the Future Group entity included a non-compete clause, a person familiar with Amazon's perspective told CNN Business. The clause listed 30 restricted parties with which Future Retail and Future Group could not do business, and Reliance was on that list, the person said.

""The key question really is what's the validity of contracts if you just ignore them,"" said the person familiar with Amazon's side.

""Are companies just going to ignore contracts and do what they please?""

A SIAC emergency arbitrator gave Amazon a small victory this week when it ordered a temporary halt on Future Group's deal with Reliance, according to the legal order seen by Reuters , which has not been made public.

Future Group had argued that if the deal with Reliance falls through, its retail unit will be forced into liquidation and 29,000 people will lose their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited the Singapore order. The order is not public, but the person familiar with Amazon's perspective confirmed that Future presented this argument.

But the arbitrator ruled that ""economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations,"" according to the order, Reuters reported.

""We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.

CNN Business contacted Future Group for comment, and received a statement from Future Retail.

Future Retail said it ""is examining the communication and the order"" from SIAC.

Reliance (RRVL) said in a statement that its deal with Future Retail is ""fully enforceable"" under Indian law.

""RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,"" said the statement.

But in the past, Indian courts have usually followed the lead of orders passed by emergency arbitrators outside of India, according to Kabra, the lawyer.

""What parties have previously done, is they approach Indian Courts and ask for similar reliefs in India, while relying on the order of the Emergency Arbitrator. Indian Courts usually grant the same relief,"" said Kabra.

A 'clash of the titans'

For Reliance, which operates 11,000 stores throughout India, and Amazon, the No. 2 e-commerce player in the country, Future Retail's 1,500 stores are not a must have, says one analyst.

""It's not like without it you can't have your ambitions, if you don't have Future [Retail],"" said Pathak, of Counterpoint Research.

This is ""less about Future and more about the clash of the titans,"" as well as ""protecting your turf,"" he added.

To compete with Amazon and Flipkart, Ambani's JioMart has been growing its presence in India. It expanded to hundreds of cities across India earlier this year and plans to branch into electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare soon. The company will also likely tap into Reliance Retail's network of physical stores across the country to fulfill online orders, according to analysts.

The industry had expected Amazon and Reliance to forge some kind of deal in the future, because they need each other's expertise, according to Meena, of Forrester. Amazon needs more shops to expand inventory and use retail spaces as storage and delivery hubs. And Reliance doesn't have a lot of experience in e-commerce, according to Meena.

But any kind of partnership between Amazon and Reliance in the future ""depends upon how much bad blood is between them now,"" said Meena.

""It might end up becoming an ego battle between the CEOs of both the companies,"" he said."

This week showed why.

The wealth of Asia's top billionaire fell by about $6.5 billion on Monday after shares in his conglomerate plunged as much as 8.6%, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index, which tracks the world's wealthiest people.

Shares of Reliance Industries dropped in Mumbai after the company posted disappointing earnings late Friday, mainly due to a tough quarter for its giant oil refinery business. Earnings for that unit ""were much weaker than our estimate,"" analysts at Nomura wrote in a research note following the report.

Pretax profit fell 30% over the three months through September compared to a year ago, although other parts of Reliance helped offset the slump in oil, including its retail and technology units, the analysts noted. Reliance stock was little changed Tuesday.

Reliance is one of India's most valuable and recognizable companies. The powerhouse conglomerate — which spans oil, petrochemicals, telecommunications and retail — has been undergoing a shift in focus recently as Ambani, its chairman and CEO, tries to transform it into a global tech giant."

137,2020-09-22 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/tech/facebook-india-hate-speech/index.html,Facebook has more users in India than anywhere else. It's now dealing with a hate speech crisis,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Facebook is facing multiple simultaneous controversies in the United States, particularly around disinformation , hate speech and political bias . But those issues are also playing out — sometimes in more sinister ways — around the world, including a country where Facebook has more users than anywhere else.

In recent weeks, the company has repeatedly come under fire for its actions and policies in India, a country increasingly important to its business as it's locked out of China and looks for future growth.

Facebook on Wednesday appealed to India's Supreme Court to exempt it from facing a New Delhi government committee investigating the company's alleged role in religious riots in the city earlier this year. The committee said Facebook declined to appear, arguing that regulating tech platforms is under the ""exclusive authority"" of India's national government.

""[The] refusal to appear before this committee is an attempt to conceal crucial facts in relation to Facebook's role in the February 2020 Delhi communal riots,"" the committee's chairman said during a hearing last week. ""This shows that Facebook has something to hide.""

The court ruled on Wednesday that Facebook's India representatives would not be required to appear before the Delhi committee until October 15.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

It's the second time this month that Facebook has come under scrutiny from authorities in India.

The company's representatives were also questioned about allegations of hate speech and political bias by an Indian parliamentary committee earlier this month, with the head of the committee, opposition politician Shashi Tharoor, tweeting that they had ""unanimously agreed to resume the discussion later.""

Facebook said after the hearing that it would ""remain committed to be an open and transparent platform.""

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Facebook allowed a politician from India's ruling party to remain on its platform even though his anti-Muslim posts flouted its rules against hate speech. The Journal cited current and former employees as saying Facebook's public policy head in India, Ankhi Das, opposed removing the politician because doing so would hurt its business interests in the country.

Facebook finally banned the politician, Raja Singh, earlier this month. ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove his account,"" a company spokesperson told CNN Business.

India is one of Facebook's most important markets, where it has more users than anywhere else in the world. The company has rushed to cash in on India's digital boom in recent years, with more than 600 million internet users in the country and nearly an equal number yet to come online.

Earlier this year, Facebook poured $5.7 billion — one of its biggest investments ever — into an internet company owned by India's richest man. And India became the first country to get its new video service, Instagram Reels, in late June, days after the Indian government banned rival app TikTok amid a military dispute with China, home to TikTok's parent company.

Despite the importance of the country to its business prospects, Facebook's tenure in India has been marked by a series of controversies and clashes with authorities. In 2016, the Indian government blocked Free Basics , Facebook's plan to offer free internet access to millions of Indians, on the grounds that it went against the principles of an open internet. More recently, Facebook has pushed back against the government's demand to make messages on its mobile service WhatsApp traceable after a series of viral rumors that led to over a dozen lynchings in 2018, arguing that breaking encryption would compromise the platform's privacy.

The company is also in discussions with the government over proposed regulations that would impose restrictions on how tech companies can store and process Indian data.

Facebook's actions -— and missteps — in India are illustrative of the issues the company faces outside its home country, particularly in non-Western emerging markets. In an internal memo obtained by BuzzFeed News , a former Facebook data scientist outlined several instances when the company was slow to clamp down on abuse of its platform by politicians in countries such as Honduras, Azerbaijan and several others.

The memo reportedly mentioned a network of ""more than a thousand actors"" working to influence local elections in New Delhi in February.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business, but told BuzzFeed News its teams had taken down more than 100 networks around the world for abusing its platform.

""Working against coordinated inauthentic behavior is our priority, but we're also addressing the problems of spam and fake engagement,"" Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois told BuzzFeed News. ""We investigate each issue carefully... before we take action or go out and make claims publicly as a company.""

Facebook has faced accusations of failing to adequately curb hate speech in several of India's neighbors, including Sri Lanka and Myanmar , where the company acknowledged two years ago that it was ""too slow"" to prevent the spread of ""hate and misinformation"" that led to widespread violence against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority.

Facebook has previously shown a tendency to take action in the developing world only when faced with questions from international media or global agencies such as the United Nations, said Nikhil Pahwa, founder of Indian tech news website MediaNama and a digital activist who was at the forefront of India's 2016 fight against Free Basics.

""Historically, platforms tend to act late. They tend to first allow a problem to develop and then respond to that problem instead of acting on it in the first instance,"" Pahwa, who testified in front of both the parliamentary and Delhi committees, told CNN Business. ""At some point in time they have to be held accountable for not acting, and I think we're coming to a situation across the globe where that is becoming a cause for concern.""

India's status as Facebook's biggest market by users, as well as the Indian government's increasing willingness to place restrictions on foreign companies that don't comply with its rules, mean it has to walk a tightrope in the country. And with the current issues around hate speech, the company's own policies make that balance even more delicate.

""Political leaders are influential speakers and are especially dangerous when they incite violence. Unfortunately they also control companies' access to markets, and India is a big market for Facebook,"" said Chinmayi Arun, a fellow at Yale Law School whose work focuses on internet governance. ""The company needs to work out how to stay committed to its policies against incitement to violence, despite the risks to its business that come from antagonizing political leaders,"" she added.

Several of the problems that Facebook is grappling with in the United States have existed for much longer in developing countries, said Mishi Choudhary, co-founder and legal director of New York-based tech advocacy group Software Freedom Law Center. Choudhary cited the company's track record in countries like Brazil , Myanmar and more recently in Cambodia as examples of the company's ""lackadaisical approach"" outside the West.

""Problems that have been rampant in the Global South were constantly being ignored by Facebook until the 2016 US elections,"" she said. ""They love patronizing us and play feel good stories about connecting the world.""

Choudhary and Pahwa both say Facebook's issues in India are symptomatic of a larger global debate on how accountable tech companies are for content on their platforms — a debate that is also playing out in the United States . Facebook, Twitter and other social networks' status as intermediaries allows them to facilitate speech without being held liable for what is said.

But the Indian government is now trying to change that. Proposed amendments to the country's technology laws would force social networks and messaging platforms to trace individual messages that the government deems a threat. The proposed changes also require that social networks such as Facebook and Twitter take down ""unlawful"" content within 24 hours.

""When you are consciously choosing to not act on repeated violations, which are leading to harm, then it's a choice you're making, and somewhere law is going to catch up with you,"" said Pahwa. ""The gap between responsibility and liability is going to get filled with regulation. And that's what's happening right now.""

S&P Global Ratings said in a new report that a ""solid recovery isn't likely"" until 2023 -- and that's based on a widely available vaccine becoming available in the second half of 2021. Covid-19 has suppressed demand for travel this year as lockdowns snarled cities and reduced both business and leisure travel.

140,2020-10-27 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/27/economy/airlines-pandemic-recession-impact/index.html,Airlines will struggle long after passengers feel safe to fly again,"New York (CNN Business) The Covid-19 pandemic has caused the worst financial crisis in the history of the airline industry. But when the health crisis is over, airlines' financial problems will probably continue for years.

History has shown clearly that it takes a tremendous amount of time for passenger traffic to recover after a recession

Most recently, it took a whopping five years after Great Recession ended in 2009 for passenger traffic to recover, according to Philip Baggaley, the chief credit analyst for airlines at Standard & Poors. Even after the relatively mild 2000 recession caused by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, it took until 2004 for US air passenger traffic to again reach its pre-recession peak.

""Recessions are tough for the industry. Airlines are dependent on economic growth,"" said Baggaley.

Beyond the years it takes for overall air travel to recover after a recession, historically it takes even longer for a return of business travel , which is the most lucrative sector for airlines -- one most of themdepend upon.

That's one part of what makes this recession particularly chilling for airlines. On an overall scale the pandemic has caused widespread economic pain, with millions losing their jobs and burning through savings that they might otherwise have used for discretionary spending like vacations.

But when it comes to that all-important business travel, the situation is arguably worse.

Many companies have fewer employees on payrolls with a need to travel. Most will also be trying to recoup losses or pay down debt caused by the pandemic -- and trimming travel by skipping conferences and meeting with clients virtually is likely to be a cost-cutting measure. And, of course, there are many companies that have gone out of business altogether during the crisis.

""Business travel typically falls farther and takes longer to recover,"" said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics.

Sacks thinks next year's travel will still be significantly affected by the pandemic itself. But he said he believes that in ""2022, we're dealing with picking up the pieces from the economy that has been damaged.""

""In this case, I think four years [after 2021] is what we're looking at to get leisure travel back to pre-pandemic levels. Businesses will take at least an extra year,"" he added.

There is no blueprint for a crisis like this. The last pandemic on this global scale was more than 100 years ago in 1918, before the age of commercial air travel.

More recent pandemics -- such as the SARS crisis in 2003, which badly damaged air travel to and from Asia, particularly Hong Kong -- did not cause a global recession. The SARS pandemic was over relatively quickly, and the impact on air travel ended only six months later, Sacks said, as people felt safe flying again.

What airline executives are saying

American AAL United UAL Alaska Air ALK In this pandemic, US airlines collectively lost $12 billion in the second quarter. So far for the third quarter the five largest carriers --, Delta, Southwest and, have already reported losses of $8.9 billion excluding special items like $25 billion in federal assistance for the industry overall.

And airline executives have been blunt about their expectations for a slow, painful recovery.

Southwest LUV ""We have to assume that business travel will be lighter for a long time,"" saidCEO Gary Kelly in an interview on CNBC last week.

He cited examples of business travel taking five years to recover from past recessions, adding, ""you've got to believe that will be at least the case now. I've said it may be 10 years before business travel recovers.""

The airlines are also concerned about a permanent hit to business travel given growing use of video services, although they say they believe the shift to virtual meetings will be limited.

Delta DAL ""I'm of the view that it will have some impact, but it's not going to be a substitute,"" saidCEO Ed Bastian when speaking with investors earlier this month. ""I don't think anybody knows. My sense is that we could be looking at anywhere from 10% to 20% reduction in the next couple of years when we get to that new normal of business travel.""

Most of the financial damage to the airlines so far has been because of a combination of shutdown orders limiting nonessential flying, quarantine rules for travelers and border closings. Travel through US airport checkpoints since March is down 75%.

While those losses may not be repeated -- especially if the vaccines and treatments help to beat back the pandemic sometime next year -- they still have left an industry that went into the crisis in relatively strong financial shape with much weaker balance sheets. All have taken on massive levels of debt to ride out this downturn.

costs. If even a modest level of traffic returns next year with an end to the pandemic, the losses could end by the middle of 2021. But that doesn't mean they'll be in good financial shape. And they've all cut their staff -- through voluntary buyouts and in many cases involuntary layoffs and furloughs -- to reducecosts. If even a modest level of traffic returns next year with an end to the pandemic, the losses could end by the middle of 2021. But that doesn't mean they'll be in good financial shape.

""The airlines may be able to break even again or make modest amounts of money,"" said Baggaley. ""But even if they're able to make money at this lower passenger levels, profitability won't return to previous levels any time soon."""

But the International Monetary Fund is downgrading its forecasts for next year, and warning of a long, slow recovery that will stoke poverty and damage growth.

The IMF predicted on Tuesday that the world economy will shrink by 4.4% in 2020, a less severe contraction than it forecast in June. The improvement is driven by a stronger than expected bounce in the United States and Europe after lockdowns lifted, as well as China's return to growth

However, the organization downgraded its outlook for 2021. The IMF now sees a 5.2% increase in global output next year, down from 5.4% in its previous report. Last month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also lowered its forecast for 2021.

""The ascent out of this calamity is likely to be long, uneven, and highly uncertain,"" IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post.

Output in advanced economies, as well as emerging markets — with the exception of China — is projected to remain below 2019 levels next year, she said.

Joseph Stiglitz is a professor at Columbia University and a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Covid-19 has not been an equal opportunity virus: It goes after people in poor health and those whose daily lives expose them to greater contact with others. And this means it goes disproportionately after the poor, especially in poor countries and in advanced economies like the United States where access to health care is not guaranteed.

Around the world, there are marked differences in how the pandemic has been managed, both in terms of how successful countries have been in maintaining the health of their citizens and the economy and in the magnitude of the inequalities on display.

There are many reasons for these differences: the preexisting state of health care and health inequalities; a country's preparedness and the resiliency of the economy; the quality of public response, including reliance on science and expertise; citizens' trust in government guidance; and how citizens balanced their individual ""freedoms"" to do as they pleased with their respect for others, recognizing that their actions generated externalities. Researchers will spend years parsing the strength of various effects.

Still, two countries illustrate likely lessons that will emerge. If the United States represents one extreme, perhaps New Zealand represents the other. It's a country in which competent government relied on science and expertise to make decisions, a country where there is a high level of social solidarity — citizens recognize that their behavior affects others — and trust, including trust in government.

New Zealand has managed to bring the disease under control and is working to redeploy some underused resources to build the kind of economy that should mark the post-pandemic world: one that is greener and more knowledge-based, with even greater equality, trust, and solidarity. There is a natural dynamic at work. These positive attributes can build on each other. Likewise, there can be adverse, destructive attributes that weigh down a society, leading to less inclusiveness and more polarization

Unfortunately, as bad as inequality had been before the pandemic, and as forcefully as the pandemic has exposed the inequalities in our society, the post-pandemic world could experience even greater inequalities unless governments do something. The reason is simple: Covid-19 won't go away quickly. And the fear of another pandemic will linger. Now it is more likely that both the private and the public sectors will take the risks to heart. And that means certain activities, certain goods and services and certain production processes will be viewed as riskier and costlier.

While robots do get viruses, they are more easily managed. So it is likely that robots will, where possible, at least at the margin, replace humans. ""Zooming"" will, at least at the margin, replace airline travel. The pandemic broadens the threat from automation to low-skilled, person-to-person services workers that the literature so far has seen as less affected — for example, in education and health. All of this will mean that the demand for certain types of labor will decrease. This shift will almost surely increase inequality — accelerating, in some ways, trends already in place.

New economy, new rules

The easy answer is to accelerate upskilling and training in tandem with the changing job market.

But there are good reasons to believe that these steps alone will not suffice. There will need to be a comprehensive program to reduce income inequality.

We need a comprehensive rewriting of the rules of the economy. For instance, we need monetary policies that focus more on ensuring full employment of all groups and not just on inflation; bankruptcy laws that are better balanced, replacing those that became too creditor-friendly and provided too little accountability for bankers who engaged in predatory lending; and corporate governance laws that recognize the importance of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. The rules governing globalization must do more than just serve corporate interests; workers and the environment have to be protected. Labor legislation needs to do a better job of protecting workers and providing greater scope for collective action.

But all of this will not, in the short run at least, create the equality and solidarity that we need. We will need to improve not just the market distribution of income but how we redistribute as well. Perversely, some countries with the highest degree of market income inequalities, like the United States, actually have regressive tax systems where top earners pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than workers lower down the ladder.

Over the past decade, the International Monetary Fund has recognized the importance of equality in promoting good economic performance (including growth and stability). Markets on their own pay no attention to the broader impacts that arise from decentralized decisions leading to excessive borrowing in foreign-denominated currencies or excessive inequality.

The rules are now shaping many aspects of economies' responses to Covid-19. In some countries, the rules encouraged shortsightedness and inequalities, two features of societies that have not managed Covid-19 well. Those countries were inadequately prepared for the pandemic; they built global supply chains that were insufficiently resilient.

When Covid-19 hit, for instance, American firms couldn't even provide enough supplies of simple things like masks and gloves, let alone more complicated products like tests and ventilators.

International dimensions

Covid-19 has exposed and exacerbated inequalities between countries just as it has within countries. The least developed economies have poorer health conditions, health systems that are less prepared to deal with the pandemic and people living in conditions that make them more vulnerable to contagion, and they simply do not have the resources that advanced economies have to respond to the economic aftermath. The pandemic won't be controlled until it is controlled everywhere, and the economic downturn won't be tamed until there is a robust global recovery.

That's why it's a matter of self-interest — as well as a humanitarian concern — for the developed economies to provide the assistance the developing economies and emerging markets need. Without it, the global pandemic will persist longer than it otherwise would, global inequalities will grow and there will be global divergence.

While the Group of Twenty announced that it would use every instrument available to provide this kind of help, the aid so far has been insufficient. In particular, one instrument used in 2009 and easily available has not been employed: an issuance of $500 billion in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). So far, it has not been possible to overcome the lack of enthusiasm of the United States or India. The provision of SDRs would be of enormous assistance to developing economies and emerging markets — with no or little cost to the taxpayers of developed economies. It would be even better if those economies contributed their SDRs to a trust fund to be used by developing economies to meet the exigencies of the pandemic.

So too, the rules of the game affect not just economic performance and inequalities within countries, but also between countries, and in this arena the rules and norms governing globalization are central. Some countries seem committed to ""vaccine nationalism."" Others, like Costa Rica, are doing what they can to ensure that all knowledge relevant to addressing Covid-19 is used for the entire world, in a manner analogous to how the flu vaccine is updated every year.

The pandemic is likely to bring about a rash of debt crises. Low interest rates combined with financial markets in advanced economies pushing loans and profligate borrowing in emerging market and developing economies have left several countries with more debt than they can service, given the magnitude of the pandemic-induced downturn. International creditors, especially private creditors, should know by now that you can't squeeze water out of stone. There will be a debt restructuring. The only question is whether it will be orderly or disorderly.

While the pandemic has revealed the enormous cleavages across the countries of the world, the pandemic itself is likely to increase disparities, leaving long-lasting scars, unless there is a greater demonstration of global and national solidarity. International institutions, like the IMF, have provided global leadership, acting in exemplary ways.

As evidence of the disparate outcomes becomes clear, hopefully there will be a change of course. The pandemic is likely to be with us for a while and its economic aftermath for a much longer time. It's still not too late for such a change of course."

After months of being ignored by recruiters in her home country of South Africa, the economics graduate began using a recruitment website called Giraffe. Compared to the experience of being ""ghosted"" by other recruiters, Zondani says getting guidance every step of the way was like ""a breath of fresh air,"" and she eventually landed a job with an insurance company.

Zondani knows she is one of the lucky ones in the current economic climate. South Africa was already in recession and struggling with record-high unemployment before the pandemic. In 2019, it had the world's highest youth unemployment rate, at 56% , and Covid-19 has led to even more job losses

But Giraffe believes it can help those hit the hardest: unskilled and less educated workers. Founded in 2015 by Anish Shivdasani and Shafin Anwarsha, Giraffe has automated the recruitment process, from sourcing candidates to screening them.

Where jobseekers would usually apply for positions on paper or in person, they can now upload their résumé to the online platform, and an algorithm will match them with relevant jobs.

Giraffe was built for mobile devices, which is how most South Africans primarily access the internet, explains Shivdasani. Smartphone penetration in the country has doubled from 2016 to 91% in 2019. Of those with internet access, around 60% use a mobile device.

While other job portals and recruitment agencies often target high-skilled jobseekers, Shivdasani says Giraffe's focus is primarily on entry to mid-level jobs.

""We really target the mass segment of the market,"" Shivdasani tells CNN Business. ""We define it as salaries between 3,000 and 25,000 rand ($177 to $1,470) a month.""

This income range represents about two-thirds of the total South African workforce, he adds.

Shivdasani and Anwarsha met while working as strategy consultants in the telecoms industry. Shivdasani says he had always dreamed of building a platform to solve social problems in South Africa. In brainstorming where to start, he realized that unemployment was at the core of many of them. ""We felt that unemployment is probably the biggest problem in South Africa,"" he says.

Giraffe is completely free for jobseekers, explains Shivdasani, and instead charges businesses to post jobs on its platform.

Facebook FB Google GOOG It has worked with about 3,000 businesses and currently has one million jobseekers registered on its platform. Shivdasani estimates Giraffe reaches approximately 10 million jobseekers through partnerships withand

Giraffe has even developed a voice note function that lets companies listen to applicants answering questions before inviting them to interview. ""It's a combination of matching, screening and voice clips, which sets us apart from other platforms,"" Shivdasani says.

This year the company received a grant from UNICEF , which it will use to build a content portal to arm jobseekers with career advice. Giraffe declined to disclose the amount of funding it received.

South Africa's structural challenges

Vimal Ranchhod, an economics professor at the University of Cape Town, says skills development with the help of platforms like Giraffe is one way to assist young people."

The summit included 40 government ministers from countries around the world, representing 80% of global energy use and emissions. Its aim was to set out plans to reduce global emissions while also boosting economic recovery after Covid-19.

Guterres commended governments that have committed to green recovery plans, citing the EU, South Korea, Nigeria and Canada.

149,2020-10-31 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/31/china/grandma-wong-hong-kong-protest-dst-intl-hnk/index.html,Grandma Wong was a key figure in Hong Kong's protest movement -- until she disappeared,"(CNN) With her gray hair and huge British flag, 64-year-old Alexandra Wong was a striking figure on the frontlines of last year's pro-democracy protests -- until she disappeared.

Affectionately nicknamed Grandma Wong by other protesters, she attended nearly every demonstration last year, commuting from the nearby mainland city of Shenzhen, where she moved to 14 years ago.

Her presence for many symbolized how political dissatisfaction in Hong Kong cut across age groups, even if those on the streets were most often young people dressed in black. Her flag was an incendiary taunt implying to many that the city was governed better under British colonial rule than Chinese.

Last month after a long absence, Wong resurfaced in Hong Kong, alleging that she had been detained in mainland China for 14 months by the authorities there.

She says that late one night in August last year, after being discharged from a Hong Kong hospital where she was treated for injuries sustained when riot police stormed a subway station, she was prevented from entering Shenzhen.

""I (was) frightened, I feel my hand was shaking,"" she says.

Alexandra Wong poses next to the government headquarter's driveways in Hong Kong, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Umbrella Movement.

Wong says that after being held for 24 hours at the border, she was sent to two detention centers, before being released on bail for a year. ""(I was) so frightened every second,"" she says of the ordeal.

Wong, who claims she did not have access to a lawyer throughout the process, says the Chinese authorities questioned her about her role in the protests, repeatedly asking: ""Why do you fly your British flag? You are Chinese."" She says she was threatened with 10 years imprisonment if she didn't talk. Wong says she told the authorities she always protested alone, and never joined a political organization or protest group.

The Chinese authorities did not reply to CNN's request for comment.

A protester is born

Wong wasn't interested in politics growing up. She says she had even felt patriotic to the mainland, where both her parents were born and had fled from to Hong Kong during the second Sino-Japanese War.

But all that changed for Wong in 1989.

She had only recently returned to Hong Kong from Vienna, Austria, where she had been studying music, when soldiers opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. ""I felt really sad when I saw the bloody scenes on television,"" she says. ""The bloodiness and chaos stuck with me, so did the protesters' reluctance to leave (Tiananmen Square)."" When Hong Kongers took to the streets in solidarity with the victims, Wong joined them. It was her first protest -- and sparked a lifetime of political activism.

She later spent a decade drifting through jobs in Austria and Hawaii, before working for an NGO in mainland China. ""Gradually, I started to compare these places with Hong Kong: Why in some places people live so happily, and places like the countryside on the mainland are so miserable?"" she says.

Activist Alexandra Wong waves a British Union Jack flag during a gathering outside the government headquarters to mark the fourth anniversary of mass pro-democracy rallies, known as the Umbrella Movement, in Hong Kong on September 28, 2018.

In 2006, Wong bought a 29-square-meter (312-square-foot) flat in Shenzhen for 90,000 yuan ($13,447) at auction. In Hong Kong, she says an apartment of that size would have cost close to 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($129,000), depending on the location. ""The longer I lived in Shenzhen, the more I felt something was not right with the mainland, and the more I hoped I could do something to safeguard Hong Kong. I began going back to Hong Kong more and more often,"" she says.

In Hong Kong, the inoffensive-looking, gray-haired flag-flying Wong became a fixture of the city's pro-democracy movement, first at its initial Occupy Central movement in late 2011. Wong later joined the protests against the national education curriculum in 2012, which launched the political career of activist Joshua Wong, and was regularly photographed at the Umbrella movement of 2014, which shut down a central thoroughfare of the city for months. She often camped out on the street for several nights in a row.

Pro-democracy protester Alexandra Wong, nicknamed Grandma Wong, who disappeared midway through the city's democracy protests in 2019 and resurfaced in Hong Kong two days ago after 14 months away, posing for a photo in her hotel room in Hong Kong.

Her appearances during that movement earned her the moniker Grandma Wong, although she is neither a grandma or a mother. The term speaks to her figure as an older member of society who has a broader perspective on the city's history, and future.

""I want to tell the middle-aged and old people to come out, (and) stand with the young people together,"" Wong says. ""I must take care of the young people.""

Captured in China

As the pro-democracy protests swept Hong Kong last summer, frequently erupting into violence, for many crossing the city's busy border with Shenzhen became increasingly sensitive. In August, British consulate worker and regular protester Simon Cheung was detained at the border for 15 days. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he had been held for violating China's Security Administration Punishment Law, which covers a range of offenses deemed too minor to be crimes.

Reports emerged of people's phones being checked for materials related to the protests. This October, a Taiwanese man who disappeared after crossing from Hong Kong into Shenzhen last August turned up on Chinese state media. State broadcaster CCTV aired footage of Lee Meng-chu in a prison uniform, apologizing for endangering Chinese national security. China accused Lee of taking photos of Chinese troops on the border and protesters in Hong Kong. It is not clear if Lee's confession was made under duress.

Wong says she was also detained in August as she tried to cross the border back into Shenzhen.

Attendees from various forces stand next to a banner supporting the new national security law during a flag-raising ceremony to mark China's National Day celebrations early morning in Hong Kong on July 1, 2020.

Officers told her she was charged with ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble."" She says she didn't tell her family what had happened to her, for fear of getting them into trouble.

Wong was sent to a detention center where she shared a cell with 16 women -- she says they all shared a bed. The women were monitored by police officers 24 hours a day via a small window, and the washing area at one end of the room had two security cameras, she says.

""(There was) no privacy,"" she adds.

The hardest part was the sleep deprivation, she says. ""(They) never turn the lights off,"" she says. ""I could not sleep well. Every day, only three or four hours on average.""

Wong was released on bail after signing a confession, and taken on a five-day patriotic tour of Xi'an, in central China. Accompanied by three national security police officers, she says she had to wave the national flag, sing the national anthem, and watch a film. They told her to respect the Chinese flag.

She was then told she could not leave Shenzhen for one year.

""The national security policemen (would) come to my own apartment, or they called me to the small police station,"" she says. ""Sometimes they scared me at that police station.""

After her bail period ended, she says she had to wrangle with officials for several days to get a bail completion certificate. When she finally received it on October 2, she hurriedly packed her belongings and went straight to the border with Hong Kong.

Back in Hong Kong

When Wong was finally able to cross into Hong Kong last month, it was a huge relief, she says. ""That moment (of returning) was really, really happy,"" she says. ""But I did feel sorrow, because the Hong Kong policemen (could) immediately bring me back to the police station ... it's possible.""

While she was in the mainland, Hong Kong had changed -- in June, Beijing imposed a national security law on the city, which has made it easier to punish protesters and reduced the city's autonomy.

Now living in temporary accommodation in Hong Kong, she is trying to catch up with the events of the past year and is enjoying being able to read the news without Chinese online censorship, as she works out her next steps. Wong says she won't return to mainland China unless the political system changes.

A protester is seen carrying a flag that says ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,"" an act that could now be considered a crime under the city's new national security law.

She also says she will not stop protesting. She even wears a necktie embossed with the words ""liberate Hong Kong"" -- a popular protest slogan that has now been effectively outlawed by the national security law, as it is deemed as supporting separatism.

This week, she was at the court house in Hong Kong to support Tony Chung, the first public political figure to face charges under the national security law, and she has publicly supported 12 young people who were arrested on the mainland trying to flee Hong Kong by boat for Taiwan earlier this year.

Wong is urging other young people who can leave legally to try to start a life elsewhere. She says it's too late for an ""old woman"" like her to do the same -- so she will stay to fight. ""I want to protect the young people,"" she said, so they can ""emigrate to other countries.""

All of this may attract the ire of the Hong Kong authorities but it is a risk she says she is willing to take.

""It's impossible for me to be quiet,"" she says. ""I'm ready to go to jail again."""

During an inspection of the People's Liberation Army Marine Corps in Chaozhou City, Xinhua said Xi told the soldiers to ""maintain a state of high alert"" and called on them to be ""absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable.""

The main purpose of Xi's visit to Guangdong was to deliver a speech Wednesday commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which was established in 1980 to attract foreign capital and played a vital role in helping China's economy become the second-largest in the world.

But the military visit comes as tensions between China and the United States remain at their highest point in decades, with disagreements over Taiwan and the coronavirus pandemic creating sharp divisions between Washington and Beijing.

The White House notified US Congress Monday that it was planning to move ahead with the sale of three advanced weapon systems to Taiwan, according to a congressional aide, including the advanced High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)."

Shanghai officials are asking residents to report food-wasting behaviors. Food industry bosses are urging diners to order at least one fewer dish than the number of people in their group. And one restaurant in southern Hunan province even asked diners to weigh themselves before entering, to help them choose appropriate meals.

Like many countries around the world, China has a massive problem with food waste. In 2015, the country tossed enough to feed at least 30 to 50 million people -- the populations of Australia and New Zealand combined, or the state of Texas -- for an entire year, according to Chinese state media

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the campaign to tackle what he called the ""shocking and distressing"" problem of food waste on August 11, state-run news agency Xinhua said. His message came as the Covid-19 outbreak disrupted global food supply chains.

But his directive lacked specifics, leaving it up to zealous officials and citizens across the nation to engineer sometimes drastic methods to tackle the issue.

Customers weigh themselves in the popular Hunan restaurant chain Chuiyan Fried Beef, in the city of Changsha. Signs around the restaurant say ""clean your plate"" and ""be thrifty and diligent.""

More strict measures are to come. China's top legislative body has announced it will look into passing laws against food waste, while major streaming platforms have threatened food bloggers with potential bans for overeating online.

Food is a sensitive topic in China, where a famine that saw 45 million people starve to death during the 1950s and 60s remains within living memory for many. Being able to eat what they want, when they want is seen by many as a sign of China's new wealth, and the world second-largest economy has a culture that has communal eating at its heart.

Experts warned that monitoring meal times could be seen as one intrusion too far into citizens' increasingly surveilled personal lives.

""Three meals a day is something very personal to the ordinary people,"" said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing and former political science professor at Tsinghua University. ""Even the most politically apathetic person can feel their daily life habits challenged and threatened (by this campaign).""

Food and wealth

When the government withdrew food vouchers in 1993, it was a powerful symbol that the days of food shortages were over, with people free to eat as they chose. As China's economy opened up to the world, the country's new wealth was conveyed on dining tables through luxury items such as shark's fin and bird's nest soup. ""Eating and drinking to one's heart's content is the symbol that people are living a good life,"" said Wu.

Multi-course banquets are routinely used to celebrate birthdays and weddings, as well as holidays such as the Chinese New Year, with dish quantity and elaborate ingredients signifying wealth. Alfred Wu Muluan, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, explained that ordering an abundance of dishes is a often ""question of face"" -- the more a person orders, he said, the more status and respect they will have.

But that has also contributed to huge amounts of waste. According to state-run media, between 2013 and 2015 China wasted about 18 million tons of food each year.

When China's huge population of 1.4 billion people is considered, that's better than some Western nations. Per capita, China wastes about 72.4 pounds of food a year, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2018 Food Sustainability Index. Australia tosses out 168 pounds of food every year per capita, while the United States is ranked lowest on the index at 209 pounds of food annually.

But it's still too much. A report on China's food waste published by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 2015, and quoted in state media after Xi's announcement, said the worst culprit for lost produce in China was the country's growing catering industry, and that the problem is worst in large cities.

""How can restaurants restrict customers from ordering more food? Restaurant owners all want to have good business.""Mr Wang, Wuhan resident and former restauranteur

""Beijing city generates 18,000 tonnes of domestic garbage per day, in which a huge amount of unconsumed foods including bread, sandwiches, fast food, large pieces of fish and meat, and unopened bags of rice can be easily found,"" the report said.

But asking restaurants to serve less food in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed restaurants for much of the first half of this year, is controversial.

Wang, a Wuhan resident whose restaurant shut down due to the lockdown during the Covid-19 outbreak, said China's food industry was still struggling to recover from the epidemic, and now faced pressure to serve less food.

""How can restaurants restrict customers from ordering more food?"" he said. ""Restaurant owners all want to have good business,"" he said. Wang asked to keep his first name private for fear of an official backlash for speaking out.

Growing surveillance

Some Chinese citizens have been frustrated by what they see as yet another political limitation on their everyday lives.

In recent years, the government has tightened controls on internet usage, censoring political discussion and actively tracking people's digital footprint. More than 20 million surveillance cameras had been installed in China by 2017, according to state broadcaster CCTV , with facial recognition technology able to track the movements of citizens across the nation. And authorities still regulate which city people can live in with access to health care, and the number of children couples can have.

Until the new campaign, eating was ""one of the few things people can freely do under China's authoritarian system,"" said Wu, the political analyst.

Earlier this month, state-run media reported that a district government in Harbin city, Heilongjiang province, had set up a "" food waste exposure system "" for government canteens, installing surveillance cameras near food collection bins into which workers scrape their leftovers.

Those caught on camera with food waste more than three times will be named and shamed, with footage of their ""crimes"" to be played on television screens across the canteens.

A sign encouraging people not to waste food is seen at a restaurant in Handan in China's northern Hebei province on August 13.

Some local governments have expanded their surveillance of food waste to entire cities, with Shanghai encouraging citizens to report each other if they saw someone eating too much or wasting food. The punishments for this offense were not specified in the announcement.

""Why should I be reported for things I bought with my own money?"" one social media commentator said about the new regulations on food consumption, comparing it to the political supervision during Mao's era.

When a catering association in Liaoning province in northeastern China announced a rule that people should eat N-2 dishes, or two dishes less than the number of people dining, it was met with ridicule online. ""I want to know which city will roll out a 'N-3' rule next?"" a comment on Chinese social media asked.

""Even the most politically apathetic person can feel their daily life habits challenged and threatened (by this campaign)""Wu Qiang, Beijing political analyst

Online food bloggers who binge eat for their viewers' enjoyment have also been heavily criticized by state-run media. Major video platforms such as Douyin -- China's version of TikTok -- have pledged to monitor food-related livestreams and shut down accounts that broadcast binge eating.

Langweixian once ate 10 packets of instant noodles in under nine minutes, Langweixian, a binge-eating vlogger on Douyin with 40 million followers, had all but six of his 300-plus videos deleted from the platform.Langweixian once ate 10 packets of instant noodles in under nine minutes, according to state media.

""Lang, I support you. It is your right to upload videos of yourself eating. Personally I don't agree with eating so much at a time ... but it's your right. You didn't break the law and shouldn't be subjected to the crackdown,"" a fan said in the comment section.

Agricultural crisis

Xi's anti-food waste campaign comes as China's agriculture sector is reeling from a series of natural disasters.

Before Covid-19 hit, the country was already dealing with another epidemic: swine fever. Pork is a staple in many parts of China, making up around 70% of China's total meat consumption, according to official data for 2018. On average, a person in China eats 20 kilograms of pork each year.

But the widespread outbreak in 2019 devastated the country's pig farms. Analysis of the official data by CNN Business in November 2019 estimated that the country's pig population had shrunk by about 40%, or 130 million pigs.

China has mostly contained the virus, but the pandemic continues to disrupt global supply chains, and Beijing's ongoing trade war with Washington has jeopardized imports of soy beans and other food products.

A Chinese woman wears a protective mask as she sits in a nearly empty restaurant at a shopping mall on March 26 during coronavirus restrictions in Beijing, China.

Meanwhile, record flooding along the Yangze River this spring has decimated rice and corn crops in central China, forcing Beijing to release tens of millions of tons of food from government storage.

Amid all that, Xi has emphasized the need for China to be be self-sufficient in food production. Last month, while touring Jilin province , Xi spoke to farmers and called for local authorities to prioritize food security.

Chinese state media, however, has been quick to stress the country is not running out of food

Grain stores in China are ""exceeding demand,"" according to the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, which quoted one expert saying the priority is now ""destocking"" excess supplies.

'People will forget'

While measures to tackle food waste in China are long overdue, some have questioned whether the government's broad call to simply waste less will achieve this.

Ma Jun, director of environmental advocacy group the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs, said the government's policy push could be better targeted, adding it would be more appropriate for Beijing to enforce specific rules on waste restrictions at government agencies and public institutions, for example, than to restrict how much individual consumers can order at restaurants.

""For the general public, it is better to raise their awareness (on food waste) and change social customs through advocacy ... rather than compulsory measures,"" he said.

Willy Lam, from the Center of China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in addition to the challenges presented by the vagueness of Xi's policy, this was a particularly bad time to implement the campaign, right after the social hardships imposed by the coronavirus lockdowns, when millions of Chinese were unable to leave their homes for months.

All many people want to do now, Lam said, was go to restaurants, eat and enjoy themselves. ""So this frugality goal might be difficult to achieve,"" he said.

experts say they don't expect Xi's latest crackdown on food waste to last long. They point to a similar Without more specific guidelines or financial support from Beijing,experts say they don't expect Xi's latest crackdown on food waste to last long. They point to a similar campaign in 2013, which saw minimum order amounts briefly banned in restaurants, Beijing officials trial fines on restaurants and businesses with excess food waste, and, in some areas, restaurants encouraged to serve half-portions.

But without a clear roadmap for longterm change, such measures were slowly forgotten

""The truth is, the implementation won't be very strict,"" said Wu, of the National University of Singapore.

Changing how nearly 1.4 billion people eat is a tall order."
153,2020-08-26 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/asia/sinovac-coronavirus-china-vaccine-intl-hnk/index.html,Inside the company at the forefront of China's push to develop a coronavirus vaccine,"(CNN) Inside the white, sterile walls of a new building on the southern outskirts of Beijing, two employees donning masks and rubber gloves are busy pipetting a clear, colorless liquid into rows of small vials.

In some areas, the interior fit-out is still underway. Outside, construction vehicles are digging up dirt.

The 215,000 square feet (20,000 square meter) production plant was built in recent months specifically for producing a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech.

CoronaVac, the vaccine candidate from Sinovac, is part of China's push to be at the forefront of rolling out immunizations against the deadly novel coronavirus -- and to demonstrate its scientific prowess.

CoronaVac, a Covid-19 vaccine candidate produced by Sinovac Biotech, is one of the six vaccines worldwide that have entered Phase 3 clinical trials.

Scientists globally are racing to find a way to stop to the virus that has infected more than 23 million people and claimed over 800,000 lives. Six vaccine candidates have started Phase 3 clinical trials -- the last step of testing to prove efficacy and safety before seeking approval from regulators -- and three are Chinese.

CoronaVac's last-stage trials are being rolled out in Brazil and Indonesia with about 11,000 volunteers.

""If everything goes well, we hope that we can have some results around the end of the year,"" said Helen Yang, director of investor relations at Sinovac, from the CoronaVac production plant in the Chinese capital's Daxing district.

The Nasdaq-listed biotech company began developing its vaccine in late January, less than a week after Wuhan -- the original epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak -- went into a strict lockdown. Construction of the plant started in March, and Yang said the facility will eventually produce 300 million doses of the vaccine a year, if it is approved by China's National Medical Products Administration.

Engineers work on monkey kidney cells for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing on April 29.

CoronaVac uses an old-fashioned approach -- employing an inactivated whole virus to prompt the body to develop immunity. The virus is grown under controlled conditions and killed chemically, so it cannot replicate to cause disease when injected into the body. This method has long been proven effective with other viruses, and is still used in polio and flu shots, as well as the rabies vaccine.

A Sinovac spokesperson said the company chose an inactivated vaccine because it was most familiar with this approach.

The US is pushing ahead with a newer type of vaccine made using genetic material from the virus. This type of vaccine is faster to produce, because whole samples of a virus do not have to be cultured, but there is less known about which genetic material to choose from the virus to replicate to induce an strong immune response.

To fast-track the preclinical process -- where researchers develop the vaccine candidate and test it on animals -- Yang said the company had conducted several studies in parallel so it could select the best results.

Sinovac has also been working closely with China's equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the approval process. ""Once we complete a certain study, we submit the data ... immediately so they can start to review,"" Yang added.

In May, Sinovac published in the journal Science the results of animal trials, which found that its vaccine induced effective antibodies in mice and rats, as well as primates such as the rhesus macaques. A month later, the company said its Phase 2 trial of 600 volunteers found the vaccine caused the human body to produce antibodies 14 days after vaccination.

But the Phrase 3 trial requires large-scale testing of thousands of participants.

By June, China had largely contained the coronavirus, contending with only small, sporadic outbreaks. China had reported 84,996 Covid-19 cases by Wednesday, with fewer than 2,000 new infections since the start of June -- and more than a third of those were imported, according to the country's National Health Commission (NHC).

Yang said the small number of newly reported Covid-19 cases in China didn't meet the necessary conditions for a Phase 3 trial, so Sinovac reached an agreement with Brazil -- which ranks second in the world for infections, with more than 3.6 million reported cases.

A volunteer receives a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech at the Sao Lucas Hospital, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil on August 08, 2020.

In collaboration with the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, a Phase 3 study was launched in late July involving 9,000 volunteers, all health professionals who have worked with Covid-19 patients but haven't been infected with the virus, according to São Paulo officials.

In exchange, Brazil was promised 120 million doses of the vaccine, if the tests found it to be effective.

The tests are ongoing, but Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute, said Wednesday preliminary data shows CoronaVac induced immunity in 97% of the people vaccinated after two doses -- a level he said was ""fundamental to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus.""

Covas said earlier this month that data on the efficacy of the vaccine could be available by October -- potentially starting the formal approval process in a matter of months. He expects the vaccine to be available to the Brazilian public by January.

""I am very optimistic. I think it would be a reasonable time frame given the performance so far,"" he said at a public hearing at the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.

This month, Sinovac also rolled out another Phase 3 trial in Indonesia with 1,620 volunteers. Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said in a statement Friday that it signed a preliminary agreement with Sinovac for the bulk purchase of 50 million vaccines from November to March 2021, with guaranteed priority access until the end of next year.

A race for vaccine

With the global race for vaccines heating up, Yang down played competition between biotech companies -- saying demand was too huge for a single company to meet.

The real competition, she said, is with the virus.

""Our speed should be faster than the transmission of the virus instead of competing with others. We like everyone to be successful then there will be enough supply to protect people,"" Yang said.

The two other Chinese vaccines to have started Phase 3 trials are being developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, while a vaccine from the United Kingdom, produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has reached this stage, along with two from the United States, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in collaboration with German company BioNTech, and the other by Moderna.

As it stands, 13 companies in China are working on coronavirus vaccines. Of those, nine vaccine candidates are in human trials -- more than in any other country.

Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, said vaccination is key for countries like China where strict measures have helped keep the percentage of infected people in the population low.

""The overall immunity is very low. And so in these places, definitely the way forward is vaccinations,"" he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping learns about the progress on a candidate coronavirus vaccine during his visit to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing on March 2, 2020.

Geopolitical implications

Senior US national security officials have warned of alleged Chinese government attempts to steal coronavirus research from American institutions for months. In July, US prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals accused of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine research on behalf of the government.

China's leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged Chinese scientists to accelerate the research and development of coronavirus vaccines. Xiao Yaqing, the country's former top market regulator, told pharmaceutical companies last month to treat coronavirus vaccine development as an ""important political task.""

Xiao has since been appointed the minister of industry and information technology.

Not only would a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine save lives, deliver scientific prestige and represent a tantalizing opportunity for economic recovery, it could also have significant geopolitical implications.

The Chinese government has faced sharp criticism -- most notably from the US -- for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Its subsequent ""mask diplomacy"" -- an effort to ship medical supplies to countries grappling with Covid-19 -- has fueled suspicion that it is trying to change the coronavirus narrative.

Winning the vaccine race would present China with an opportunity to shore up its global standing by positioning itself as a leader in fighting the pandemic.

Last month, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he had asked Xi to help the Southeast Asian nation get priority access to a Chinese vaccine.

The number of countries granted such access is growing fast. Besides Brazil and Indonesia, which have been approved for early access from Sinovac, Pakistan -- one of China's closest allies -- will receive early vaccine doses from Sinopharm, if its Phase 3 trials are successful.

In a video summit with African leaders in June, Xi pledged that ""once the development and deployment of Covid-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.""

This month, China's ambassador in Afghanistan, Wang Yu, told the Afghanistan Times that ""once China's vaccine is successfully developed and produced, it will be our priority to consider providing the vaccine to Afghan people.""

And on Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would also give priority access to Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.

""Emergency use""

Within China, authorities have rolled out coronavirus vaccines for "" emergency use "" before the last-stage trials are finished.

Last weekend, a senior official from the NHC revealed that China has been using an experimental vaccine on people who work in high-risk professions since July, including front line medical professionals and border inspectors.

The vaccine, developed by Sinopharm, is still in Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Morocco and Argentina.

Zheng Zhongwei, director of the Science and Technology Development Center of the NHC, told China's state broadcaster that the ""emergency use"" of a vaccine during a ""major public health incident"" was in accordance with the country's vaccine law.

It comes after the Chinese government approved the use of a different vaccine candidate for the country's military in June.

However, on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- the top US infectious disease expert -- warned against early emergency use authorization, explaining that such a step could damage efforts to develop other vaccines.

""One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial,"" he said."

Up to 20 guests can fly on a private chartered Fiji Airways jet from Los Angeles to Nadi, Fiji's primary airport and main transit hub. From there, they will be transferred to Laucala, where they will have the private island resort all to themselves.

The few travelers allowed into Fiji at present are subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine, but because of Laucala's remoteness the Department of Health has permitted the program to go forward without guests having to isolate for two weeks.

They will need three negative Covid-19 tests, though -- one two weeks before traveling, one 72 hours before boarding (which will be sent to the tourism authority in order to confirm travel permits) and one upon arrival in Fiji.

Beyond the transportation and hotel, travelers will get to avail themselves of the Private Suite at Los Angeles International Airport -- a posh, personal airport lounge that has been used by celebrities and members of the royal family ahead of their own LAX departures.

On the other side of the itinerary, guests will be able to use the private Fiji Airways lounge in Nadi.

The cost? A cool $490,000 covers the jet, a minimum seven-night stay, on-island activities, food and drink and airport transfers for up to 20 people. If you don't live in L.A., though, you're on your own for getting there.

Laucala's pricey proposition may not work for most tourists. But this isn't the only way that Fiji, whose tourism industry generally comprises 40% of its gross national product (GNP), has tried to make up for lost revenue during the pandemic.

155,,https://cnn.com/travel/article/wok-hei-perfect-fried-rice-hong-kong/index.html,"The science behind 'the breath of a wok,' an essential ingredient in the perfect bowl of fried rice","(CNN) — Chef Kwok Keung Tung tosses the wok with one hand, using the other to stir with a metal spatula.

Both hands occupied, he uses his knee to nudge the gas stove's lever up and down to control the fire fan, sporadically engulfing a third of the wok in flames.

It takes only three minutes for the lump of white rice to transform into the bowl of golden fried rice he places on the serving counter.

""This is what you're looking for -- wok hei (the breath of wok),"" Danny Yip, co-founder of Hong Kong restaurant The Chairman, tells CNN Travel.

""Wok is the essence of Chinese cooking in South China. And Cantonese chefs are the master of fire and wok.""

Wok hei: An invisible but essential ingredient in Cantonese cooking. Maggie Hiufu Wong/CNN

If anyone's an authority on the subject of wok hei, it's Yip.

For those who grew up in a Cantonese family, it's almost impossible to go to a Chinese restaurant without hearing someone -- usually older -- comment ""gau wok hei"" (enough wok hei) or ""ng gau wok hei"" (not enough wok hei) when establishing a benchmark of how authentic a Chinese restaurant actually is.

Hei (also Romanized as ""hay"") is the Cantonese word for ""chi,"" meaning energy flow. It was once a hard-to-explain and largely ethereal concept mostly popular in the South China region. In other parts of China or Asia, even though they used woks, they didn't focus on wok hei.

It wasn't until the legendary American Chinese food writer Grace Young coined it poetically as ""the breath of a wok"" in her book ""The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen: Classic Family Recipes for Celebration and Healing"" in the 1990s that the concept of wok hei was introduced officially to international audiences.

""Wok hei is not simply hot food; it's that elusive seared taste that only lasts for a minute or two,"" Young wrote.

In other words, it's a combination of that steaming aroma you breathe in and the almost-burning sensation on your tongue that somehow enhances the flavors of the dish.

How a wok works

In recent years, an increasing number of food writers and scientists have been modernizing Chinese cooking while looking deeper into its origins, including wok hei.

""Wok hei and the Maillard reaction require high heat. The commercial Chinese stoves have a mind-blowing amount of heat coming out of them,"" explains Ko, who spent months studying how and why chefs toss fried rice with a wok, while also simulating rice trajectories.

The Maillard reaction is a chemical interaction that occurs between amino acids and reducing sugars in food placed under high heat. It causes foods to brown and releases aroma and flavors.

But why does it have to be cooked in high heat and in such a hurry?

""That's how to extract the maximum wok hei in the shortest amount of time. So the aroma you unlocked from the Maillard reaction won't escape,"" explains The Chairman's Yip.

Hence, an important component of wok hei -- apart from the fire and the actual wok -- is the chef's tossing skill.

The right way to toss a wok

Tossing a wok is a skill that takes time to develop.

A young chef at The Chairman spends more than a year practicing on the wok by cooking staff meals before he or she is allowed to stir fry a dish for customers.

""Why don't other chefs use a wok? It's heavy and the fire can be intimidating and hard to control -- now you know why none of the Chinese chefs have any arm hair left,"" says Yip, only half-jokingly.

Why won't stirring suffice? In the case of fried rice, every time it leaves the hot wok surface it cools down and avoids getting burnt, as demonstrated in the above video.

""Tossing the wok allows better mixing, which is essential when you have super high heat. Stirring under high heat will likely lead to burning,"" says Ko.

During Ko's research, he discovered that chefs often pivot their woks using the edge of the stove -- instead of lifting the entire wok away from the stove -- to save energy and increase speed.

Two motions happen simultaneously with each toss: ""Back and forth pushing and pulling"", and ""tilting and rotating the wok back and forth"" in a see-saw motion.

So what makes the round-bottomed and highly conductive wok such a unique piece of cooking equipment?

""Potentially, other utensils would work, too. But you just need to mix at amazing speeds to make sure that the heat is going into your ingredients uniformly,"" explains Ko.

On average, the chefs in the study tossed their wok at a speed of 2.7 times per second.

This is also why many Chinese chefs suffer from muscle injuries.

One of the goals of Ko's study was to see if it's possible to create a robot that could help chefs toss their wok to reduce the physical strain on their limbs. Ko thinks his published research can potentially be applied in other parts of life.

""Can you imagine a laundry drying machine that uses the wok tossing mechanics to toss clothes? My gut feeling is that it will be more efficient -- and funnier,"" says Ko.

How to make perfect fried rice

Fried rice was brought into the spotlight in July, thanks to a viral YouTube video titled ""Uncle Roger DISGUSTED by this Egg Fried Rice Video.""

In the clip, ""Uncle Roger,"" a character created by UK-based Malaysian stand-up comedian Nigel Ng, reacts to a BBC video on how to cook egg fried rice.

He points out everything done wrong in the original egg fried rice video, a response that has gathered more than 17 million views so far. Among the major offenses in the original video? Watery rice.

It's an issue that sits close to the hearts of Hong Kong's chefs.

""Fried rice and fried beef noodles are the two dishes often used to judge the wok hei of a restaurant,"" says Yip. ""It is difficult to get each piece of rice or noodle slightly toasted and mixed evenly with the rest of the ingredients without burning it.""

Ko agrees.

""Fried rice is a very symbolic cuisine,"" he says. ""It is surprisingly hard to make perfect fried rice although it looks really simple. The general principle is to keep it hot -- by avoiding putting in watery content that cools the materials down -- and mix a lot to prevent sticking and burning.""

Ko suggests using rice that's been cooked the night before.

""It goes back to the high heat argument. When you put (dried leftover rice) in the wok, the moisture will be minimal ... that prevents cooling the wok down or the rice from sticking together,"" explains the scientist.

The Chairman, however, does things a bit differently.

""We know most people use leftover rice as it's drier. We don't as we want to keep the inside of the rice moist and retain the most aroma. The trick is to use eggs,"" says Yip.

Kwok, the chef, demonstrates.

He first quickly fries the finely chopped ingredients in the wok, drying them before setting them aside. Then he pours in the oil, egg mixture and rice separately.

""Egg dries faster than rice. The chef has to act fast and mix all the ingredients. See, you don't even see the egg anymore,"" says Yip, hurrying this writer to take a bite before the aroma escapes.

It's true. The slightly toasted and steaming rice is dry on the surface and each grain is perfectly coated in golden yellow -- you don't see the egg anymore. Each bite of the fried rice is still steaming and packed with flavors."

As we began 2020, travelers had more freedom of movement than at any time in history. Air traffic had been rising for decades.

But then in March, the coronavirus pandemic changed life as we know it.

Travel photographers have been capturing the world throughout this strangest of years, sharing their images with those of us unable to venture far beyond our homes.

157,,https://cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-ship-captain-kate-mccue/index.html,What it's like to be a cruise ship captain,"(CNN) — Every evening, whether the Celebrity Edge cruise ship is crisscrossing the Caribbean or meandering around the Mediterranean, Captain Kate McCue writes night orders for her team.

She always includes a note of how many people are on board the ship.

It's important, says McCue, ""to understand the gravity of the responsibility.""

Celebrity Edge is one of Celebrity Cruise Line's largest and swankiest vessels. It cost $1 billion to build and can house almost 3,000 passengers and over 1,000 crew members.

McCue's job is to take charge of this enormous floating city and steer it safely around the world.

Following her early days learning the ropes with Disney Cruise Line, McCue rose through the ranks at Royal Caribbean and moved to Celebrity Cruise Line to captain Celebrity Summit in 2015 -- a promotion that made her the first female US cruise ship captain.

She later moved to Celebrity Equinox and has helmed Celebrity Edge since September 2019.

Today, McCue chats to CNN Travel over video call from her home in Las Vegas, where she recently returned after spending months unexpectedly stuck at sea in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Unexpected choppy waters

Covid-19 brought the cruise industry to a standstill -- virus-hit ships were quarantined and passengers were denied disembarkation. Ports were closed and cruise lines spent months trying to get passengers, and later crew members, home.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order for ships traveling from US ports.

The weight of responsibility of captaining a cruise ship had never been more apparent.

McCue's second stint on board Edge commenced in December 2019. The plan was she'd work three months on board, and then three months off.

The last voyage of McCue's December-March stretch was to coincide with International Women's Day, a special Celebrity sailing in which the ship was entirely staffed by female officers.

""That was a pinnacle moment in my career, to be able to be on a ship that was manned by what we called the 'Oceans 27',"" says McCue.

""But that is the cruise when everything kind of came to a head with Covid.""

McCue's reliever, supposed to arrive from Greece, never came.

""We all found out the flights from Europe were canceled,"" she recalls.

McCue's husband, who also works in the cruise industry, was on board Edge on vacation at the time.

As Covid worries heightened and uncertainty grew, he traveled back to Vegas, and McCue planned to follow.

""I said: 'Don't worry, I'll be home in two weeks, no problem.' Fast forward to seven months later, when I finally signed off earlier this month.""

McCue spent the spring, summer and first days of fall navigating the choppy waters of Covid-19's cruise restrictions and trying to do her best by her staff.

She stayed up to speed with cruise industry updates, but says she had to limit her general news consumption to stay sane in the face of so much uncertainty.

""From regulations and closures of countries around the world and situations that were popping up -- you couldn't have written a Hollywood script that could include all of the things that were coming at us,"" says McCue.

Complex CDC guidelines, a lack of commercial flights, widespread travel bans and closed borders complicated crew disembarkation.

Speaking to CNN at the height of the crisis, some crew members said they felt abandoned by the cruise lines, amid reports the situation was having an impact on staff's mental health.

McCue says the crew on Edge rallied around one another, and she celebrated every time a crew member successfully disembarked the ship and reunited with their loved ones.

""It was important for me to stay as long as I could to make sure that the 1,350 crew members that we had on Celebrity Edge -- and all of the crew members that we had in our fleet in the Caribbean -- that we could get off, did get off.""

One of several Celebrity Cruise Line vessels anchored in the Caribbean, Celebrity Edge became the 'mothership' -- the vessel designated to take disembarking crew members into Miami for sign off. The ship also took provisions and mail from Florida to the other ships.

When McCue disembarked in October, only four crew members remained on board Edge -- and she says they were all working again.

""I look back on that 10-month contract as the most satisfying contract of my career,"" says McCue.

""There weren't stripes, there weren't positions, it was -- in the end -- 80 people that just knew each other as family. And that was really cool.""

In fact, for McCue, disembarking and leaving the bubble of Celebrity Edge was bizarre, as excited as she was to see family again.

""I was petrified to get off,"" she says.

Postcards from the Edge

As Celebrity Edge spent months in limbo, McCue also documented life on board via her Instagram account.

She'd started the account when she first began working at Celebrity, encouraged by the PR team to show social media users a slice of seafaring life.

She's currently got 204,000 followers and counting.

""The way I always looked at the Instagram was yes, it's an inside look at the captain's life, but also, it's my digital photo album. And whether people love it or not, that wasn't really my concern. My concern was to be able to go back and look at my memories that I've made since I became a captain.""

From photos of cotton candy sunrises on the horizon, to videos of dolphins dancing in the waters below to clips of crew tie-dying shirts to pass the time, McCue's Instagram is a whirlwind look at life on board the ship.

This summer she started experimenting with TikTok, which she says is ""just for fun"" -- although she's already gone viral in a clip responding to a sexist comment -- and YouTube, where she answers more in-depth questions about life at sea.

""I look forward to the day where, honestly, being the first female anything isn't a thing anymore,"" says McCue. Courtesy Celebrity Cruises

There are also cameos from her cat, Bug Naked, who accompanies McCue on Edge and has an Instagram account of her own

Working as a cruise ship captain, no two days are the same -- even pre-Covid -- but McCue says one thing most days have in common is a wakeup call courtesy of Bug.

On sea days, it's important to McCue to be available and accessible for the guests as they enjoy life on board.

On port days, it takes about an hour and a half to two hours for the ship to dock. Once the ship's arrived, sometimes McCue will go out on the cruise excursions and explore the destination with the guests. If she stays on the ship, she'll do inspections and meet with crew.

McCue eschews the tradition of captain's dinners -- she decided prioritizing time with a small group of guests wasn't the best way to connect with passengers. Instead, she hangs out in busy areas of the ship and chats with guests as they enjoy their day.

In general, McCue says she's been able to put her own stamp on her job.

She recalls back when she worked at Royal Caribbean, and first became staff captain -- second in command on the ship. McCue had to take the mandatory psychological evaluation, which ensures staff are up for the job.

""At the end of it, I sat down with a gentleman to go through the results,"" recalls McCue. ""And he said: 'Everything was perfect. But I find that you tend to smile too much.'""

When McCue started at Celebrity, she found herself returning to this feedback, and trying her best to remain poker-faced.

""I was focusing so much on that, that I couldn't enjoy what I wanted since I was 12 years old, that had come to fruition. So, I said: 'Throw that out the window, I'm going to be me.'""

Nowadays, McCue enjoys injecting her personality and wide smile into her role -- and it's advice she gives others: you can take your job seriously, do the job well, and be yourself.

Offering these words of wisdom and acting as a role model for other young female seafarers is important to McCue, but she hopes one day it'll be redundant.

""I look forward to the day where, honestly, being the first female anything isn't a thing anymore.""

McCue says that, at first, having the spotlight on her both as a captain and as the first female captain was ""overwhelming.""

""I almost felt it was a bit unfair, because the men, when they were promoted, they got to do their job. And they got to do their job 100%. I felt like I had to do my job 100% but then I also had to do this representing of being a female.

""But then I realized, if I don't do it, who else is going to do it? If I don't do it, how will people see it?""

Right now, McCue is looking forward to the resumption of cruising and is confident the industry will bounce back from 2020.

Long term, her goal is to take a ship out of the yard in a new build.

Her ultimate dream? Becoming a ship's godmother."
158,,https://cnn.com/travel/article/travel-agents-covid-19-pandemic/index.html,Travel advisers: A secret weapon during Covid-19,"(CNN) — Before Covid-19, São Paulo resident Claudia Glina regularly planned trips around Brazil and all over the world for her family, which includes herself, her husband and their two young children.

""I used to go online and book the hotels and flights because that seemed like the easiest route to take,"" she says.

Then the pandemic happened.

After months of lockdown and no travel , the family was desperate for a getaway in August within driving distance of home but were unsure of where to go. Glina didn't know what properties had reopened, and even if they were accepting guests, she had multiple questions about their safety and health protocols.

""I considered myself a savvy traveler, but I couldn't get the information I was looking for online,"" says Glina. ""I was lost and overwhelmed trying to plan a simple vacation.""

Traveling during the pandemic is a personal choice and for those who are willing to take some risk. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""travel increases your chance of getting and spreading Covid-19. Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19.""

While Glina and her family were open to traveling, their health and safety was on top of mind. For reassurance and to find the best options, they turned -- for the first time -- to a travel agent.

'We felt safe'

The experience couldn't have been better, says Glina. Their adviser, Larissa Camhaji Ejzenbaum, the owner of Larissa Travel Designer , was recommended by a friend and presented them with a list of family-friendly resorts that she had personally visited within the past few weeks.

Glina chose the all-inclusive Tauá Resort Atibaia , located an hour from São Paulo, and the family spent five fun-filled days enjoying the property's water parks and multiple pools. Ejzenbaum even surprised them with a welcome gift of a framed family picture and scored them a room upgrade.

""The resort did a fantastic job of following social distancing, and we felt safe,"" says Glina. ""I wouldn't have felt comfortable going without Larissa's expertise, and now, I can't imagine traveling again without her help.""

Glina and are her family aren't the only ones relying on an adviser for the first time to plan their trips. Some international travel networks and agencies report a rise in clients who have never used travel agents before since the pandemic started.

In the wake of Covid-19, these would-be travelers, according to advisers as well as the people using them, are relying on agents to have the insider knowledge on hotels, border openings and quarantine rules.

Advisers also report that these new clients, in an uncertain travel environment, are looking to them to protect their payments on future trips if they need to be canceled or postponed and be their advocate when negotiating for refunds.

A rise in first-time clients

To be sure, advisers, like the rest of the travel industry, have taken a serious hit in the past several months.

According to the American Society of Travel Advisors, business has slowed dramatically since March with most agencies in the United States seeing a 75% decrease in income in 2020 compared with last year.

Further, the United States had more than 150,000 travel advisers before the pandemic. Since then, close to 60% of travel agencies have furloughed at least half their staff.

Yet, despite the dip in overall business, inquiries from first-time adviser users appear to be on the rise. The majority of these inquiries are referrals from existing clients, according to the heads of large travel networks as well as individual advisers.

As an example, Alex Sharpe, the president and CEO of Signature Travel Network, which has more than 8,000 advisers internationally, says that the network has seen a 20% increase in new customers since last year. Most have never booked their trips through an adviser, he says.

""Of course they're interested in a property's health and safety guidelines, but they also want to know how certain hotels and tour operators have responded to customers since the pandemic,"" he says. ""Did they give refunds or credits on canceled trips? Do they have generous cancellation and rebooking policies in place now?""

Navigating 'the new world of travel'

Travel Leaders Group, a network with more than 45,000 advisers globally, is also seeing a rise in new customers -- more so than it did pre-pandemic, according to President John Lovell.

""The top inquiry we get is from people who are saying that they have never used an adviser but think they need one now to help them navigate the new world of travel,"" he says.

Ejzenbaum, the Brazil-based adviser, says she has picked up 15 new customers since June, when travel started to reopen. ""Normally if I get six new clients in a year, it's a lot. Fifteen in a few months is huge,"" she says.

In Dublin, Ireland, Siobhan Byrne Learat, the owner of the travel company Adams & Butler , says that she is getting between five and 10 inquiries a day from new clients. Before Covid-19, it was around two or three.

""There have been a lot of horror stories in Ireland of travelers who have been gypped by travel suppliers when trying to get Covid-related refunds, and people are realizing that the ones using travel advisers have had better experiences,"" she says.

The new clients calling her are mostly asking questions about potential destinations to visit and holding reservations on trips down the line by giving refundable deposits.

""I'm not selling more travel, but I am establishing new relationships,"" says Learat.

Converted travel advisor loyalists

Like Glina of São Paulo, some of the travelers who have started to work with advisers recently say that they would book all their trips through them going forward.

Mary Grennan, who lives in Galway, Ireland, is working with Learat on a multiweek vacation to the United States for next summer.

""I tried to plan it on my own, but I want to visit so many different places and was having a hard time wading through all the possible destinations,"" she says.

A friend referred her to Learat, and although Grennan was initially skeptical and assumed that she would pay more by using an adviser, she was surprised to find out that the trip would be less expensive overall.

""Some of the hotel prices she found are lower than anything I found online,"" says Grennan.

Better still, the deposit she gave Learat is refundable until two weeks before the trip and can be converted into credit thereafter.

In another instance, Jackie Roby, a Boston resident, used an adviser for a trip to Riviera Maya and the Yucatan that she took with her husband in July.

Their agent, Eric Hrubant, the founder of CIRE Travel , booked their hotels, arranged excursions and transfers and even helped them preselect the seats on their flight that would give them the most distance from others."
159,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-second-lockdown-photos/index.html,Photos show a deserted Italy with new curfew regulations,"(CNN) — Hotels treating their few customers like royalty, empty art galleries where solo guests stand nose-to-nose with Renaissance art; and some of Europe's most famous open spaces with just a handful of people in them. The Italy of November 2020 is unlike anything that has gone before in the age of mass tourism.

When Agnes Crawford , a tour guide from Rome, visited the Vatican Museums on October 28, she found herself in the notoriously overcrowded Sistine Chapel with just 10 other people.

""It was emptier than when you do a special [semi-private] opening in the evening that costs thousands,"" she said.

""I don't think anyone who's from another country is really contemplating visiting at the moment.""

Ten days earlier, she'd taken a trip to Florence where, instead of lines to get in and crowds jostling in front of famous works of art, she found herself in the fabled Uffizi galleries face-to-face with works by the likes of Michelangelo, Botticelli and Raphael -- often alone.

Crawford stresses that the first week of November is always low season in Italy. But after an increase of tourists in the summer -- many of whom were drawn by the pictures of the country's famous art cities devoid of tourists -- the cities have emptied again.

With Covid-19 cases rising exponentially, on October 26, Italy issued a decree closing bars and restaurants at 6pm. And the annual slump in visitors has been joined by tourists swerving the country.

""I don't think there's a hotel in Florence with more than 10 rooms occupied,"" said Valeriano Antonioli, CEO of the Lungarno Collection hotel group in Florence.

The drop in visitor numbers led to an unprecedented 10-day period where, before their closure, Italy's cultural attractions were offering pretty much private visits for tourists and locals alike.

On November 6, the restrictions were tightened once again. There is now a nationwide curfew between 10pm and 5am, shopping centers are closed at weekends, public transport is capped at 50% capacity and -- unfortunately for the likes of Crawford -- museums and galleries have now closed, too, hopefully to reopen December 3.

The country has also been divided into red, orange and yellow ""zones"" according to their case numbers, with further restrictions for the highest risk red zones -- Lombardy, Piedmont, Calabria and Valle d'Aosta. In these regions, residents must not leave their houses except for work, health reasons, or to carry out essential shopping.

It means that some of Italy's most famous sites are almost deserted. And, unlike the spring lockdown, where residents were confined to their houses, for those outside the red zones -- which means most of the country -- this time they can enjoy their cities -- reclaim them, even -- by being outside.

Rome, open city

Crawford has been doing the rounds of Rome in recent days, posting pictures of a near-deserted Trevi Fountain and Roman Forum.

Her neighborhood, trendy Pigneto which is known for its pedestrianized nightlife stretch, ""felt like 4 a.m. at 6.30 p.m. on Friday night,"" she says. ""It was bizarre -- no chairs or tables outside, everything shut except the grocery store.""

VIP treatment in Florence

In Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance, ""every guest is seen as a jewel,"" says Valeriano Antonioli.

Hotel bars and restaurants are still allowed to serve guests after 6 p.m., but the crash in tourism means that many have closed until further notice, and others are working with just a few rooms (of the Lungarno Collection's four hotels and one apartment block, just one hotel -- the Portrait Firenze -- remains open).

November may be low season but it all depends on the weather, he says -- sunny days still see Florence busy. Or rather, they did until this year. After a summer that proved better than expectation, and a 45% occupancy rate in October, ""we were quite positive"", he says. ""We were very surprised to see that Europeans really traveled in October.

""Until 10 days ago we still hoped for a better future, but then all over Europe the number of positive cases increased dramatically. That, together with the new restrictions across Europe, practically emptied all our hotels.""

Yet, work aside, it has been a special time, he says.

The Ponte Vecchio (taken September 14) has been walkable in recent weeks Getty Images

""The center, which is normally populated by 100,000 tourists, is semi-empty. You can enjoy walking around more. And [until the new restrictions came into force] there were no queues to enter the exhibitions."" At a photography exhibition in October, he says, ""you could enjoy it without 100 people around every photo.""

""For people who can still travel, it's like being a VIP,"" he adds. ""There's a real attitude of thankfulness and everyone is treated like the king or queen.

""[Visitors] can have the same experience this year as they'd normally have to spend thousands to achieve.""

Of course, Florence's main attractions are its galleries -- so with them shut, the city looks set to become even emptier.

Film-set Venice

The Doge's Palace on what should be a busy Saturday afternoon, November 7 Julia Buckley

In Venice, the contrast has been even starker, since the majority of visitors stick to two outdoor areas -- the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square -- rather than enter museums.

Now, every evening, there's a steady trickle of locals in Piazza San Marco, walking around the empty square, and taking photos of the famous basilica and Doge's Palace.

The square's famous bars -- known for their live music and eye-watering prices as much as their beauty -- close at 6 p.m., but leave their chairs and tables in the square. So, each evening, a smattering of locals take to the empty chairs to chat or have an impromptu picnic of drinks or even pizza.

Giuseppe Calliandro, who owns the Antica Sacrestia restaurant a short walk from the square, says that the restrictions closing bars and restaurants at 6 p.m. changed everything.

""In the morning, Venice is still pretty alive -- there are few tourists but locals are moving around, and with schools, shops and bars open in the day, it almost feels normal,"" he says.

""But from the afternoon, the streets gradually start to empty, and in the evenings there are very few people walking around.""

Venice always feels like a film set in some ways, and never more so than now, with its empty set-piece squares and streets. What's more, the past few days have seen the city turned into an actual film set, with Tom Cruise in town to film a new Mission Impossible film.

""It's an important sign of Venice's huge attraction, even now -- and it's a glimmer of hope for the ""afterward.""

""But otherwise this feels like a city on hold again -- one that knows it has to wait even longer to redeem herself from an extremely negative year.""

And then there's Milan, which, as the capital of Lombardy, was hard hit by the first wave of the virus.

Along with Piedmont, Calabria and the Valle d'Aosta, in addition to the national restrictions, people must only leave their homes for essential reasons.

Shops, bars and restaurants have closed except for shops selling essential items, like grocery stores.

But right until the last minute, the Milanese were trying to continue as normal, said Carlo Dall'Asta, co-founder of the Farmily Group of bars.

""It was fairly full for breakfast -- we sold out of croissants,"" he told CNN Thursday, on their last morning.

""There have been slightly fewer people out and about, but everyone has just been waiting. Until yesterday [when the restrictions were confirmed] we didn't know what death we'd die.""

The square (shown May 30, 2019) is usually the hub for tourists visiting the city Getty Images

Milan's visitor numbers have plummeted this year to a quarter of 2019 figures. Although Dall'Asta says he noticed more European tourists than usual in the summer, many of the city's regular visitors are from the US and China -- both banned from the EU (the latter will be lifted if China lifts its reciprocal ban on EU travelers).

""From October I haven't seen any tourists,"" he said.

And he said that although things don't feel so different by day, it's ""very strange if you go for a walk after 6 p.m. -- much fewer people, everything closed. In the Navigli [the nightlife area where his bar, MAG Café , is located] you're used to walking around in the middle of the action -- there are people, lights, noise. Now, it's a different atmosphere.""

But despite everything, he's positive for the future.

""With six properties, we've always been attentive but I think we've improved our management. I think after the vaccine things will return as they were -- in fact, I think there will only be positive changes.

""Sadly, we're now closing because it's right to close. We're making the sacrifice, hoping this will last as soon as possible so we can come back and do our work better."""
160,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/lapland-save-christmas-covid/index.html,How Lapland plans to save Christmas from Covid,"(CNN) — Santa sitting safely behind plexiglass. Elves maintaining a safe social distance while wearing surgical masks.

It's a very 2020 take on festive cheer, but with a holiday season like no other fast approaching, Lapland's tourism operators believe it's the best way to save Christmas and save themselves after a brutal year which has seen visitor numbers plummet from record highs in 2019.

They've been helped by Finland's new quarantine rules , due to come into force November 23, which will, despite a Europe-wide second wave of coronavirus cases that is prompting new lockdowns, allow 72-hour visits in the country without the need to quarantine.

Tourists from EU and Europe's 26-country Schengen visa area will be permitted to arrive provided they take a Covid test 72 hours before departure and have proof that it's negative. Longer stays will require self-isolation and a second test. The rules are subject to change, however, with the Finnish government redrafting plans at the time of writing

""Christmas is definitely not canceled,"" says Sanna Kärkkäinen, CEO of Visit Rovaniemi, the official home of Santa Claus, high above the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland.

""This year will be different to previous years, but I'm sure that the travelers that do end up coming here will of course find huge enjoyment.""

Kärkkäinen says businesses in the region have been working flat out since summer getting ready for the holidays, ensuring they follow health and safety protocols to the letter.

""Together with the Lapland hospital district we've created a Covid-safe travel model. It's a large network of tourism providers and destinations here in Lapland and everyone has been involved.

""We are very committed to operating in that way and of course that is one of our signals to tourists that we are doing everything to make tourism safe and secure.""

Striking a balance

It's not what you think. To understand the heart of Rovaniemi, Finland, step away from the city center and into the quiet of the forest, where reindeer rule.

As well as Santa sitting behind plexiglass and his elves donning PPE, Kärkkäinen says that the lack of large groups and focus on individual groups means that visitors to Santa's workshop won't find any issues in ensuring social distancing.

""In a way the lower numbers helps us to develop the services to a level that we can really mix and match the health measures with all the services we provide,"" she says.

Domestic tourists have already been making their way north to see Santa, with Kärkkäinen reporting that the experience has been largely similar to previous years.

However, Kärkkäinen fears the strict quarantine-free time limit could mean some tourists opt to stay away.

""Seventy-two hours is quite a short stay for Lapland,"" she says. ""Normally they're between three to four days. Our aim has always been to have people enjoy the area and the destination in full, which means that stays have tended to be longer, which of course means trips are more sustainable.""

Despite this, operators have been tweaking schedules, cramming in sled rides, husky experiences and the chance to see the Northern Lights before getting travelers back to the airport in time for a swift departure.

Alistair McLean, managing director of The Artisan Travel Company, which runs bespoke trips to the region, says he's been impressed with how Finland is adapting to the situation.

""The Finnish government in particular has been working extremely closely with tourism representatives from Lapland to strike the fine balance between controlling the spread and allowing their vital tourism industry to operate safely,"" he says.

The nature of the outdoor activities on offer in Lapland means that it's easier to keep a safe distance, while usually spending time only with those you've traveled to the country with, he adds.

""We cannot guarantee for certain that Father Christmas or his elves will not be wearing a mask,"" says McLean.

""We believe after the incredible way everyone has adapted to the new normal of 2020, having a truly memorable, magical holiday to end the year will be incredibly rewarding -- even with a couple of extra safety precautions.""

Simon Lynch, director of sales at Scott Dunn is similarly upbeat.

""The season ahead looks promising for Finnish and Swedish Lapland,"" he says.

""We're encouraged by the flurry of inquiries that we've had for both of these destinations, both from families who are seeking that ultimate bucket-list trip over the festive period to see Santa and the reindeer, as well as from couples who are looking to alternative winter destinations for a remote romantic getaway under the Northern Lights, where they may have previously opted for a ski-focused winter trip elsewhere in Europe.""

Across the border in Sweden, Schengen, EU and UK visitors are not subject to quarantine rules. And the isolated nature of the region means that it's possible to enjoy a relatively safe break there, even if Santa actually lives in Finland.

""We are a destination with large areas, a lot of small and private lodgings and mostly outdoor activities that are offered to small groups or private companies,"" says Anna Skogh, from the Swedish Lapland Visitors Board. ""That has been an advantage when adjusting to a more socially distanced experience for visitors' safety.

Despite this, Skogh is not optimistic about visitor numbers.

""It does not look good for this winter. Long-distance travelers cannot travel, and travel restrictions for the closer markets change week by week. Swedish Lapland is particularly affected because we are such an international destination, especially for the winter season.

""The indications we get are that people are very interested in traveling here, but with the prevailing circumstances it is a challenge to make it happen.""

She says that there has been an increase in inquiries about direct charter flights to the region, subverting the need to change planes in Stockholm. However, with flight operators struggling, this remains an unlikely proposition for all but the wealthiest of winter-lovers.

It's Santa on the line

Christmas is big business in Rovaniemi, Finland but Santa Claus isn't what first sparked tourism in this Arctic Circle city.

Some operators have decided that with a backdrop of ever-shifting travel restrictions, a switch to a virtual approach is the way to go. After a year of video calls for work and catching up with family, it seems obvious that Santa should be available on screen rather than in person.

UK-based festive break specialist Santa's Lapland is offering ""Santa, Live from Lapland"" video calls for £85 ($111) for a family with up to four children. The calls last 10 minutes and are hosted by an elf who takes the family on a tour of Santa's cabin before meeting the big man himself.

The company suspended its 2020 trips in the wake of increasingly stringent travel measures from the UK to mainland Europe.

""With restrictions increasing throughout the UK, many of us have been wondering how we will keep the magic of Christmas 2020 alive,"" says Santa's Lapland CEO Paul Carter. ""We intend to help make it one to remember, by offering families the chance to meet Santa from the comfort and safety of their own home.

""While no Christmas can compare to the sheer excitement of traveling to Lapland to visit Santa in his snowy cabin, where the reindeer are real, and the Northern Lights dance across the night sky. Families will now still be able to enjoy a taste of the real Lapland magic this Christmas.""

Looking to 2021 and beyond

Many visitors have delayed their trip to Lapland until 2021. JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP via Getty Images

Santa's Lapland has already started offering bookings for 2021 and says that many of its customers who lost out this year have simply rebooked for next Christmas.

Julie Kenyon from Lapland Experiences says this has become popular with those keen to have something to look forward to in 12 months' time.

""Some of our tour operator partners have completely suspended their 2020 Santa program and moved most of their clients to 2021. Therefore, for people wanting to visit Lapland in December 2021, it is important to get booked up now as demand will be very high next year. I am moving clients to 2021 already and places are limited for this type of trip.

""If 2020 trips are not possible, the focus will shift to 2021 and I will be ensuring that all our 2020 clients are re-booked, and I'll advise anyone interested to get their Lapland holiday booked as soon as possible for next year.""

In Rovaniemi, where even the city street plan is shaped like a reindeer, Sanna Kärkkäinen is also looking to 2021 for a boost.

""We are definitely looking positively into the next season and the next winter season, '21/22. I think that will be the biggest aim now. Once the world is recovering, I think our development with tourism will be good again.""

For now though, saving Christmas depends on Finland keeping its new travel restrictions in place and intrepid Santa fans to look past the plexiglass and stump up for a pre-flight Covid test."
161,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/cossack-ghost-town-australia/index.html,Resurrecting Cossack: Seaside Australian ghost town poised for major transformation,"(CNN) — With its eerie empty streets, dark history, colonial architecture and stunning seaside location, remote Cossack is an offbeat but rewarding tourist attraction.

And now, this entire Western Australia ghost town could soon be on the market.

Located 1,300 kilometers north of Perth, Cossack was abandoned 70 years ago. Yet it remains lined by well-maintained, historic buildings.

The birthplace of Australia's pearling industry, it was dissolved in 1910 when a new port was opened to its north, then vacated in 1950.

Today it's inhabited only by a caretaker tasked with keeping the town neat and tidy -- and waving to the occasional tourist.

Soon, however, Cossack could be brought out of hibernation, as plans are reportedly underway to develop it into a bigger tourist attraction complete with eco-tourism accommodation, cafes, galleries and camping facilities.

Despite its remote perch in the northwest of Western Australia (WA), Cossack is in a prime location within the Pilbara region's tourism triangle of Coral Bay, Karratha and Karijini National Park.

Developing Cossack has been debated for decades, but it wasn't until late October 2020 that progress was finally made.

The WA Government, which owns Cossack, released a document asking investors to register interest in acquiring a leasehold or freehold title of the town, the latter of which refers to land ownership.

Any investor planning to develop Cossack would have to adhere to heritage and Indigenous land use agreements.

A bleak period in Australian history

Cossack has deep ties to Australia's Indigenous people, who've inhabited this region for more than 40,000 years and were subject to atrocities in the fledgling days of WA's pearling industry in the mid-to-late 1800s.

""Next time you gaze in wonder at the beauty of a Western Australian pearl, spare a thought for the Aboriginal people who suffered so appallingly during the industry's darkest days,"" reads a plaque at Cossack.

This refers to the slavery of Indigenous men, women and children, who were forced to dive for pearls. They did so to earn riches for Westerners who began pearling in Australia 20,000 years after its Indigenous people first harvested and traded these gems.

While this is a grim period of WA's history, that plaque is part of the inspiring Warlu Way , a 2,480-kilometer trail through the state's north, which introduces tourists to key Indigenous sites, beliefs and culture.

Cossack would be the perfect site for a new Indigenous tourism business focused on pearling history, according to Natasha Mahar, CEO of WA's North West Tourism Board.

She says the town enjoyed great success with its annual Cossack Art Awards, which for the past 28 years have exhibited artworks from across the Pilbara region, including many incredible Indigenous works.

""Outside that three weeks of the awards festival, Cossack is pretty much abandoned so it'd be great to see the town developed in a sustainable way so it can be vibrant all year round,"" Mahar tells CNN Travel.

""Telling the story of Cossacks' pearling from an Aboriginal perspective would be a great tourism initiative here.""

The town's unusual, ghost town environment offers a unique experience as well.

""When you walk around this empty place and see all its beautiful old buildings you feel drawn to understand its history, why it was abandoned,"" she says.

Cossack is one of more than a dozen ghost towns across WA, a massive state nearly four times larger than Texas.

With about 80% of the state's 2.7 million residents living in state capital Perth, that leaves an extraordinary amount of empty space. Hiding in some of these isolated nooks are formerly thriving towns, vacated when the industries that powered them ran dry.

The most notorious of these ghost towns lies 200 kilometers southeast of Cossack. Often called the deadliest place in Australia, Wittenoom was condemned by the WA government in 2008 for being riddled with lethal asbestos.

Mined for decades in Wittenoom, the mineral reportedly led to the cancer-related deaths of more than 2,000 residents of this town.

Although the WA Government urges travelers to avoid Wittenoom, due to the danger of airborne asbestos fibers, it has become a dark tourism hotspot . But aside from the notoriety it gained as a hazardous ghost town, Wittenoom has little to offer tourists.

Cossack, by comparison, has generous appeal. Unlike some of WA's other ghost towns, it hasn't been left to decay. Cossack has heritage protection status, meaning its stately 19th-century bluestone buildings have been impressively maintained.

Visitors to Cossack, who typically stay in the nearby town of Karratha, can follow a marked walking trail , which passes its most notable structures. These include the original post office, registrar's office, customs house, police barracks and lockup, Galbraith Store and the Courthouse, which now operates as a free museum.

Panoramic views of the town and coastline can be enjoyed from Cossack's Tien Tsin Lookout, which is adjacent to a 110-year-old leprosy quarantine center.

A similarly fine viewpoint, Reader Head Lookout, is just north of the town, and allows visitors to absorb the majesty of Cossack's beaches. A long, pristine and all-but-deserted strip of sand, Settlers Beach is wonderfully serene.

In addition to swimming and sunbathing, the coast near Cossack is renowned for its suitability for watersports like fishing, kayaking and snorkeling.

Mahar says this tranquil environment makes Cossack an appealing location for an eco-resort, adding she hopes any development of the town would blend into its unspoiled setting.

A WA State Government spokesperson confirmed to CNN Travel that investors could register interest in gaining a freehold title for Cossack, which equates to ownership.

But they stressed the WA Government was only seeking interest from investors at this stage, and that Cossack was not yet available to be leased or purchased. The deadline to register is November 20, 2020.

""The objective of the ROI (Registration of Interest) is to activate and revitalize the town site, as opposed to achieving a monetary value,"" the spokesperson says. ""Should a successful proponent be found, arrangements will be put in place to provide for the long-term management of the asset, subject to all relevant approvals, including Native Title and heritage conservation considerations."""
162,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/top-christmas-markets/index.html,The Christmas markets still going ahead in 2020,"(CNN) — There's nothing quite like a festive market to bring out the Christmas spirit in people.

While these events can be traced back to Vienna -- the city's first recorded December market was in 1298 -- the tradition has spread across the world over the centuries.

From Germany, to Switzerland, to New York, it's difficult to find a coveted destination that doesn't hold an impressive annual advent market.

In fact, some have grown so popular, they've become tourist attractions in their own right.

Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some well-known festive markets will not be taking place this year.

Here's our rundown of the 2020 Christmas markets that will be going ahead, as well as those that have been called off.

All information is correct as of November 9, 2020, but please do check before traveling.

Viennese Dream Christmas Market, Austria

With reindeer rides, a giant ferris wheel and a classic nativity scene to marvel at, Vienna's magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically.

Although there are around 20 Christmas markets in the Austrian capital to choose from, the Viennese Christmas Dream, held in front of City Hall, or Rathausplatz, is one of its oldest and most traditional events.

At the event, also known as Wiener Christkindlmarkt, you'll find over 150 stalls offering up tasty treats like Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.

The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a hot favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

Viennese Dream Christmas Market will be taking place with a number of additional safety measures, such as mandatory face coverings for both visitors and employees (except while consuming food and drinks).

It was due to begin in mid-November, but the opening date is now unconfirmed due to a multi-week lockdown issued by the Austrian federal government that came into effect on November 2.

Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland

It's hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland.

Most Swiss towns are pretty much taken over by festive markets at this time of year and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around.

Separated into two different sections at Barfusserplatz and Munsterplatz, it's made up of nearly 200 fabulously decorated stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles.

Families will particularly enjoy the Christmas fairytale forest at Munsterplatz thanks to activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star workshop and a festive train.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

At the time of writing, Basel Christmas Market was still due to take place from November 26 to December 23, 2020.

Strasbourg Christmas Market, France

One of Europe's oldest Christmas markets, Strasbourg began back in 1570, but it's evolved considerably since then.

Spread over more than 10 locations, including a section of the UNESCO world heritage site of Grande Île, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling Christmas lights and festive ornaments.

Each year an estimated two million people attend the market, which features around 300 wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine.

Place Klebe is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree on display, as well as the ice skating rink erected underneath.

But visitors will find plenty of magical sights while wandering through the city's narrow alleyways and pretty squares.

Is it going ahead this year? No. While officials were keen for the event to take place this year, last month mayor Jeanne Barseghian confirmed that the famous market has been canceled due to the rise in Covid-19 case numbers in France.

Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market.

The annual extravaganza, which extends across the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons, is one of Belgium's biggest and most popular events.

A light and sound show, ice skating, and fairground rides are among the activities to enjoy, while visitors can also browse through 200 or so chalets serving glühwein, Belgian beers and waffles and stare in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree erected in Grand Place.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic

Prague has several festive markets, but the main events are those in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Shutterstock

To say Prague goes all out at Christmas is something of an understatement.

The Czech Republic capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period.

While there's no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones are found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square.

Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes' walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.

Old Town Square provides endless entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops, while Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and locals treats like klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

Both markets have been canceled as a result of Covid-19.

""The Easter and now the Christmas markets have been canceled ,"" said Libor Votruba, Chairman of Taiko, who organize both markets.

""We are very sorry and it also affects our company. However, we respect the decision and offer the tree installation to the City of Prague for overhead costs.""

Fira de Santa Llúcia, Barcelona

Dating back to 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the feast day of Santa Llucia, which falls on December 13, to a three-week fair.

Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four different sections.

The first is nativity and figurines, where visitors can pick up nativity scene type decorations and figurines. Greenery and plants is packed with both natural and artificial trees and various types of plants.

The crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while simbombes is designated for musical instruments.

There are also many festive activities like storytelling, a Christmas parade, and the caga tio, an enormous pinata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

Fira de Santa Llucia will be taking place from November 29 to December 23 2020.

There's much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce's Franciscan Basilica.

Although this traditional fair is transported from Heidelberg, Germany to Florence every year, it's a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many Italian treats, such as panforte, for sale.

However, there's certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies.

Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that's lit up on December 8 for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

Organizers told CNN Travel that they are ""working to be able to open"" from November 27 to December 23, 2020.

Advent in Zagreb, Croatia

It's easy to see why Zagreb was voted the ""best Christmas market destination"" in travel portal European Best Destinations' online poll for three consecutive years.

The Croatian capital really goes to town during advent. Think live nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves.

Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to ""fooling around"" (or ""fuliranje"") where you'll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment.

Is it going ahead this year? Unfortunately this is still unclear.

While Advent in Zagreb 2020 hasn't been canceled as yet, and is currently scheduled to run from November 30 to January 7, officials have indicated that it may not go ahead.

""Conditions and possibilities of holding certain events have changed significantly this year, even for those outdoors in the autumn and wintertime,"" Martina Bienenfeld, director of the Zagreb Tourist Board said in a statement last month.

""We are working on measures and organization, and if it [the market takes place, we will respect and insist on all the guidelines that will be recommended.""

Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark

Rumored to be the inspiration behind Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year.

But you'll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period.

With over 500,000 fairy lights adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it's a winter experience like no other.

The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia's Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year's Eve.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

Christmas in Tivoli is still scheduled to take place from November 13 to January 3, 2020. The amusement park now has a number of new safety measures in place due to government guideline.

Face masks are now mandatory on some rides and all restaurants and cafés, while guests are not permitted to ""sing or dance to the music"" during live events.

Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia

The Estonian capital's annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets.

Set inside Tallinn's Town Hall Square, it's packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale.

On the entertainment front, there's a huge carousel, a winter grotto, an open-air ice rink and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeers.

Visitors are also treated to regular performances by dance troupes and choirs.

But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn's tree has been displayed here since 1441.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

Stockholm isn't exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen.

Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world's oldest open-air museum, it's a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic.

The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner.

Visitors can make their own decorations at Christmas workshops, take part in regular craft demonstrations or join in with the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen's main site.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

Skansen's Christmas Market has been canceled this year due to Covid-19. A guided Christmas walk will be held instead.

Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki

This wonderfully Scandinavian Christmas market is held in Helsinki's Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue.

Tuomaan Markkinat's center piece is a vintage carousel, but the nearly 150 vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies, glogi, Finland's non-alcoholic take on mulled wine, and handicrafts are also a big draw.

Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities like Christmas cookie decorating.

The market's food court is particularly impressive, with big names such as award-winning plant-based restaurant Grön listed among the eateries.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

Tuomaan Markkinat is set to run from December 5 to 22 this year.

Budapest has two main festive markets -- St. Stephen's Basilica Christmas market and Vorosmarty Square Christmas market.

The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade.

In addition, there are over 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts.

Meanwhile, Vorosmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts over 800,000 visitors annually.

Aside from the fantastic Hungarian foods that line its stalls -- langos and chimney cake are particular standouts, its main highlight is probably a giant advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

In October, organizers announced that the event had been called due to Covid-19. The Budapest Festival and Tourism Center (BFTK), has since launched a campaign to support the 120 or so Hungarian craftspeople who were due to sell their products at the annual fair.

Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets.

Capital city Berlin has around 80 to choose from, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned.

Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it's a maze of wooden huts with Bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with unique Christmas gifts.

At night, visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances.

Over in Nuremberg, Bavaria's second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century.

During the Christmas period, around 180 stands are erected in the city's central market square and the whole area is abuzz with activity.

The market draws in around two million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg's annual highlights.

Are they going ahead this year? No.

Sadly both events have been canceled this year. Helmut Russ, organizer for Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt, described the historic market as ""a cultural institution,"" while expressing his disappointment that it will not be held in 2020.

""It's incredibly painful to have to do this, because the Christmas market is also a cultural institution,"" he said in a statement. ""During dark times, it brings a bit of warmth and light into the city and into people's hearts.""

Meanwhile Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König released a statement announcing Christkindlesmarkt's cancellation last month.

""This decision is very difficult for us,"" it read. ""After much deliberation, and in order to protect the population, we have come to the conclusion that the Christmas market will not take place this year.""

Held in the historic Distillery District, Toronto Christmas Market serves as a rather charming take on the traditional European festive market.

One of the largest festive markets in North America, it features a Santa's Grotto, a gigantic light tunnel, fairground rides, a 50-foot Christmas tree, as well as beer gardens.

Visitors will be able to find everything from artisanal food, one-off gifts and festive cocktails at the numerous stalls here.

There are also regular musical performances from brass bands as well as Christmas carolers.

Is it going ahead this year? No.

Toronto Christmas Market 2020 has been called off by officials, who state that the crowds it attracts ""are just too large for safe physical distancing."" However, the Distillery District will be open for holiday shopping.

Winter Village at Bryant Park, New York

Each and every year, Manhattan's Bryant Park is transformed into a magnificent wonderland for the Winter Village.

The renowned open-air market is a wonderful sight to behold, with over 100 custom-designed kiosks and a 17,000-square-foot outdoor rink that's free to use provided you have your own skates.

Its food hall The Lodge provides an eclectic mix of eateries, along with an outdoor beer garden and a cocktail bar.

Outside the Winter Village, the Josephine Shaw Lowell Fountain is at its most beautiful during winter time, when it regularly freezes over.

Is it going ahead this year? Yes.

The Winter Village is scheduled to run from October 30, 2020 to March 7, 2021, but the event has been scaled down considerably, with fewer vendors and wider walkways.

The elaborate tree lighting ceremony has also been called off and visitors will need to book ice skating sessions and rentals in advance."
163,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-potato-dishes/index.html,The world's best potato dishes,"(CNN) — ""I used to take potatoes for granted,"" reads the first line of the book, ""Potato: A History of the Propitious Esculent.""

Author John Reader corrects this mistake by delving into the potato's rich history, one that dates back to the pre-Inca people of the Andes who first domesticated the potato around 8,000 years ago. Reader tracks the potato's migration to Europe at the end of the 16th century, its rise as the prized crop of Ireland and its eventual spread around the globe in new and delicious forms.

Despite attempts by anti-carb killjoys -- demonizing the addictive appeal of a plate piled with crispy, salty fries -- the potato endures as one of history's most beloved foods

Fried, baked, mashed and beyond -- whether the recipe calls for Russets or Yukon Gold, red-skinned or purple potatoes -- these are some of the most popular ways to enjoy a potato around the world.

Mashed potato

Late Michelin-starred chef Joël Robuchon claimed that he owed everything to his take on mashed potatoes. (Or, in his native French, ""pommes purée."")

Comfort food par excellence and holiday spread staple, the mashed potato is said to have emerged in the UK in the mid-18th century. Mash methodology may vary but a plate of mash today looks very much like the original: boiled potatoes mashed with butter, milk or cream with a dash of salt.

Some mashed favorites beyond the original include:

Champ / Colcannon, Ireland

Almost as soon as mashed potato appeared, it was mixed with kale or cabbage by Irish households to create a filling dish that would prepare workers for a long day of labor. Colcannon is also a traditional Halloween dish, with, in times past, a coin, rag, stick or other trinket stirred inside. Whichever item showed up on your plate was said to predict your future.

Stoemp, Belgium

A hearty, wintry dish that mixes puréed potatoes with seasonal vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, leeks, kale and turnip greens. Stoemp is both pub fare and a useful way to repurpose leftovers at home.

Bangers and mash, UK

""Bangers"" is a British slang term for sausages, dating back to World War II. Shutterstock

While the mash portion of this dish is fairly straightforward, it's the combination that makes it an enduring comfort food go-to. The bangers (sausages) elevate the mash and the creamy potatoes take the bangers beyond the ordinary. Smother both in gravy for peak pub-grub, belly-filling heartiness.

Meat pie with mashed potatoes and mushy peas, Australia

Yes, meat pies originated in Britain, but the Aussies took to the savory dish and ran with it, elevating it to the nation's unofficial official dish. Today, Aussies eat an estimated 270 million meat pies every year. Widely available, in everything from frozen ""party pie"" miniature form to the more modern gourmet varieties, the most revered version is a meat pie topped with mashed potato and mushy peas -- a bestseller at Sydney's famous pie cart, Harry's Café de Wheels

Duchess potatoes, France

If Duchess Potatoes (or ""Pommes Duchesse"") are a cousin of mashed potatoes, they are the posh, high-maintenance kind. To make this French favorite, mashed potato is puréed with egg yolk, butter and nutmeg and the mixture is piped into decorative swirls, which are then painted with more butter and browned in the oven until golden.

Duchess potatoes combined with choux pastry dough is the basis of another French potato dish, the churro-like pommes de terre Lorette.

Shepherd's pie, UK

Another dish that takes mashed potato and bakes it until crispy on top is this hearty dish with its roots in the UK. Ground meat is mixed with gravy, onions, carrots, herbs and other vegetables of choice, then topped with lashings of mash.

Traditionally, Shepherd's Pie uses lamb while Cottage Pie is made of beef, but you'll often find both varieties getting the Shepherd's label.

Potato bread, Ireland

You may have sampled it on St. Patrick's Day, but potato bread is a year-round treat in Ireland. Leftover mashed potato is turned into a dough to create triangles -- known as farls -- which are then cooked on a griddle or in a heavy frying pan. The resulting potato bread is often enjoyed with fried eggs on top for breakfast.

Irish chef Kevin Dundon recommends using mash that's still warm (or reheated) when trying your hand at potato bread at home.

A Chilean version of potato bread is known as milcao.

Crocchè, Italy

Can't decide between creamy mashed potato and a fried, crispy potato fritter? There's a snack for that, and we have the Italians to thank. Crocchè come from Sicily, but are also easy to find in Naples and elsewhere in the country.

In Palermo, they are known as ""cazzilli"" and back in the day they were a way to use up the oldest potatoes.

Today, they're a fun street-fair snack best enjoyed hot.

In India, a similar snack known as bonda also takes mashed potato (and spices), batters it and deep fries it until golden.

Chopped and fried

The french fry may be the world's favorite way to eat a potato. The concept is simple: Cut potato into straws and deep fry. But getting creative with variations on the original is half the fun.

As for that name, it's unclear that the fry originated in France. Some claim they began in Belgium, where the salty delight was first encountered by American soldiers during World War I.

How thick you cut your fries -- or chips, as they're known in the UK, Australia and other places -- is a personal preference that affects the level of crunch and texture of the end result. Shoestring fries tend to be used for dishes like steak-frites, while chunkier chips, splashed with with malt vinegar or ketchup, are favored for fish and chips.

There's no dish more British than fish and chips. Suzanne Plunkett/CNN

In Belgium, frites with mayo -- or myriad other sauces -- are a point of national pride, and in the UK and Ireland, curry or gravy chips make a useful late-night repast after several of your ales of choice. Aussies go mad for chicken salt on their hot chips, and in Texas, chili cheese fries give the dish the nachos treatment, loading up the fries with chili, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese, jalapeño peppers and other accoutrements.

Poutine, Canada

Apparently, waiters at one of the first restaurants to serve Quebec's now iconic dish grew tired of writing ""fries, cheese curds and gravy,"" giving birth to the moniker ""poutine,"" meaning pudding or a ""mess.""

More than one establishment lays claim to creating it. But no man has eaten more of it in one sitting than competitive eater Joey Chestnut, who, in 2019, ate a record 28 pounds of the stuff in 10 minutes at the Smoke's Poutinerie World Poutine Eating Championship in Toronto. In the Northeast United States, you'll find a spin on poutine known as disco fries -- topped with gravy and melted cheese -- in classic American diners.

Potato wedges/Jojo, United States/Australia

A popular bar snack in Australia (and well beyond) -- where they are often served with sweet chili sauce on the side -- potato wedges are as advertised. A wedge of potato baked or, more commonly, fried, and usually seasoned with spices including paprika.

In the Northwestern United States, the Jojo is often mistaken for a potato wedge -- but in fact, this local specialty is potato battered with a spiced breading similar to that on fried chicken.

Fried potato dishes

There's more to the fried potato universe than fries alone. While these fried dishes might involve buckets of hot oil and calories, they make up for it in ""just one more bite"" addictive flavor.

Potato hash, United States

Often made with leftovers from holiday meals, potato hash is a breakfast dish that's just as tempting any other time of day. Whether reheating potatoes or baking a fresh batch, they should be diced before throwing into a skillet with your chosen accompaniments. Ree Drummond, the food blogger behind ""The Pioneer Woman,"" favors bell peppers, squash, zucchini and onions. Once it's all cooked through and the potatoes are golden, serve with a fried egg on top.

Bubble and squeak, UK

On the other side of the pond, the concept of repurposing last night's dinner takes the form of bubble and squeak, which involves frying up leftover cabbage and other vegetables with the remaining mashed potatoes from a Sunday roast. The result resembles a quiche, which is often cut into wedges and served as a side dish. Or it can be the main attraction for a quick and easy lunch or dinner -- and, like a hash, enjoyed with a fried egg on top.

Hash browns, United States

According to Dr. Potato (yep), processed hash browns first appeared in the States in the mid 1950s but author Barry Popkik traces the term back to 1911. Like home fries, hash browns were often served in hotels and railroad dining cars before becoming a popular lunch counter and diner staple.

The dish -- diced or shredded potatoes fried into potato cake -- is now an integral part of the McDonald's breakfast menu, even if it plays more of a supporting role to the Egg McMuffin.

Tater tots, United States

A nostalgic TV dinner side, the tater tot is a true American success story. As Eater chronicles , the bite-sized pieces of fried potato made their debut at the glamorous Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach -- introduced at the 1954 National Potato Convention by Oregon frozen potato entrepreneur F. Nephi Grigg.

After dominating the frozen-food aisle it was only natural that contemporary chefs would start to play with tots and give them a gourmet spin

Minnesota hot dish, a casserole of ground meat, vegetables (optional) and cheese or another creamy sauce. In Utah, funeral potatoes use shredded hash brown potatoes in a similar hot dish that gets its name from its ubiquity at post-funeral gatherings. Midwesterners (including, famously , one-time presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar) also use tater tots to layer atop, a casserole of ground meat, vegetables (optional) and cheese or another creamy sauce. In Utah,use shredded hash brown potatoes in a similar hot dish that gets its name from its ubiquity at post-funeral gatherings.

Patatas bravas, Spain

If you can't get to Spain to sample the world's best patatas bravas, bookmark the Instagram account @bravasbarcelona to whet your appetite. Self-professed ""patatas bravas hunter"" Edu González claims that the dish was first served in Madrid or Toledo in the 1950s, but the more popular story is that the tapas hit originated at Barcelona's Bar Tomás. What is undisputed is that these fried cubed potatoes, smothered in a spicy tomato-based sauce are delicioso and adictivo.

Potato scallops, Australia

Potato scallop, potato fritter or potato cake? Potato Potahto. Like their mates, the fish and chips, this fried delight actually originated in England. Doesn't matter; Aussies love them, often consuming scallops -- a thin slice of potato dipped in batter and deep-fried -- on hot summer days at the beach. In Sydney, the words ""scallop"" and ""potato scallop"" are interchangeable, and the kind you find in the ocean have been relegated to ""sea scallops.""

Potatoes sarladaise, France

This dish comes to us from the town of Sarlat in Périgord, the home of duck (or goose) confit and it's as simple as it is decadent. To make, slice potatoes and fry them in confit fat. Truffles, another local delicacy, are added for one more sucker punch of OTT flavor.

Kuku sibzamini, Iran

These Persian potato fritters are elevated by adding turmeric powder and saffron to the egg mixture that's combined with rough-mashed potatoes to form the patties. They're fried and served hot, with yogurt on the side.

Potato chips/crisps, UK/Ireland

Can't you almost taste the salt on your tongue? Shutterstock

They're the hero of parties and the playground, and are one of the world's most beloved snack foods. But where did the potato chip come from? Apparently the origin story tracing it to New York's Saratoga Springs in 1853 is a myth, while the earliest known recipe is traced to Englishman William Kitchiner's 1817 book ""The Cook's Oracle.""

Potato chips remained unseasoned until the 1950s, when Joe ""Spud"" Murphy, owner of Ireland's Tayto crisp company, developed a technology to add flavoring during manufacturing. The result was the still iconic Tayto cheese and onion, and companies around the world soon rushed to follow suit.

Potato pancake dishes

Latkes, Eastern Europe

This fried potato pancake, traditionally served with sour cream and applesauce, is best known for its starring role in the traditions of Hanukkah. As Bruce Weinstein explains in ""The Ultimate Potato Book,"" ""folklore claims that the oil in the skillet reminds us of the oil lamps that miraculously burned for eight days.""

Latkes sometimes get a bad rap for being bland, but chef Andrew Zimmern has a recipe for ""Killer Potato Latkes"" that he likes to serve with applesauce, crème fraîche, smoked salmon, salmon roe and dill.

Rösti, Switzerland

It's the unofficial dish of Switzerland -- once eaten by farmers and now enjoyed by the masses. The word rösti means ""crisp and golden,"" just as the sauteed potato fritter is best savored. In ""The Ultimate Potato Book,"" Weinstein recommends using parboiled potatoes to ensure the perfect level of rösti crispiness.

Gamja jeon, Korea

A savory, highly customizable potato pancake traditionally eaten on rainy days in Korean homes. Gamja jeon pancakes are made with finely grated potato and onion and fried until golden.

Baked and roasted potato dishes

Whether you like 'em small or chunky, soft or crispy, roast potatoes are a beloved side dish -- a holiday must-have. In Italian, they're patate al forno; Greeks roast their potatoes with lemon.

Loaded or dressed baked potatoes, on the other hand, can serve as a main meal, piled high with cheese, bacon and other calorific delights. Most recipes call for baking a potato in foil until soft, scooping out the flesh and mixing it with butter, sour cream, chives and your chosen ingredients before refilling the potatoes and popping them back in the oven for a quick finish.

Pommes Anna, France

It's so famous that there's a baking dish named after it, the la cocotte à pommes Anna. Before the potatoes go into the copper pan, they're peeled and sliced thin, and then layered with plenty of clarified butter and baked in their namesake dish until they resemble a cake. The next step is to flip the cake over to cook the other side -- a process the la cocotte à pommes Anna helps to simplify.

Potato gratin, France

Creamy and crispy: gratin Dauphinois potatoes. Shutterstock

Another popular way to eat potatoes in France is in the form of a gratin, a kind of fancy, creamy casserole finished with a browned crust. It's made by layering sliced boiled potatoes with cream or béchamel sauce and a cheese like gruyère, and baking until hot and inviting.

Potato salad dishes

It's a crucial part of a summer spread; a true July 4 classic. Potato salad may be as American as apple pie, but it's said to have arrived in the US by way of European immigrants. Who, in turn, were introduced to the dish by Spanish explorers.

While there are endless iterations, the American potato salad most closely resembles German potato salad. The switch from dressing the cooked potatoes in oil, vinegar and herbs (as was the German style) to dousing them in creamy mayo seems to have occurred around the time that commercial mayonnaise became popular in the US -- in the 1920s and' 30s. German potato salad was usually served warm; the Americanized version is best eaten cold.

Japanese potato salad

Switch out the mayo for Japanese Kewpie mayo and opt for half-mashed potato rather than boiled and you'll be halfway to making a delicious Japanese potato salad. This spin calls for rice wine vinegar and chopped cucumber and carrots for crunch.

Russian salad

The origins of Russian, or Olivier salad, can be traced back to the 19th century and Russia's celebrated pre-Revolution restaurant The Hermitage. The modern version typically includes diced potatoes and other vegetables, creamy dressing and pickles.

Boiled potato dishes

The bane of many kids' existence, boiled potatoes usually require oodles of butter, herbs or other dressings to become covetable (see loaded or dressed potatoes). The following dishes take the humbled boiled potato to tastier heights via strategic pairings.

Papas chorreadas, Colombia

Boiled potatoes, meet onions, tomatoes and queso blanco. This cheesy dish gets its name from the word ""chorrear,"" meaning ""to pour,"" which is what you do with that delicious sauce -- enough to cover the potatoes and then some.

Salade niçoise, France

Boiled red-skinned potatoes (best when chilled overnight) add some heft to an otherwise light mixture of tomatoes, anchovies, olives, capers and green beans that can be traced back to, as the name suggests, Nice on the French Riviera.

Potato stew dishes

When tough cuts of meat are slow-cooked to bring out the flavor, it's more than likely that chunks of potato are swimming around in that pot, too.

Stovies, Scotland

Like so many stews, stovies evolved as a good way to resurrect the previous night's roast beef and lard. Sliced potatoes and onions were thrown in a pot to stew alongside the meat until tender and the resulting ""stovies"" were usually enjoyed with a cracker or oatcake and a glass of whisky.

Aloo gobi, India

A classic Indian stew, aloo gobi is made with potatoes, cauliflower and peas and served over rice or atop some naan bread. It can be customized, spice-wise and by adding a range of ingredients such as crab, mushroom or shrimp. Many other curry recipes also call for potatoes (""aloo"") including saag aloo (with spinach) and aloo gosht, popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Curried potatoes is also a common side dish in Uganda.

A few more delicious stews featuring potatoes include:

Caldo verde, a Portuguese broth made with grated potatoes, collard greens and chouriço sausage.

Irish stew, a hearty mix of lamb (or mutton), potatoes and other root vegetables.

Potato dumpling dishes

Knish, New York

Here's a potato dish so iconic that it gets top billing in the book, ""Knish: In Search of the Jewish Soul Food,"" by Laura Silver. Knishes are baked or fried pastries filled with seasoned potato and other goodies. Silver visits Poland and Israel to trace the knish's history and also explores its dominance in New York City -- particularly Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and the Lower East Side.

Blintzes, another Jewish snack, are rolled, thin pancakes that can also contain potato filling, but more often feature cheese or fruit inside.

Potato pierogi, Poland

Pierogi have been made in Poland since the 13th century and they proliferated across Eastern Europe. Small dumplings that are boiled and then fried, pierogi can be stuffed with almost anything, including sauerkraut, ground meat and fruit. Cooked potatoes, along with cheese and fried onion, are the filling for what's known as pierogi Ruskie.

Gnocchi, Italy

The main line on gnocchi is that it originated in northern Italy in the 16th or 17th century but Saveur's history of the mini potato dumpling pasta claims that it was enjoyed across the Italian peninsula, perhaps even earlier than that. Sauce pairings vary but gnocchi is almost always made of potatoes, flour and salt. The trick is to cook it quickly so it winds up on your plate light and tender.

Skordalia, Greece

Greeks love dips, whether served as a starter or as a sauce for protein, and skordalia brings the humble potato into the mix. The garlic-laced dip is thickened by blending mashed potatoes with olive oil and lemon juice. Crushed almonds or walnuts are sometimes sprinkled in as well.

Causa rellena, Peru

These little stacks of citrusy mashed potatoes are typically layered with chicken or seafood, avocado and limes to create a refreshing Peruvian appetizer. The dish is said to have originated in the 1879 War of the Pacific involving Chile, Bolivia and Peru.

Blitva, Croatia

A rustic dish from the Croatian coast, blitva is now commonly served across the country, often as a side with meat or grilled seafood. It combines garlicky chunks of boiled potatoes with wilted Swiss chard and olive oil.

The Dutch enjoy a similar dish of potato mashed with endives, called andijviestamppot.

164,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/california-wine-country-napa-sonoma-wildfires-tourism/index.html,Fire-ravaged California Wine Country: We're still here,"Healdsburg, California (CNN) — The subject of the call was dire: Scattered reports of fire. On the mountain. Maybe headed straight for the Meadowood Napa Valley resort.

It was late September, and most resort employees had evacuated to safer spots. Officials organized a conference call to reassure their people not to panic. Christopher Kostow, executive chef of The Restaurant at Meadowood , was one of those on the line.

The group discussed conflicting news reports of fire burning nearby vineyards . They shared first- and second-hand stories of friends losing everything. Finally, someone interrupted: What about ""the picture?""

The picture, of course, was one that is now burned in the brains of everyone within a 30-mile radius of the most vaunted wine region in California

In the foreground, a lone CalFire firefighter stands in an orange jumpsuit atop a heap of plant debris. In the background, the three-Michelin-star restaurant and top story of the luxurious Clubhouse at the five-star Meadowood resort are completely engulfed in flames.

Kostow hadn't seen the photo tweeted out by a Bay Area journalist until someone texted it to him moments later. The chef was driving when it came through on his phone. After glancing at it, he nearly veered off the road.

""I knew immediately -- you don't come back from that,"" Kostow said days later, still recovering from the shock. ""We put 12 years of human capital into that place, and it disappeared in a few hours.""

Kostow's restaurant wasn't the only casualty of wildfires in Wine Country this year. Two separate fires over the course of three months singed acres of vineyards, hundreds of homes and several other tourist destinations throughout the area.

The most recent blaze -- the Glass Fire -- wreaked havoc in Napa County, hitting Meadowood and obliterating the five-star Calistoga Ranch resort. It damaged or destroyed nearly twodozen wineries as well.

In August, the hulking LNU Complex Fire hit both sides of the region, burning all the land around Lake Berryessa in Napa County and threatening the Russian River Valley resort towns of Forestville and Guerneville on the Sonoma County side.

Cleanup and recovery operations are ongoing where possible; in some cases, those businesses that had shuttered because of damages have reopened.

Still, after an economic slowdown thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic and three horrific fire seasons out of the past four, many local folks can't help but wonder: Will travel to Wine Country ever be the same?

State of the region

To be clear, Napa and Sonoma counties are still vibrant, beautiful places.

Yes, there have been terrible fires since 2017. Yes, people have died. Yes, fresh black burn scars slash the otherwise verdant landscape. All told, across both counties the fires have destroyed more than 7,500 homes.

Amazingly, however, in the context of the local tourism infrastructure, these natural disasters really haven't precipitated the type of Armageddon that many might extrapolate from headlines and video they see on TV.

Take the most recent Glass Fire, which burned more than 67,000 acres overall.

Linsey Gallagher, president and CEO of Visit Napa Valley, the organization tasked with marketing the Napa Valley as a travel destination, said the region is home to about 475 wineries. She noted that only 31 -- roughly 6.5% -- were directly affected by the fire.

Of the 31, she said, 11 suffered major damage or destruction.

Among those reporting serious or total losses: Burgess, Cain, Dutch Henry, Hourglass, Newton and Sherwin Family. The 45-year-old Chateau Boswell also burned to the ground; all that remains today is the winery building's stone façade.

""Our thoughts go out to all who were impacted by this most recent fire,"" Gallagher said. ""We have endured phylloxera (a louse affecting vines), Prohibition and earthquakes, and we'll get through this, as well.""

Officials at wineries that endured less significant damages -- all of which are open for tastings again -- shared harrowing stories of perilously close calls.

Hugh Davies, president of the sparkling wine producer Schramsberg , reported that fire crews rushed up the hillside and saved all structures at his property outside Calistoga. He noted that a recent effort to create space between buildings and forest likely facilitated the heroic effort, and said that a few vines did burn.

At Castello di Amorosa, a Calistoga winery in a replica of a medieval stone castle, the fire burned a storeroom but not the main structure. Tom Davies, president and managing partner of sister winery V. Sattui (and no relation to Hugh), said the castle ""got lucky.""

Philippe and Cherie Melka, owners of Melka Estates & Winery in St. Helena, said flames incinerated their grown child's detached living quarters and a guest cottage, but firefighters miraculously saved the family's main home and the main winemaking facility.

""We recognize it could have been a lot worse,"" Cherie Melka said. ""We're thankful we're still here.""

Fallen icons

While the Glass Fire took out 150 of the 5,500 hotel rooms in Napa County, the losses represent two iconic properties: Calistoga Ranch and Meadowood Resort.

Calistoga Ranch, an ultra-luxury resort with 50 rooms, was destroyed -- its exquisite main building, spa and $800-per-night cabins reduced to ashes in a matter of hours as the fire advanced from St. Helena north.

Todd Cilano was regional vice president of the resort, and in an email noted that the ""Ranch"" was a celebration of Wine Country. He wrote that the property was home to a working cabernet vineyard, hiking trails and a flourishing garden and a chicken coop that produced hyperlocal ingredients for the on-site restaurant. He added that people loved the resort because of how it blurred the line between inside and out.

""Our intention is to reestablish the resort, but it will take some time to rebuild,"" wrote Cilano, who is also general manager at Solage, a neighboring property which, like Calistoga Ranch, is part of the Auberge Resorts Collection . ""The outpouring of support from past guests who already cannot wait to return has been incredibly encouraging.""

At Meadowood, many of the guest rooms survived the blaze but took on varying degrees of smoke damage. Since the clubhouse and other buildings were incinerated, the resort has closed to assess fallout and devise a rebuilding plan. No reopening date has been announced.

One thing is certain: The Restaurant at Meadowood will have to find a new home.

Kostow described his overriding emotion about the fire as ""grief,"" and likened losing the beloved restaurant to the death of a family member.

""To be honest I've never experienced anything like this in my life and I don't think I ever will again,"" he said. ""It makes you think about what was of value in what you had done and what should be of value going forward. It throws into question everything about our industry and the value of the work we do. When nothing is physically left, there you are, asking yourself the question, 'What of value remains?'""

Kostow continued: ""For me it was such an honor over the years to work with the people I worked with. We worked hard. We did something unique. I'm so proud of the work they and I were able to do together. Fire can't render that moot.""

Kostow has another local restaurant -- The Charter Oak -- in St. Helena, and said he expected to be able to keep most of his staff busy with work there.

He also said he is ""looking at ways to keep the team working together"" into 2021 and beyond.

Tackling other challenges

In Sonoma County, the hospitality industry has held its collective breath; while both the Glass Fire and an offshoot of the LNU Complex named the Walbridge Fire threatened thousands of local businesses, both fires burned mostly in wild areas and neither wreaked significant damage to the tourism infrastructure.

Of course, Sonoma County was hit harder in previous years, with the Kincade Fire threatening Healdsburg in 2019 and the Tubbs Fire blazing a path of destruction through Santa Rosa in 2017. Certain neighborhoods of Santa Rosa are still rising from the ashes.

This year, in addition to poor air quality, the biggest challenge for Sonoma County was one familiar to tourist destinations all over the world: the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Yes, we battled blazes and a pandemic, but this is a place that personifies resiliency, creativity and a passion for the best life has to offer,"" said Claudia Vecchio, president and CEO of Sonoma County Tourism. ""While the past several years have given us myriad challenges, Sonoma County continues to be a place where travelers can breathe in the stunning natural beauty, escape the crowds of the city and create (great) moments.""

The Arista Winery in the Russian River Valley sits on 36 acres and is ideal for social distancing. King Lawrence

As Vecchio suggested, many wineries, hotels and restaurants have improvised.

In the Russian River Valley, for instance, Arista Winery bolstered an existing lineup of private tastings with outdoor experiences held at six spots around the 36-acre ranch.

Mark McWilliams, co-owner and director of operations, said all of these tastings come with small bites, and noted that each of the spots is secluded by big and beautiful oak trees, which means that visitors by nature are practicing physical distancing when they visit.

""We're kind of set up with these private islands where I can have five groups here at any given time but they never see each other and feel like they're the only group on the property,"" said McWilliams, whose winery is in unincorporated Healdsburg. ""We did this because it's the best way to soak up the view and take in the beauty of this ranch. Turns out (these offerings) work for Covid, too.""

Because Sonoma County restaurants have not been allowed to offer indoor dining until Covid-19 case numbers fall below a certain threshold, restaurateurs have had to pivot in different ways.

In Windsor, Leah Scurto turned her dine-in pizza parlor, PizzaLeah , into a take-out only business. In the city of Sonoma, Sondra Bernstein this summer opened a satellite location of her girl & the fig restaurant in the plaza across the street.

Back in Healdsburg, restaurateur Dustin Valette spent more than $50,000 to create an al fresco patio on the street adjacent to his restaurant, Valette

Inside, the restaurant could seat 49. Outside, the restaurant now seats 37.

""The patio is a bridge -- we're not at break-even, but we are in a position to endure losses,"" said Valette, whose 79-year-old father still flies air tankers for CalFire. ""With fires and Covid, we're doing the best we can while still delivering on great food and a memorable experience.""

Hotels and local hotel companies embraced big changes, too. Four Sisters Inns, which operates seven boutique hotels in Wine Country, this summer signed up with Whistle, a text-messaging platform that allows concierges and other employees to communicate with guests from a safe distance.

The 25-room Farmhouse Inn & Spa in Forestville replaced communal s'mores bowls with single-family packets for guest to use to concoct goodies over the poolside fire pits. Also, every guest gets a face covering.

Some hotels even made operational changes -- Vintners Resort in Santa Rosa shortened its cancellation policy to 72 hours from seven days and no longer charges guests for canceling reservations.

""Between the fires, the smoke from the fires, and Covid, we realized guests wanted us to be more flexible,"" said General Manager Percy Brandon. ""We're doing whatever we can to make people feel welcome and attract more business.""

What comes next?

Across both counties, hoteliers, restaurateurs, winery owners and tour operators wonder whether all the pivoting they are doing will be enough.

Battling the pandemic slump was challenging on its own, but with the additional threat of fires, the pervasive challenge of poor air quality because of wildfire smoke and the forthcoming danger of flooding and landslides during winter rains, many locals are uneasy.

""It's multiple layers of crisis,"" said Gallagher, the head of Visit Napa Valley.

Currently, the busiest time of the year in Wine Country is harvest, which usually takes place from August to November -- the heart of fire season. Assuming the risk of Covid-19 will eventually go away, some locals wonder if encouraging visitors to come at different times of year might help circumvent complications associated with climate change.

One possibility: Bud Break, when grape vines wake up from winter dormancy and produce their first buds of the new season. This usually happens sometime between mid-February and mid-March, depending on weather and temperature.

Currently, at least from a tourism perspective, this timeframe is considered part of the region's ""off-season."" That means tasting rooms are less crowded and hotel rates are low -- perfect conditions to attract new guests.

Two other possibilities include summer, which can get beastly hot, and November through January, which -- at least before the past few years -- has been characterized mostly by rain.

""(Typically) winter is rainy, but it's a beautiful time to be here,"" said Joe Bartolomei, co-owner of the Farmhouse Inn. ""Maybe one of the ways we can survive the disruptions is by doing a better job of showing people we are a year-round destination.""

Other insiders think the answer is better education about local geography, climate and ecosystems.

Art Murray, president and owner of Flambeaux Wine in Sonoma County's Dry Creek Valley, said that when visitors come for tastings, he usually pulls out a topographic map and tries to show them where the region's valleys are in relation to each other. Murray also spends time distinguishing between Napa and Sonoma counties, which are separated by a mountain range and ecologically distinct.

To demonstrate the need for this basic education, Murray shared his own story. The Walbridge Fire came within less than a mile of his house and he barely heard from friends out of state. But when the Glass Fire was raging in Napa, 30 to 40 miles away, his phone wouldn't stop vibrating."
166,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italian-town-salemi-auctioning-one-euro-homes/index.html,The Italian town auctioning off abandoned homes for €1,"(CNN) — The Covid-19 pandemic may have irreversibly changed the world as we know it, but it seems there are some things that can still be counted on.

And struggling towns in Italy selling off abandoned homes at bargain prices in a bid to reverse a trend of depopulation is undoubtedly one of them.

The picturesque town of Salemi in Sicily is the latest to offer up dilapidated properties for less than the cost of an espresso.

Over the next month, a few dozen crumbling dwellings will go up for auction with a starting price of €1, or little over a dollar.

The town's mayor, Domenico Venuti, hopes the scheme will breathe new life into Salemi, which saw its population shrink considerably when at least 4,000 residents fled following the terrible earthquake of 1968 that rocked Sicily's Belice Valley.

""All buildings belong to the city council, which speeds up the sale and reduces red tape,"" Venuti tells CNN Travel

""Before launching the scheme we first had to recover the old parts of Salemi where the houses are located, upgrading infrastructures and services from roads to electric grids and sewage pipes.

""Now the town is ready for the next step.""

Revitalization hopes

Sicilian town Salemi is hoping to attract new residents by auctioning off homes with a one euro starting price. Francesco Russo

While it might seem like Salemi is rather late to the one-euro-home party, officials here were among the first to suggest selling off dilapidated homes for next to nothing on the condition that buyers renovate the properties.

Similar schemes have been launched in a number of Italian hamlets, such as Cinquefrondi , a community in the southern region of Calabria, and Mussomeli , also in Sicily.

However, officials couldn't get the Salemi project signed off at the time due to various bureaucratic issues, and it was deemed necessary for the town to receive an external makeover first.

""It was a long process,"" explains Venuti. ""Not only did we carry out thorough maintenance works to secure the risky crumbly areas, we also had to recover many properties to residential use.

""We've been ready for a while but wanted to wait and see how the Covid-19 emergency evolved.""

Italy was hit particularly hard by Covid-19 relatively early on, although Sicily has so far been one of the European nation's least impacted regions.

While Venuti admits the virus remains a concern for residents of the town, which currently has around 30 reported cases, he believes now is the right time to move forward with the scheme, stressing that case numbers are decreasing by the day.

The selected houses will go up for auction with a €1 starting price, replicating the method adopted by the Sicilian town of Sambuca, where dwellings were sold to the highest bidder and at least one buyer purchased a house sight unseen.

Urban impact

Some buildings were substantially damaged during the 1968 earthquake that rocked Sicily's Belice Valley. Francesco Russo

Dating back to the 1600s, the homes lie in the heart of the historical center, enclosed by the ancient town walls.

While some may be in need of substantial repairs due to the damage caused by the earthquake, many are in reasonably good shape, with minimal work required.

Covering an area of at least 85 square meters, they're made with a yellowish-pink solid sandstone extracted from nearby caves which is called ""campanedda,"" or ""bell' in local dialect -- its name comes from the sound the stone makes when hit with a hammer.

All have very similar features, such as multiple floors and thick walls, while a few have panoramic balconies, but those on Belvedere Street are arguably the most attractive, as they overlook a rich green valley.

Although restyled several times over the centuries, the homes, which stretch across two to three floors, were once microcosms of rural life in the town.

When they were first constructed, families would sleep on the upper floors, while their animals were kept in stables on the ground level.

According to Venuti, potential buyers aren't required to visit Salemi to inspect the homes before making an offer, but they will need to send a detailed restyle plan to demonstrate their commitment to the project.

Those interested can view photographs of available properties, along with maps identifying their whereabouts, and download application forms on the city council's institutional website once the project goes live.

The renovation projects will also be evaluated according to the urban impact.

Those planning to convert one of the properties into a B&B or another type of business establishment with economic activity will receive extra points and tax credits.

A single buyer can purchase more than one house, but all buyers must pay a deposit guarantee of €3,000, which is to be returned if the restyle is completed within three years.

Venuti says there are at least another 100 dwellings in the town that could potentially be sold after this first lot.

But many are former storehouses, stables or shops, so they'll need to be converted to residential use before being placed on the market.

Golden dreams

The abandoned homes going under the hammer all have small panoramic balconies and terraces. Francesco Russo

Salemi has a unique sparkle thanks to the golden warm hue of the campanedda stone adorning the facades of its churches, castle, palazzos and homes, which makes them shine in the sunlight.

Located close to Trapani's airport and the departure harbor for the tropical-like Egadi islands, it's ideally positioned for exploring Sicily's wild areas and stunning beaches.

Surrounded by fields of grazing herds, Salemi sits at the feet of Roses Mountain and is encircled by two pristine rivers, which contribute to its fresh, oxygen-rich air.

While Sicilian summers are notoriously hot, the town is located at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level, a position that generates a refreshing cool breeze.

Visitors can take on various scenic ""archeo-trekking"" routes through the countryside with ruins of fortresses and a necropolis dotted along the way.

The natural reserve of Scopello, popular for its breathtaking sea stacks and open-air tuna factory, is just a 20-minute car journey away, while gold-colored temples of Selinunte and Segesta are just a stone's throw away.

Founded on the ashes of a primitive settlement and later conquered by the Saracens, its name is thought to stem from the Arab word ""Salam,"" which translates to ""healthy and safe"" -- or ""Salem,"" which means ""peaceful.""

A stratification of medieval and Baroque architectures, Salemi slowly unwinds below a majestic Norman castle, when aristocratic mansions give way to simple stone dwellings that previously belonged to farmers and artisans.

The town's main piazza is a crumbled church, while the ruins of its stone apse are still standing near the go-to spot for leisurely sunset strolls.

Its residential layers are connected to the abandoned areas the homes are located in by a maze of narrow alleys.

These forsaken districts form a patchwork of tiny ghost neighborhoods and are a sharp contrast to the town's more lively spots.

Jazz, beer and bread

While Salemi may be in need of more residents, the town definitely isn't lacking when it comes to food and activity.

A jazz festival is held here annually to commemorate American musician Tony Scott, who is buried in Salemi -- Scott's parents were both Sicilian.

A quirky ""little Oktoberfest"" event, where young beer-makers offer a taste of their ales made with local cereal grains, usually takes place in October.

On St. Joseph's Day, Father's Day in Italy, a culinary feast is held during which 101 gourmet dishes are prepared over the course of a week to honor the adoptive father of Jesus.

The event is something of an eating pilgrimage that unravels through the town's districts, where food altars covered in laurels and decorated with artistic bread sculptures and other delicacies are set up, while church altars are adorned with dough masterpieces.

Three children from disadvantaged families are invited inside the church to sit at a banquet and indulge in a series of gourmand plates.

The banquet's ""spiritual menu"" features signature dishes made with local, seasonal products such as polpette meatballs with fennel and broccoli, and omelets with aromatic herbs, alongside Vastedda sheep cheese.

There's also a great deal of impressive bread-making artistry on display.

This tradition hails back to pagan times, when harvest festivities, Sicilian-style Thanksgiving parties, were held to honor Ceres, goddess of abundance, and close out the yearly grain cycle.

You'll find living crèches made of biscuits and breads to symbolize the holy family, with the baby Jesus as a round-shaped bagel and the Madonna as a palm-shaped loaf.

Another standout town celebration is the Festival of the Busiata, where attendees are treated to steaming plates of handmade pasta made from twisting the durum wheat around knitting needles to create an elongated helix shape."
167,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ghana-best-things-to-do/index.html,12 of the best things to see and do in Ghana,"(CNN) — Slotted into the underbelly of Africa's northwestern huddle, Ghana is a country that's steadily reinventing itself.

Known for its colorful culture, wildlife and natural beauty, the West African nation had one of Sub-Saharan Africa's fastest-growing economies in the past few years, thanks to cocoa and a relatively recent discovery of oil.

The economic upturn helped to inject a new lease of life into the arts and fashion scene, leading to a boost in restaurant openings.

While Ghana has no doubt been impacted by the pandemic, the country remains as eclectic and alluring as ever.

The country has long been a mecca for volunteers, and there are many hip and affordable accommodation options available, as well as more high-end hideaways.

A handful of international hotel brands have opened up here over the past few years, but traveling here still feels authentic.

While it's likely be a while before many of us are able to do so due to current travel restrictions -- its borders by land and sea remain closed to passenger travel, there's no harm in planning ahead.

From surfing at deserted beaches, to hanging out with wild elephants, here are some of the top things to do while visiting Ghana .

Visit Cape Coast Castle

Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, Cape Coast Castle was one of around 30 ""slave forts"" built by Dutch, Portuguese and British traders along the country's coastline.

The huge white stone building offers knowledgeable guides who take visitors down to the bleak dungeons where slaves were once shackled, and the Door of no Return, the point they would have been crammed into ships heading for America.

Previous visitors include the Obamas, who came here during their first visit to Africa after the former US President was sworn into office. Michelle Obama's roots have been traced back to slaves taken from this castle.

There's also a fantastic vegetarian restaurant named Baobab café that serves delicious, healthy smoothies and juices.

Visitors can also head inland to Kakum National Park and swing across the rainforest on its 350-meter-long canopy walkway.

Try local, naturally grown foods

Baobab trees are scattered all over the country, and they happen to produce one of the world's most nutrient-dense and antioxidant-rich fruits.

This can be made into a powder, which is wonderful in smoothies, and is said to boost the immune system as well as fight fatigue.

Ghana is also filled with Moringa trees, a powerhouse of proteins and vitamins that aids metabolism. A tea or powder can be made from its leaves.

As for top local dishes, kenkey, made from corn, is sold in most local ""chop bars"" and is definitely worth a try.

Banku, cooked by mixing fermented corn, cassava dough and hot water into a smooth paste, is also very popular.

However, red-red, a stew of black eyed peas made with red palm oil and served with fried plantain, is particularly delicious.

Check out the coastline

Ghana has a chunk of tropical coastline, over 335 miles (560 kilometers) of it, in fact.

There are plenty of fantastic spots to choose from close to Accra, but the beaches are far more pristine slightly further afield.

Ko-Sa Beach Resort, a two-hour drive east from Accra, is run by a Dutch couple and suits all budgets, with beachfront, traditionally constructed buildings with thatched roofs as well as more affordable options.

Children from the neighboring fishing villages come here to sell peanuts and bananas. But their approach is gentle, only adding to the chilled out vibe.

Surf at Cape Three Points

Cape Three Points is one of the best surfing spots in West Africa. Kate Eshelby

Despite Ghana becoming something of a hotspot for surfers, Cape Three Points is one of the few places where you won't have to share the waves.

The wild, rainforest-backed beach perched on the southernmost tip of the country, stretches for almost two kilometers and is practically deserted due to its far-flung location.

Cape Three Points is a six-hour drive from Accra, with the last 40 minutes of the journey along a rough track that can become difficult to navigate during the rainy season.

Those who do venture out here can catch a point break, watch humpback whales migrate or just sway in the hammocks under almond trees while sipping hibiscus juice.

Escape 3 Points Ecolodge owned by Akwasi, a Ghanaian-Canadian with a degree in sustainable architecture, is based on the beach.

Made up of raffia and bamboo-stilted chalets and a dormitory, the eco lodge is electricity free and holds compost toilets.

There's also a communal beach shack with table football that's ideal for entertaining kids, as well as a natural swimming pool at low tide.

Remember to hire a surfboard (Mr. Bright's Surf School in Kokrobite is a good place) before you arrive if you don't already have one. Surf lessons are available from local Brett.

Discover local artisans and craftspeople

While it's often mass-produced, there are many folk weavers around the country who make kente cloths by hand. Shutterstock

One of Ghana's national cloths, Kente was once reserved for kings and queens, but it's now far more widespread.

Traditionally associated with the Ashanti people, the interwoven material with abstract designs is often mass-produced, but folk weavers can be found all around the country.

Adinkra, another traditional cloth, is decorated with symbols, each signifying a proverb or tradition.

Kumasi, the capital city of the Ashanti Region, is the best place to buy traditional cloths.

Artisans are emerging in the country all the time, producing new fabrics and other arts and crafts.

Akosua Afriyie-Kumi, creator of accessories brand AAKS , is one of the most successful.

The designer's handcrafted bags were snapped up by US clothing retailer Anthropologie, which spotted her work on Instagram, and are now sold worldwide.

Stay at a non-profit lodge or hostel

Ghana boasts various nonprofit accommodation options.

The most well-known is lodge Meet Me There, located up in the mountainous Volta Region between the villages of Dzita and Dzita-Abledomi, a two-hour drive from Accra.

This relaxed property features a lovely tropical garden as well as stilted eating area that juts into a beautiful lagoon.

Guests can swim across the lagoon, or paddle in the lodge's pirogue, to reach a seemingly never-ending wild beach.

The lodge's holds double rooms or suites -- the latter being little thatched cottages painted with adinkra symbols.

Activities available include boat trips to the Volta River, visits to local markets or take drumming lessons.

There's also the opportunity to attend a local cult ceremony, which takes place every Friday and is led by a female shaman named Mamishie Rasta.

Locals claim she disappeared into the sea for a few years and returned with magic powers from the ocean.

Meet Me There is linked to local charity Dream Big Ghana, which supports a community learning center, sanitation and health for the neighboring villages.

Meanwhile in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city, nonprofit hostel Tumi is focused on giving underprivileged females the skills to provide for themselves.

Started by a Dutch lady named Milou, its profits go towards sewing and hairdressing train for young and disadvantaged women.

Guests can watch them busily sewing bright African prints in the workshop next door, before the hostel sells their creations.

Small and intimate, with just two rooms and an eight-person dormitory, Tumi is decorated with huge pictures painted by local artists and its curtains and cushions are all made on site.

There's also an outdoor terrace with wooden crates, where guest can eat meals.

Hang out in Accra

Accra is a city without any major attractions, but it still has great charm.

Several areas have been revamped, in particular Osu and the land surrounding the airport, now as trendy and cosmopolitan as it gets.

Here you can find designers shops like Christie Brown, Wild Gecko handicrafts and art galleries like the Artists Alliance

As for restaurants, the Republic is an Accra staple, known for its live music and akpeteshie-based cocktails, a traditional sugar cane alcohol, while cocktail bar Coco Lounge wouldn't look out of place in New York.

Then there's Jamestown, Accra's oldest district, jammed with a vibrant fishermen's shanty town and hordes of colorful boats, all against the backdrop of a red and white lighthouse and former fort.

Although there's much to see, travelers shouldn't be too ambitious with their plans (unless moving around on foot) as Accra's traffic can be challenging -- cars are often stuck in jams for over an hour.

Marvel at wild elephants in Mole National Park

Mole National Park is home to African elephants, kob antelopes, buffaloes, baboons and even warthogs. Shutterstock

Ghana's largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park is home to around 93 species of mammals, including African elephants, Nolan warthogs and spotted hyenas.

One of the park's biggest selling points is how close it allows visitors to get to the wild elephants while on foot.

It also boasts a beautiful on site property, Zaina, West Africa's first luxury safari lodge.

Guests here don't even have to leave to get the safari experience, as it's possible to watch elephants while swimming in the infinity pool.

The lodge is up on a hill, with views sweeping out over a sea of green Rosewood and Shea nut trees.

Its rooms are spacious and air conditioned East African style safari tents with thatched roofs, with the majority directly facing a watering hole.

(CNN) South America's Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, resembles some of the faraway planets monitored by giant telescopes there.

The lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe.

""It is pure visual silence,"" said photographer Andres Figueroa . ""It is amazing. There is absolutely no humidity, and (these conditions) create some striking contrasts.""

There, in that clear, inhospitably arid environment, Figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology, one rooted in the ancient folklore of the Andean people.

Taking along his mobile lighting studio, Figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every July in the Atacama. In his ""Dancers of the Deserts"" series, Figueroa chronicles these festivals, which attract about 200,000 people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in Chile.

Sweden's policies encourage fathers to take just as much leave as mothers

(CNN) When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave.

He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say.

He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns.

Get this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22.

She first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.

The notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled ""A Place Called Home,"" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.

Having moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.

Through the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.

""As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,"" she said. ""The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.""

All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.

I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern

With housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.

""What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,"" she writes in the text accompanying her images.

""The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt.""

The squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.

But since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.

When squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.

Other images show ""The Castle,"" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.

Another of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.

For her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. ""The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,"" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.

""I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.""

Far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.

""My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,"" she said.

""The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs.""

Despite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.

From her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.

""You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,"" she writes. ""You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary."""

The community is beginning to modernize, but it still maintains its traditional ways of living

(CNN) Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani.

Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits.

The Huaorani, which means ""the people"" or ""human beings,"" are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.

Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.

Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.

He set out to show the ""beauty and richness of the culture"" and arouse curiosity in viewers

(CNN) Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May.

May's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of ""Death in Venice.""

It wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were.

Intrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.

""I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture,"" he said. ""I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents.""

The 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.

""Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect,"" he said. ""But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me.""

Ross doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.

""I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' ""

The result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, ""Girls in Justice.""

The images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.

Photographer Richard Ross

One photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.

""I've been here 17 times,"" one girl says.

Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.

""Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year,"" said one girl explaining her past. ""They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do.""

The photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children.

His images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.

Ross recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, ""I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself.""

""She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope,"" he said. ""I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that.""

Ross, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.

But times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior.

He recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.

You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that. Richard Ross

""This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle,"" Ross recalled. ""He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school.""

The child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.

The detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.

Ross is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about ""immediate change.""

He speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.

""I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake,"" he said. ""At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories."""

Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.

His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.

""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said.

With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.

Photographer Pieter ten Hoopen

The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.

One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.

""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said.

The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.

The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.

Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.

Social media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.

The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.

""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.""

The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.

""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said.

He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.""

I build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen

Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.

Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.

Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.

""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.""

How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?

""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun.

""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."""

The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings

(CNN) Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.

Jooney Woodward's ""Best in Show"" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.

While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.

""My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,"" she said. ""I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do.""

Day after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors.

Many of them, he learned, had come from faraway villages, with little or no money, to get medical treatment for their children.

Navigating the country's difficult terrain -- which spans the Andes Mountains to the Amazon -- often means traversing unpaved roads and can make for a dangerous trip.

""The journey, it's very difficult,"" Pun-Chong said. ""People have to cross the mountains or take a boat to cross the river. It can take many days. Just imagine having this trip with a kid with cancer.""

Far from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their children's lives.

""I couldn't get the picture of the families sleeping on the floor out of my mind,"" Pun-Chong said. ""So, I decided to do something for them.""

Since 2008, Pun-Chong's nonprofit, Inspira , has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they undergo treatment. The organization has helped more than 900 families who've come from all over Peru.

Pun-Chong, who lives a few blocks from the shelter and is there almost every day, runs the organization with the help of a small staff and an army of passionate volunteers. He spends every holiday with the families there.

""The kids inspire me every day,"" Pun-Chong said. ""When I'm with these kids, and I feel how strong they are, I understand that there are no problems that we can't resolve.""

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Pun-Chong about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What are some of the obstacles facing these families?

Ricardo Pun-Chong: We have people who come from the Amazon, travel on a boat and from there take a bus. And you're with a sick child, with a fever. Once they reach the city, they don't have any resources. Sometimes they don't even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.

For leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.

CNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?

Pun-Chong: The shelter is a very special place. We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.

I don't want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don't have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.

The families can stay in our shelter as long as they need, and I want them to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people that are with them.

CNN: What is the unique approach you take with the children?

Pun-Chong: Here we live the day-to-day, but we don't talk about tumors and surgeries and cancer. When I go to the shelter, I leave my stethoscope at home. I come in here as Ricardo, not as a doctor. I want each and every one of them to feel special. I try to lift the spirits of these kids who probably have just undergone surgery. I play and have fun with them and make sure that during this hard time, these kids get to just act like kids.

We are doing everything we can to connect and engage with them. We listen to stories, color, paint, play in the park, ride bicycles. We try to give these kids special things and special experiences. I try to make them laugh, to enjoy themselves. I want these kids to play, to learn, to share. I want to help them to be the happiest they can be.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

That is, until she was 15.

That's when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.

His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.

When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.

""There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn't stay silent,"" said De Angulo, now 30. ""I found out that I wasn't alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.""

Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.

In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

""We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal,"" De Angulo said.

The organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.

""I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through,"" said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.

CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.

CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you're working to combat?

Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it's a boy, then you're in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you're a girl, then you're this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.

We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.

We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.

CNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization's legal efforts had?

De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn't want to take my case.

When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we've taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.

When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn't a lawyer, it wasn't the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we've proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.

Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn't take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.

CNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?

De Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.

(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.

It's beautiful because sometimes you are walking in the street and you see someone with a blue ribbon and you just look at their eyes and you know that we're in this together. And you don't have to say any words, but you know that you're not alone.

(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a ""certificate of virginity."" She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.

In 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was ""Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary,"" which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.

In Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.

Kieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of ""maybe more than 50"" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : ""The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.

""Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'""

She was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.

Her story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and ""Everyday in Cambodia"" was named ""outstanding documentary"" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.

Sorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.

""Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking,"" she says. ""It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited.""

AIM also now works with an ""incorruptible"" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.

But Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. ""The demand side really needs to be addressed,"" she says. ""If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold."""

The capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.

The organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity

Organ trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.

That same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.

In Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.

Jeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.

Out of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.

""I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems,"" Jeet Bahadur said.

But many Nepalis do.

During our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.

A patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.

Those lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.

Nepal's 'kidney bank'

We traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.

Here, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.

The district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the ""kidney bank of Nepal.""

For more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.

In the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.

""Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward,"" said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.

'The meat will grow back'

Nawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.

Like many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms. Poor and uneducated, all he has is two cows, a house and a tiny plot of land.

JUST WATCHED Victims tell their story. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victims tell their story. 01:01

Pariyar used to visit Kathmandu to find construction work. He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a ""hunk of meat"" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.

What he wasn't told: the piece of ""meat"" was actually his kidney.

""The foreman told me that the meat will grow back,"" Pariyar said.

""Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'""

""What if I die?"" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.

The foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.

Then he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.

Traffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.

""At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did,"" Pariyar said.

""I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)

""Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff.""

Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.

He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.

""After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day. He has a urinary problem and constant severe back pain.

But he cannot afford a trip to the doctor and is afraid he will die.

""If I die I can only hope for the government to take care of my two children. I don't know if I will die today or tomorrow. I'm just counting my days,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.

Understanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.

There are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.

""The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible,"" Ghimire said.

Indian links

Traffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.

Few hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.

Two brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars

""They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India,"" said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.

But activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.

""It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India,"" Ghimire said.

We noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.

Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.

Since Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.

Activists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.

With the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.

While the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.

Last year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.

Sub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.

""If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another,"" Chand said.

Rajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.

""We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well,"" Ghimire said.

The attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.

But for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late."
183,2015-04-02 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/index.html,Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels,"(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.

But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.

What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.

But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.

Guatamala's past still haunts

Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.

Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.

A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.

There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.

Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.

Explosion in violence

Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.

Prevailing culture of machismo

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.

According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, ""80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed."" This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.

Make an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence

U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls

The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.

""Politicians don't think women are important,"" says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. ""Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.""

Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.

Quiroa says ""They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.""

Signs of progress

Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.

Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.

Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or ""The Powerful,"" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.

Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or ""The Powerful"" share their stories and help other women get support.

The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.

The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or ""Opening Opportunities"". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.

Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. ""They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.""

Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.

The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.

Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.

Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.

Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, ""We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.""

But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.

Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough."
184,2015-03-14 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/14/intl_world/iyw-aid-workers-in-danger/index.html,"Aid workers in ISIS bull's-eye: 'If not us, then who?'","New York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.

The exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.

Abductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.

Not all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.

Here's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.

For ISIS, it appears to matter less. Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook.

These tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'.

""Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now,"" says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . ""There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case.""

The response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.

ISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield.

Yet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.

When CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.

If I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances. I mean, we don't do that, but it's not the exception any more.

My family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is Westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry, I worry about them and that doesn't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work. I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region.

I don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day.

Mark Ohanian, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) director of programs

Fear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks.

It is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger.

If we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing.

Dima (last name withheld), aid worker, IOCC

There's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver.

Michael Bowers, senior director for strategic response and emergencies, Mercy Corps

It's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel.

There may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies.

There's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is ""stay and deliver,"" so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get?

The fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, ""If not you, then who?"" and you ask, ""Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?"""

(CNN) I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago.

I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher.

I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment.

Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety.

When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon.

Intrigued by the strange reaction, Kaldi took the berries to a local monastery, where the monks promptly threw them in the fire disapproving of their apparently magical attributes.

As the berries were roasted by the heat, a heavenly aroma spread, and they were used to make the first coffee.

Or so the legend of coffee goes. What is more certain is that Ethiopia, widely regarded as the cradle of coffee, is a nation devoted to the stimulating beverage. The country is Africa's biggest producer and ranks fifth globally. Last year it exported 190,000 tonnes of coffee beans, earning around $700 million, and in 2016 Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa will host the 4th World Coffee Conference, a high-level gathering of global experts.

One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat.

""My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,"" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. ""The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius.""

Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success.

Just 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.

The cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.

Their ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That’s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.

Other things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.

Men cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don’t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.

Though parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be “pocket parks,” or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.

Here’s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.

This supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities."

The other three defendants, Assad Sabra, Hassan Oneissi and Hassan Habib Merei, were found not guilty at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) in The Hague. The hearing ruled that there was no evidence of their involvement in the bombing.

The special court was set up to try the four suspects, who were charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, intentional homicide, attempted intentional homicide, and other related charges, according to the tribunal website.

The men's whereabouts are currently unknown; the verdict was issued in absentia.

The day-long ceremonies took place at the royal residence, the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. Apart from the Emperor and Empress, numerous other members of the royal family attended the ceremonies, as well as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and representatives from foreign embassies.

""I deeply ponder the responsibility of Crown Prince and will discharge my duties,"" said Akishino in front of the attendees, most of whom were wearing masks, in footage by public broadcaster NHK.

Crown Prince Akishino of Japan leaves the Imperial Palace in a horse drawn carriage in Tokyo on November 8.

The event included the traditional rite of inheriting a ""guardian sword"" for the crown prince. Emperor Naruhito handed down the sword to Akishino, symbolizing the decision of the next successor to the throne.

The event had originally been scheduled for April but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, and was scaled back as infections kept rising. Large events like a celebratory banquet were canceled.

He opened the fridge and saw four different pizza boxes from four different restaurants.

""It's pretty embarrassing, but it's the truth,"" Sklar said. ""I just opened the door, and I was just like, 'What are we doing here?' ""

At 285 pounds (129 kilograms), he would sit on the couch and watch TV, with no energy left after conquering the work day. Late-night snacks included popcorn and ice cream. The 27-year-old, who works in sales for Corporate Strategies in Woodland Hills, California, knew something had to change.

And gradually, his clothes felt like they were getting smaller every time he did laundry.

""It gets to that point where you realize that you're getting bigger; the clothes aren't getting smaller,"" he said. ""It was that a-ha moment.""

There were other epiphanies as well. Sklar missed the feeling he got when he used to play sports as a teenager. And there was a history of heart disease in his family.

Together, he and his girlfriend, Samatha MacDonald, decided to make a lifestyle change. They had talked about doing it before, but this time, it stuck. They didn't want to look back 20 years from now and realize they could have made changes to be healthier then.

Jared and his girlfriend, Samantha, during their lifestyle change.

First, they would start going to the gym. But they didn't want to put in the hours of fitness without having the right diet to fuel it and bring up their energy levels.

Other diets sounded too quick for what Sklar wanted to do. He researched intermittent fasting and decided to try it as a sustainable long-term option.

Sklar and MacDonald would eat their meals between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, creating a 16-hour break before eating again. This helped them kick the late-night snacking habit.

""I like time restricted feeding because it allows you to naturally reduce your food intake without counting calories,"" said Lisa Drayer, CNN contributor and registered dietician. ""You eliminate mindless nibbling in the evening and you're also eating in sync with your circadian rhythm so you're front loading your calories, which is more favorable for weight loss.""

They immediately noticed their energy levels start to pick back up as they swapped out pizza for proteins like turkey alongside vegetables, spaghetti squash instead of spaghetti and Greek yogurt bars instead of ice cream.

""When you're eating only during an eight-hour period, you do want to follow good nutritional guidelines, including protein, fiber, enough fluids in your diet as well,"" Drayer said.

Sklar loved eating healthier options, but sometimes had a hard time getting up to go to the gym. For MacDonald, food was a weakness, but she was excited to get up and work out.

""We pushed each in our weak areas,"" MacDonald said. ""We were on different pages initially but pushed each other to be on the same page, and that was a huge help.""

Sklar was also dealing with a chronic hamstring issue, discovered by his doctor after playing flag football and repeatedly pulling his hamstring before the diet. His doctor recommended low-impact exercise, which led Sklar to try indoor cycling. He went to the gym six days a week and pedaled for 45 minutes each day.

The couple tried working out together, but found they slowed each other down. While Sklar was pedaling at the gym, MacDonald found that working out at a high-intensity interval training studio worked better for her.

Sklar and MacDonald also cut back on carbohydrates and replaced a lot of the red meat in his diet with leaner proteins like fish, chicken or ground turkey. They became more conscious of what they were eating overall, making healthier decisions during their eight-hour window each day.

""If you're only eating in these eight hours, it's powerful to choose what you put into your body,"" MacDonald said.

The first month, he had lost 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) while cycling and starting intermittent fasting. It continued for the next six months. Sklar fell in love with cycling. The combination of the music and the calories burned during each session fueled him to continue.

Sklar also found motivation when a close family member had to undergo triple bypass surgery in October.

""When you see that person in the hospital going through that, you just think to yourself that you never want that to happen to you, and you want to prevent it from happening to anybody else that you know,"" Sklar said. ""That was my why. That was a light bulb moment where I knew I had to not only keep this going, lose the weight for me, but I also needed to keep it going for my future self and everybody else around me.""

Over a six to seven-month period, Sklar lost 95 pounds (43 kg). Eventually, one of the instructors pulled Sklar aside and told him he should start teaching an indoor cycling class. He's been teaching for about six months now.

For MacDonald, the changes have been more mental than physical. She lost 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) and loves feeling stronger.

""On a busy day, the hour I'm going to the gym is something I'm giving myself,"" she said.

When you realize you're gaining more muscle and feeling better every day, you can feel yourself getting stronger. That was a big thing. I had never stayed with a workout long enough to feel those changes after months. It makes me feel better every day to slowly see these changes in my body.""

In the morning, Sklar usually has a glass of water after getting up. Lunch is at noon, followed by snacks throughout the day. Before a workout, Sklar enjoys peanut butter and jelly on a rice cake.

""I teach a spin class at 5:30 at night, then I'll have a protein shake and dinner right after, and then I'll maybe have a small snack at 8:00 p.m. I fast for the rest of the night until noon the next day.""

After the initial weight loss, Sklar and MacDonald are allowing for a little more flexibility if they have a special event. But they are committed to being as healthy and fit as possible for the long-term. Intermittent fasting helped them form healthy habits.

Sklar is also training for a triathlon now.

Sklar is much more energetic and confident after his weight loss.

""There's always something in front of me to keep me motivated, to make sure that I don't fall back into my old habits,"" Sklar said.

Sklar is continuing to fast and maintain an active lifestyle. He's more confident , energetic and positive. Sometimes, old friends and coworkers don't recognize him. As his story spreads, Sklar has been able to reconnect with friends or acquaintances and share advice on weight loss and fitness. Sklar didn't realize how much it would mean to him.

""I found that in the long run, I was doing it for my friends, as well, because they found inspiration from it,"" Sklar said.

Being able to make this lifestyle change with his girlfriend has made all the difference, Sklar said.

""It was hugely beneficial to have a support system with me,"" Sklar said. ""There's always going to be those days where you want to cheat and have a pizza, and just having a support system to keep you in check and being responsible for keeping somebody else in check was really important, to me."""

Sticking to an overall plant-based diet or a diet that includes more plant foods than animal foods could be associated with a 16% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and up to 25% lower risk of early death, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association this week.

The new study adds to ""the substantial body of literature"" suggesting that consuming a plant-based diet is associated with better heart health and lower risk of death, said Casey Rebholz, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and senior author of the study.

""Plant-based diets emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods. Foods derived from plants include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes,"" Rebholz said.

""Animal foods include meat, eggs, dairy, and fish or seafood,"" she said. ""In this study, we did not define plant-based diets on the basis of complete exclusion of animal foods from the diet ... but rather ranked individuals according to their relative frequency of intake of these foods."""

They love to dance and sing. And twice a week, they come to a gym in Cosmo City, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, to box. They are affectionately known as South Africa's ""boxing grannies,"" and these women are juking and jabbing their way to healthier lives.

""My life was on and off, you know -- sometimes good, sometimes bad,"" said 80-year-old Constance Ngubane, who's been coming in to box since the Boxing Gogos (another name for ""grandmother"" in South Africa) program began in 2014. ""But since I started boxing ... I feel young, like I'm 16. But I'm not 16; I'm 80!""

Constance Ngubane says she feels less like her 80 years and more like age 16 when she's boxing.

For these women, boxing is as much a social activity as it is a physical one, and it is that combination that can boost the benefits of exercise. A study from the Mayo Clinic found that physical activities with more social interaction were associated with a longer lifespan.

""I love to mix with the other grannies,"" Ngubane said. ""They are like family.""

The social aspect of longevity has long fascinated researchers, gaining attention alongside more tangible measurables like diet, exercise and smoking.

198,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hanoi-food-best-dishes/index.html,More than pho: 5 dishes every Hanoi visitor needs to try,"Hanoi (CNN) — When former President Barack Obama traveled to Hanoi in 2016, he famously joined the late Anthony Bourdain for a meal of bun cha, a beloved local specialty made up of bits of marinated, charcoal-grilled pork patties and pork slices in a dipping sauce with rice noodles and herb garnishes.

And then of course there's the world-famous pho. Made with rice noodles, this beef noodle soup is a must-try on the streets of Hanoi -- not to mention readily available overseas.

But there's much more to the city's diverse food scene.

Here are five dishes every Hanoi visitor -- not just global leaders -- should try. (And yes, we know, we've barely scratched the surface. For more amazing meals, check out our list of 40 delicious Vietnamese foods .)

Cha Ca (fish cooked with turmeric and dill)

Hanoians consider cha ca to be so exceptional that there is a road in the capital dedicated to these fried morsels of fish -- Cha Ca Street.

Along the busy road, where spiderwebs of exposed electric wires hang overhead, dozens of specialists compete to sell the best cha ca -- crispy turmeric-marinated fish that's fried tableside in a pan with herbs.

The most famous restaurant on this strip is Ca La Vong -- one of the oldest eateries in Hanoi -- and the first to set up shop on Cha Ca Street, over a century ago.

The dish itself dates back more than 130 years. It was first invented by the local Doan family, who served the special meal to troops during French colonial rule.

Banh Tom (shrimp cake)

Deceptively time-intensive, Hanoi-style banh tom, or shrimp cakes, have just a few main ingredients: freshwater crayfish or shrimp from West Lake, flour and sweet potato.

Instead of grinding the shrimp into a paste (like a fish ball), the fried seafood is usually left whole -- sitting atop the crunchy cakes.

It's typically served with lettuce leaves for wrapping, plus chili, lime juice and fish sauce for dipping.

Banh tom is thought to have become common in the 1930s when small street vendors began congregating along Thanh Nien Street -- a road that separates West Lake (Tây Hồ) and Trúc Bạch Lake.

When the hawkers garnered popularity, the government later combined many of the stalls and opened one big restaurant along the waterfront.

Enter Banh Tom Ho Tay . Today, the restaurant remains a fixture on Thanh Nien Street and still draws a steady stream of friends and families, gathering for slow afternoons full of crispy, savory shrimp cakes, chilled bia hoi (local draft beer), and front-row seats to the lake.

Bun Ca (fish noodle soup)

Fresh and light, bun ca combines fried fishcakes, dill, tomatoes, green onions, and perilla -- a mint-like herb.

A lunchtime staple in Hanoi, you can find bun ca (fish noodle soup) just about anywhere.

But Mark Lowerson, founder of Hanoi Street Tours, points to a vendor west of the Old Quarter called Van, that specializes in the dish.

""This is one of the best in town,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""There are two types of noodles, and then your choice of steamed or fried fish.""

While in other countries, adding salt could be considered an insult to the chef -- Lowerson says that's not the case in Vietnam.

""Here, you are expected to use the condiments on the table,"" he explains.

""Add a little lime, vinegar, chili and herbs to achieve the essential balance of salty, sour, sweet and spicy.""

Bun Rieu Cua (crab noodle soup)

Crabmeat is the star of Bún riêu -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup. Dan Tham

Bun rieu is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.

Freshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.

Depending on the region, bun rieu might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish.

Vermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.

Where to try it? There's an excellent bun rieu street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Thọ Xương Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral.

Ca Phe Trung (egg coffee)

Would you like some eggs with your coffee? In Hanoi, ca phe trung -- or egg coffee -- is a local favorite.

Vietnamese ""egg coffee"" -- or Ca Phe Trung -- is a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.

While destinations across the city now serve it, Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang cafe claims to have invented it.

There are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.

The hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature. The strong coffee taste at the bottom of the cup seeps through the egg -- the yellow layer on top -- and is quite thick and sweet, though not sickly."
199,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hanoi-ta-hien-street/index.html,"World's cheapest draft? Where to try bia hoi, Hanoi's 25 cent beer","(CNN) — As soon as the sun sets in Hanoi , Vietnam , there's only one place to be: the corner of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen streets.

Known as ""Beer Corner"", this famous intersection in the Old Quarter lures travelers and residents alike to socialize over ice-cold bia hoi (light Vietnamese draft beer) atop tiny plastic stools.

A visit to Beer Corner isn't just about enjoying a few brews -- it's also a window into the history of the city.

""If you really want to get up close and personal with the culture of a new city, in particular the culture of the local people, you need to stroll the sidewalks, sit on a stool and have a nice cold beer,"" Brett MacDouall, co-founder of Hanoi Beer Tour , tells CNN Travel.

""And that's what I love about Ta Hien Street.""

It's on Ta Hien Street where MacDouall and co-founder Tan Vu met for the first time in 2005.

While chatting over beer, the two men discovered their fathers both fought in the Vietnam War, albeit on opposing sides.

""So here were two boys, both born in 1974 who grew up in the 1980s,"" says MacDouall. ""I suppose you could say, ideologically, we were very opposed.""

""But the first time we sat down over a cold beer and spoke to one another, we realized that our family values were very similar and have become the best of friends.""

Today, the two men aren't just best buds -- they're also business partners, traipsing around the city with travelers to explore and share the city's stories of beer.

Bia hoi basics

The first brewery in Hanoi opened in the 1890s, when the French controlled the city.

""The French brought the beer drinking culture to Vietnam,"" says MacDouall. ""Before that, [people drank] rice wine.""

After the Hanoi beer brewing factory was set up, beer culture caught on quickly.

Today, Vietnam is one Asia's biggest beer-drinking nations, consuming 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.

""It evolved through workers [who enjoyed beer] after a hard day's work,"" says MacDouall. ""It was also curiosity -- people wanted to see what Westerners were drinking.""

At the time, however, the beer was expensive, marketed to the city's upper crust.

It wasn't until the late 1950s that bia hoi was introduced as an affordable options for everyday citizens. A brewery opened on Ta Hien Street, selling the fresh lager at just a few cents a mug.

This local staple is a light and refreshing lager, with an alcohol content of less than 3%.

The idea? You can drink it for long sessions to cool off after working all day in Hanoi's sweltering temperatures.

""Some will actually say it is 'instant beer' like instant noodles, since it is made quickly and sold quickly,"" explains MacDouall.

""The alcohol content is low and that was because people wanted to consume it rapidly.""

Over the years, countless bars and restaurants have populated Ta Hien Street, bring with them swathes of tiny stools and metal tables that flank both sides of the sidewalk.

All new brews

Still today, bia hoi is relatively affordable when compared with international labels. A glass of the light lager could set you back anywhere from 15 to 40 US cents.

But that's slowly changing.

""For local owners, selling bia hoi doesn't create enough money to sustain the business,"" says MacDouall.

""So they would rather sell bottled beer and focus on food. But if you still want bia hoi, this is where you come and get it.""

And if you want something other than lager?

Enthusiasts can easily track down local microbreweries and craft beer bars that pour more creative concoctions.

Furbrew , on the banks of West Lake, for example, serves a 'pho' beer that mimics the flavors of the famous dish with a malty, herby, slightly spicy recipe.

THE GREAT OUTDOORS

Though Japan might be most famous for its dazzlingly modern cities, you'll want to spend at least a few days exploring its stunning natural offerings. This is a nation that truly has it all, from rocky mountain peaks to white-sand beaches.

Here are few Japan experiences that will allow for both relaxation and adventure.

Winter sports

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

Nagano, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998, has long been a snowy escape for global travelers. But in recent years, Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido has become another leading destination for powder hunters thanks to its fresh, quality snow and amazing food scene.

Down on the island of Honshu, meanwhile, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture offers skiing, onsen (more on that later) and ""snow monsters.""

For something completely different, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route , dubbed the ""Roof of Japan,"" offers travelers a chance to drive down a highway framed by massive walls of snow that tower as high as 17 meters over the road.

Beach hopping

It's easy to see why this stunning Iwate prefecture beach was named ""Jodogahama,"" or Pure Land. JNTO

Being an island nation, Japan's beach offerings are just as impressive as its skyscrapers and bullet trains.

In the north of Japan's main island, Jodogahama Beach (Pure Land in English) is a tranquil hidden beach with crystal-clear water and stark white rocks.

If you prefer softer (and darker) sand, Ibusuki Beach is your dream destination. The subtropical beach is famed for a unique activity -- sand bathing, or suna-mushi.

For island hoppers, you can check out a series of 260 tiny pine tree-covered islands in Matsushima.

Onsen soaking

For anyone who hasn't been to a Japanese onsen, take note: Nudity isn't just the norm. It's the rule.

The word ""onsen"" refers to Japan's natural hot springs but it also can represent facilities like spas and inns that pipe the waters into their own bathing areas.

Though thousands of onsen exist throughout the country, Beppu is Japan's hot spring capital -- and for good reason. It's home to more than 2,500 hot springs and is the world's second-largest source of thermal spring water.

For travelers with ink, however, stripping down at a Japanese onsen can get tricky as many ban tattoos, which have been associated with yakuza gangs.

Fortunately, there's Tattoo-Friendly , a website featuring properties that allow ink. Users can narrow down the search by choosing the type of facility they want to visit -- gym, pool, hotel-and-ryokan (inn) or sento (public baths).

Each listed property includes a brief description of the place and its amenities, as well its specific policies on tattoos.

Hanami

For just a few weeks every spring, Japan celebrates an annual ritual known as hanami: stopping to view and appreciate the beautiful spring blossoms.

It's so popular the Japan Weather Association's annual sakura (cherry blossom) forecast is broadcast live on TV, while the Japan National Tourism Organization has a regularly updated timetable of cherry blossoms predictions on their website.

Hiking

Being a mountainous nation, trekking is an extremely popular Japan activity.

For a spiritual journey, try Kumano Kodo , a multiday pilgrimage across Wakayama prefecture -- fueled by great food, cute rural villages and rich culture along the way.

More than a thousand years ago, imperial leaders and aristocrats made their way to the main Kumano Kodo shrines through a network of hikes across the island. At the end of the hike we recommend spending the night at a temple in the mountaintop town of Koyasan , the center of Shingon Buddhism.

Here, ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops.

The enchanting Yakushima forest (the setting for Hayao Miyazaki's epic film Princess Mononoke) on Kyushu island and the Sagano bamboo forest on the outskirts of Kyoto are other family-friendly places to enjoy a quiet walk in Japan.

TRADITION

Japan excels at striking the right balance between tradition and modernity, leading the way in technological advances while also embracing its past, whether it's architecture, art, fashion, food or sports.

Here are a few experiences that will give you a taste for Japan's traditional side.

Looking for that classic Japanese inn experience, complete with tatami floors, onsen and sliding doors?

Staying in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese guesthouse, is the way to go. Catering to all budgets, they can be found throughout Japan -- most commonly in the countryside outside of urban centers.

Guests are encouraged to wear yukata (house kimonos) and socks, while traditional Japanese meals are prepared in-house.

Tea ceremonies

CNN's Paula Newton travels to Fukuoka and the surrounding tea-rich lands to experience the traditional winter tea ceremony.

The Japanese tea ceremony, or chado , is a traditional way of preparing and serving matcha (top quality green tea).

To make it, green tea leaves, grown in the shade, are dried and ground into a fine powder. This allows the tea to retain its nutrients. During the ceremony, which focuses on the rituals and mental states achieved in the process, the powder is whisked with hot water in a small bowl until a slight foam appears.

The top place to experience Japan's matcha tea ceremony -- or just enjoy a few cups of the precious drink -- is Kyoto. There are plenty of tea making classes and demonstrations available in English and other languages.

Kimonos

Japan's most beautiful traditional attire, kimonos are undeniably an expensive souvenir to bring home. One reason for their hefty price tag is the painstakingly detailed process that goes into making them.

Another reputable kimono-making company is Okaju in Kyoto, founded in 1855 and now helmed by the fourth generation Shigeo Okajima.

If you'd simply like to don one during your Japan visit, there are a number of rental companies throughout Kyoto.

Prefer to appreciate these beautiful garments from afar? Kyoto's Gion district is where travelers can view graceful geishas, traditional Japanese entertainers, walking down the street in their kimonos.

Sumo watching

Sumo is as ancient as it is quintessentially Japanese. Historians agree that the sport dates back at least 2,000 years, and in its current form has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period.

But scoring a seat at one of Japan's six major sumo tournaments per year might as tough as getting into the ring and wrestling yourself, though with a little advance planning you can make it happen. Tickets are available through Japan's official sumo website

There are other ways to get close to a sumo wrestler.

When they're not competing, sumo wrestlers train year round in designated sumo stables, or beya.

These stables, which are mostly based in Tokyo's Ryogoku neighborhood, are where the city's wrestlers live, eat, sleep and practice on a near daily basis. In recent years, it's become more common for foreigners to visit the morning practice, which begins at about 5 a.m. and lasts three to four hours.

Sushi

l e v a r t

Chances are, sushi is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think ""Japanese food.""

More than just a slice of fish over vinegar rice -- that is only one type, called nigiri -- mastering the art of sushi can easily take a lifetime. Luckily, there's Sushi University , where travelers can learn to distinguish nigiri from nori-maki.

Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.

Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price range.

If you're up for a splurge, Sushisho Masa (106-0031 Tokyo, Minato City,Nishiazabu, 4 Chome−1−15) in Tokyo's Roppongi neighborhood is nothing short of perfection.

And then of course there's Sukiyabashi Jiro , the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro earned global fame following the 2012 documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi.""

A type of Wagyu beef named after the region in which the cattle are raised, Kobe is relatively rare -- only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade.

This has caused a fair bit of confusion but here's an easy way to remember it. Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline.

The Kansai region, where Osaka is based, produces the three ""king"" varieties of Wagyu: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty.

Soba

Want a seat at Kyourakutei? You'll have to wait in line. CNN meets up with the man behind this popular Michelin-starred Tokyo soba restaurant.

Soba, or Japanese buckwheat noodles, are usually served cold with dipping sauce (called zaru soba) or served hot in dashi broth.

Triumphing over them all is te-uchi, which means ""handmade,"" soba in Japanese. The hand-kneaded and cut soba offers the best firmness and, hence, is more much tastier than the mass-produced variety.

For a truly unique soba experience, head to Iwate, a prefecture in Japan's northeast where you can enjoy a 400-year-old all-you-can-eat noodle tradition called "" wanko soba .""

One wanko soba restaurant claims a diner ate 570 bowls in one sitting.

Yakitori

One of the best reasons to visit a pub in Japan? Yakitori, Japanese style chicken skewers. ©JNTO

A yakitori restaurant is where you can sample every part of the chicken -- from chicken breast to skins to gizzards -- all presented on skewers, Japanese style.

Tokyo's Torikado is one of the best places to enjoy them. A high-end omakase yakitori restaurant, Torikado's diners will leave it up to the chef to decide what they eat.

Another popular way to chow down a few chicken skewers is with a beer at an izakaya, or casual Japanese pub. Here's our selection of the best (and affordable) izakaya in Tokyo

Kaiseki

Kaiseki meals were originally intended to be enjoyed before a tea ceremony.

Japan travelers researching a trip to Kyoto will inevitably come across the word ""kaiseki.""

To the outsider, it appears to simply be a multicourse Japanese dinner made up of beautifully plated dishes. But there's so much more to this meticulously prepared, exquisitely served and, usually, very expensive meal.

To practitioners of this haute cuisine, kaiseki is the embodiment of ""omotenashi,"" which means wholehearted hospitality.

Nothing's more comforting than slurping back a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day.

There are four basic styles of the world-famous soup-based dish: Shoyu (soy sauce seasoning); shio (a light soy sauce version of shoryu); miso (made with fermented soy beans); and tonkotsu (a creamy-white pork bone broth).

CNN Travel asked Brian Mac, founder of the blog Ramen Adventures , to share some of his favorite ramen varieties in Tokyo and beyond, which include Hokkaido's miso ramen, Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen and all kinds of shoyu variations. Read more about them here

Sake

A one-minute tour of Japan's northern Tohoku region, which produces some of the country's best bottles of sake.

Japanese rice wine, sake has a long-standing history dating back to the third century.

It's produced all over the country -- and many brewers are open to tours -- but Japan's Tohoku region in the northeast is where you'll find some of the best bottles.

Part of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku.

For visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tastings -- but you will need to book in advance via their websites."

Kitayama village , located about three hours from Osaka in Wakayama prefecture, offers tourists a chance to discover what it's like to sail down the swift currents of Kitayama River on traditional logging rafts.

Here's the kicker -- you're not even seated.

For the whole time, riders stand in a line on the sturdy, long wooden rafts, clutching only the metal/wooden handles that rise from the base of the rafts.

As terrifying as it looks to be a rider, the true cowboys on this journey are the guides.

Wooden oars in hand, they pilot the rafts down the river rapids while standing, wearing boots, a hat... and no life jacket.

The adventure sport was inspired by Japan's traditional lumber industry, in which felled wood was assembled into rafts then sent down the river -- a transport method used for more than 600 years. In the late 1970s, it was introduced to tourists.

Game? The rafting season lasts from May to September, with reservations accepted from April 1. Days and times vary depending on month. Minimum age to join is 10 years old. Price is 6,000 yen ($53) per adult, 3,000 yen per child."

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy

(CNN) — Let's face the facts. Japan is a popular place.

With close to 30 million international travelers heading there in 2018, tourists visiting traditional hotspots such as Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka during peak travel periods -- say, cherry blossom season in the spring -- will find themselves battling overwhelming crowds.

But the northern region of Tohoku remains surprisingly undertraveled in comparison, making it a fantastic destination any time of year.

Located at the tip of Japan's main island of Honshu, Tohoku is made up of six prefectures: Aomori, Akita, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi and Yamagata, all of which are filled with dramatic landscapes, historical attractions and culinary delights.

Here's a sample of some of the top Tohoku experiences on offer. For even more ideas, click through the above gallery.

Zao Onsen, where snow monsters roar

As winter storms rush though Japan's Zao Mountain Range, trees are transformed into incredible ""snow monsters.""

The Tohoku region gets some of the world's biggest dumps of snowfall each winter, making it a great alternative to traditional ski resort destinations such as the wildly popular Hokkaido to the north.

One of the most foreigner-friendly destinations in the area, Zao Onsen in Yamagata prefecture is well-equipped to welcome powder hunters looking for some time on the slopes.

But the real reason to visit is to see Japan's famed snow monsters -- or ""juhyo"" in Japanese.

Every winter, as Siberian winds rush though the Zao Mountain Range, trees begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice. The trees freeze into fascinating humanesque forms.

To access the snow monsters, head for the Zao Onsen Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks.

It's a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Zao's longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.

l e v a r t

The best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.

If you can't make it in winter, there's still plenty to see. For instance, the gorgeous Okama Crater Lake is surrounded by the three peaks of Tohoku's Zao mountain range.

It was named after ""kama,"" a traditional iron pot that shares its shape, and can be visited in the summer months.

Employed as everything from mascots and resort greeters to train station masters, Japan's adorable Akita Inu dogs -- which originally come from Tohoku's Akita prefecture -- have been charming the nation for decades.

The most famous Akita is Hachito, who was immortalized in film and has his own statue In Shibuya, Tokyo.

According to the legend, Hachito visited Shibuya station every single evening for a year to greet his caretaker after work. Sadly, one day his human friend died while on the job and did not return. Nevertheless, Hachito continued to visit the same spot every day for nine years.

How's that for loyalty?

More recently, a band of Akita dogs was employed by a regional tourism body to create what might just be the strangest pop music video we've ever seen. (Check it out below.)

Want to meet some of these canine cuties in person? Head for Odate, Akita's capital.

The Akita Dog Visitor Center at Odate Station is home to two honorary station masters, while the Akita Dog Museum offers a look at the history of these cute canines.

Wanko soba: An all-you-can-eat noodle binge

At the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, brave eaters can eat as many bowls of soba as they want for 3,240 yen (or $31.80). It's also known as Japan's Wanko Soba Noodle Challenge.

Only for the hungry, the wanko soba challenge is an all-you-can-eat buckwheat noodle binge unique to Japan's Iwate prefecture.

Here's how it goes: A server brings tiny bowls of noodles, laying them down one after another as quick as you can slurp them back.

As soon as you empty a bowl, she'll swoop in to fill it with another mouthful, yelling ""hai dan dan!""

There's only one way to ebb the noodle flow -- put a lid your wanko (bowl).

There are a few rules involved.

For starters, you have to eat continuously. You can't take a break and digest your noodles then come back to the table for more.

We recommend trying it at the Azumaya Soba Shop in Morioka, Iwate's capital.

There are four Morioka locations but the Ekimae branch is just a two-minute walk from the train station and has English-language menus.

Matsushima: Japan's most scenic views

l e v a r t

Matsushima is one of the fabled ""Nihon Sankei"" -- or ""Three Views of Japan.""

More than 260 tiny, pine tree-covered islands dot the waters of Matsushima Bay, creating a scene that's been the muse of dozens of Japanese poets and artists through the ages.

To truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station. Several islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island.

Home to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints.

Nearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.

To explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms.

Doesn't hurt that the food's amazing in Matsushima, too.

""Seafood in the Matsushima area is considered of the highest quality because the seafood harvested in the area benefits from the nutrient-rich water and plankton found off its coast,"" says award-winning author Hiroko Shimbo, an expert on Japanese cuisine who organizes culinary tours through the country.

""In addition to oysters there are such local specialties as salmon, skipjack tuna (katsuo), Pacific pike (sanma), northern clam (hokkigai), asari clams, abalone (awabi), scallops (hotategai) and the best-quality wakame (sea vegetable) -- don't call it seaweed!""

The small but substantial Matsushima Fish Market is a fine place to kick off a culinary tour of the town.

Vendors here serve everything from ramen and sushi to oyster croquette burgers.

Sendai: Japan's beef tongue capital

l e v a r t

Though gyutan -- beef tongue -- is available at yakiniku restaurants all over Japan, Sendai is where you'll find the highest concentration of eateries solely dedicated to grilling up these juicy strips of meat.

The original beef tongue restaurant is Aji Tasuke, founded in 1948 by a man named Keishiro Sano.

He left Sendai to apprentice in Tokyo around 1935. It was there that he met a French chef, who he saw cooking up a beef tongue stew. Inspired, he decided to prepare it differently to suit Japanese tastes.

After World War II ended, he returned north and opened a restaurant in Sendai. Due to food shortages, he began serving his take on beef tongue, along with tail soup.

Seven decades on, Sano's photo still hangs on the wall and the restaurant is still going strong, now run by his eldest son.

And it's got competition. Nowadays you can't turn a corner in the center of this city of one million people without seeing a restaurant advertising gyutan -- ""gyu"" is Japanese for cow, while the ""tan"" refers to the English word for tongue.

Yamadera, one of Japan's most beautiful temples

Those willing to climb the site's 1,015 stairs are rewarded with great views — and maybe even a bit of luck.

You're going to have to work a bit to enjoy this one.

The stunning Yamadera Risshakuji Temple complex is located on Mount Hoju-san in Japan's Yamagata prefecture. But here's the kicker: You have to walk up 1,015 stairs to reach it.

Though its official name is Risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as Yamadera -- which means ""mountain temple.""

The temple complex, founded in AD 860 to oversee the northern Tohoku region's Tendai Buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.

Climbing the staircase is intended to be a meditative experience and is said to bring good luck to those who reach the top.

Like many of Japan's attractions, this one is beautiful no matter the season but we recommend going in fall or winter, when the views of the Yamagata countryside are particularly spectacular.

Getting there is easy. Yamadera Station is about a 40-minute train ride from Tohoku's biggest city, Sendai, in neighboring Miyagi prefecture.

When it comes to traditional arts, Tohoku is where you'll find some of the country's most impressive ancient crafts -- still being produced by skilled artists to this day.

There's magewappa, or bent woodware, a traditional craft that originated in Akita and is used to make bento boxes, steamers and other items.

203,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/bamboo-scaffolding-artisans-macao/index.html,Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works,"Written by Stella Ko, CNN Macao

Many of Asia's biggest cities owe their skylines to long bamboo poles that allow construction workers to climb to great heights.

This type of scaffolding has been used for centuries in places like Macao, where two architects are now trying to change local perceptions by transforming the poles into works of art.

Rita Machado and João Ó, founders of the design studio Impromptu Projects, have teamed up with local bamboo masters, who are known as ""spiders"" for their deft and dangerous work on the web-like structures.

""We formed a kind of friendship where the masters share their knowledge and we show their work,"" Machado says.

Early uses of bamboo

Bamboo has long been used for construction in parts of Asia where it grows plentifully and rivals steel in strength and durability. It grows incredibly quickly -- and up to 8 meters (26 feet) high -- making it a sustainable building material that has endured for centuries.

The poles were once used to build huts and small-scale projects, though bamboo grids stretching hundreds of meters into the air alongside modern high-rises are now a common sight.

The merging of old and new is a central theme in Ó and Machado's bamboo projects. And Macao, with its blend of Portuguese and Chinese history, offers a rich palate for them to work with.

Preserving Macao's bamboo tradition through sculptural works

The first Portuguese settlers arrived in Macao in the 1500s and it soon became an important hub along Portugal's Asian trading route. Portuguese influences can be seen in the European architecture and the distinctive blue and white tiles that the merchants imported on their ships. Chinese influences are also apparent, especially in the A-Ma Temple, built in 1488, one of the city's oldest buildings.

In 2005, the city's historical center was added to the World Heritage List as a place of outstanding universal value -- an accolade it owes, in part, to bamboo.

Every year, residents build a bamboo-shed theater outside the A-Ma Temple to pray for the safety of fishermen at sea. It's a tradition that has endured in this port city for more than 100 years -- one that captured the attention of the two architects, who live next door.

""This kind of annual renewal of ancestral technology is amazing,"" says Machado. ""We re-adapted this knowledge that already existed in the city and created a new form of expressing ourselves.""

Beyond simply expressing themselves, the designers want to draw attention to a skill that is in danger of dying out.

Macao's 'spiders'

Macao's humid summers and tightly-packed buildings produce challenging conditions for the territory's remaining bamboo scaffolders.

Chio Seng Wai has been in the industry for nearly 50 years. In that time he has erected hundreds of skeleton frames with his bare hands, instinctively judging the correct length of the bamboo poles and how they should be assembled. Over the years, he's worked on commemorative arches, swimming sheds and buildings that stretch up dozens of stories.

His knowledge can only be passed down through intensive physical training, but in recent years there have been few candidates willing to learn.

""Young people are not interested in this field because it is dangerous, working in high elevation above the ground, and it is hard labor under the strong sun,"" says Chio. ""We are old and have to retire, but we want to take our industry global to spread our culture and crafts.""

There are fewer than 50 bamboo experts left in Macao, Chio says. This statistic alarmed the Impromptu Projects team, which has closely observed the scaffolders as they work.

""The width of the grid in the scaffolding is the length of their arm and the height is their legs, so they can interlock it and use their hands freely,"" explains Ó.

""Their way of interlocking and grabbing the bamboo poles and breathing follow certain forces in their environment,"" he continues. ""We came to understand that their positions on the bamboo structure were very close to tai chi movements.""

Reviving a dying profession

The bamboo designs may take shape in the architects' studio, but the real work happens outside. Using 3D models, the bamboo artisans set about recreating their vision, lifting and tying each pole by hand.

""Bamboo used in our structure is always the second, third, or the fourth life of the scaffolding used previously, and the material again returns back to other construction sites,"" Machado explains.

The architects say it is important to show their work to the local community, so residents appreciate bamboo scaffolding as art, not just a tool.

Ó and Machado believe that having scaffolding workers engage in the art scene will help keep the tradition -- and an endangered profession -- alive.

""We see the craftsmen as artisans, not just the low-ranking construction industry workers,"" says Ó. ""This idea of renewal of the technology and ancestral knowledge passed verbally or visually -- it's a continuation of the local identity.

""We feel responsible to extend this knowledge to the next generation."""

Perched on a stool in his dusty workshop in Macao, Lam Weng Io looks like a scholar or a librarian, bespectacled and in deep concentration.

With steady hands, he carefully guides a sheet of red acrylic through a cutting machine.

For more than 30 years, Lam has been creating handwritten storefront signs in the former Portuguese colony as a full-time typographer. In each of his characters, Lam aims for a trifecta of balance, clarity and liveliness.

Hundreds of the 65-year-old's signs can be seen all over Macao, a special administrative region that was handed back to China in 1999 after centuries of Portuguese rule.

They're written in traditional Chinese characters -- which are more complicated and contain more strokes -- as opposed to the simplified Chinese characters that were adopted by the mainland in the 1950s, when Macao was still a European colony.

Adorning the entrance to Lam's workshop-cum-abode are bright red letters, wishing good fortune in the Year of the Pig. As he works, wall of white paper scrolls covered with Chinese poems and aphorisms flutter in the breeze.

The machine hums and slices. Lam shifts the sheet this way and that.

After a few minutes of intense focus, Lam frees a word from an acrylic sheet. He holds it up to light, inspects the grooves.

""門."" Chinese for ""gate.""

Photographed above is a Chinese character for ""gate."" Credit: CNN

While this particularly character is usually written as two nonadjacent radicals that look like saloon doors from a Western movie, Lam's 門 comes out in one piece, with the stylized flourishes of a brushstroke.

Lam says he was noticed for his penmanship from an early age.

""I've always been interested in Chinese characters,"" Lam says. ""When I was a student, other classmates would ask me to write characters for them, because they liked the look of my handwriting. When I got older, people told me that I should open my own business.""

Lam's signs advertise doctors' offices and grocery stores, real estate agencies and apartment buildings.

But Lam says business has been slow lately, because shopkeepers across Macao are opting for cheaper, digitally-produced signs over his traditional ones.

""In the digital age, many people don't need you to write for them,"" Lam says. ""I've received fewer customers.""

But technology hasn't spelled total doom for Lam's typography business. In 2014, a chance meeting led Lam to local typeface designer, Benny Tang Pou I, a long-time fan of his work. Tang's award-winning work includes fonts that emulate birds in flight and the cobblestoned streets of Macao.

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Together, the two decided to digitize Lam's handwriting, with every stroke in every character replicated on Tang's computer and immortalized as a typeface.

""I would say that handwritten signs, like Mr. Lam's, convey more emotion and humanness,"" the 38-year-old says. ""A digitally-produced sign feels lifeless.""

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Credit: Dan Tham/CNN

Tang scans the characters onto his computer and then adjusts the shape of the strokes to create more uniformity. So far, he's digitized around 300 of Lam's Chinese characters, a process that took six months. He aims to convert up to 13,000 by the end of the project, which could take more than five years.

On a stroll near the Ruins of St. Paul's, Lam and Tang point out the signage that carries Lam's trademark style. Pausing in front of a barber shop, the two are greeted by the storeowner. They explain that Lam had written his storefront sign. The three men step back and admire his handiwork.

For Tang, these kinds of traditional signs do more than convey information to passersby. They can help to define a city's aesthetic and cultural identity.

""Certain things here (in Macao) are slowly fading away,"" Tang says, ""Like Mr. Lam's signs. If we don't take action to preserve his font now, there might not be an opportunity in the future."""

The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's Café e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

A family affair

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's Café e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

206,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/shipbuilding-macao-artisans/index.html,The master shipbuilder keeping Macao's maritime past alive -- in miniature,"Zahra Jamshed , CNN Macao Written by

Master shipbuilder Tam Kam Chun is on a mission. Every day, the 71-year-old spends hours at an abandoned Macao shipyard, hunched over a table, hard at work. With only stray dogs for company and a single electric fan to keep him cool, he meticulously hand-crafts the sort of fishing boats that have been made here for generations.

But none of his creations will ever set sail. In fact, Tam's boats are miniatures designed to preserve the city's disappearing heritage.

""There is so much history in the fishing and shipbuilding industries,"" he says. ""I make model boats to show the craftsmanship and the building process (and) to educate people.""

For centuries, the shipping industry was at the heart of life in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that was transformed from a small fishing village to a major port. In recent years, however, casinos have taken over as the city's main source of income.

Historic ship replicas nod to Macao's maritime past

And with mainland China able to produce state-of-the-art metal fishing vessels, quicker and at lower costs, demand for traditional wooden boats all but disappeared.

No new boats have been made here since 2006. Not full-sized ones, at least.

Three years ago, Tam -- who is considered a ""sifu,"" or master, of his craft -- was commissioned by a local temple to recreate a so-called ""junk"" boat in miniature form. He has since produced more than a dozen replicas of the very boats he spent his career making.

""We're not just building models,"" he said. ""It's about craftsmanship, shipbuilding and history.""

Turning the tide

Tam's makeshift studio lies in an abandoned shipyard in Macao's Lai Chi Vun village. The space, which is crumbling at its edges having endured several of the region's worst tropical storms, is a shadow of its former self.

But for Tam, working in the very places he spent his youth is about more than finding a convenient studio -- it allows him to reminisce about the industry's boom era.

Shipbuilding in Macao hit its peak in the 1950s, when there were almost 30 shipyards across the region. By the 1980s however, the industry was in steep decline. Today, the wooden junks that once dotted the shores of Macao, and neighboring Hong Kong, have ceased to exist, save for a handful of tourist boats.

""We thought it would go on for (a) long (time), we didn't see it coming,"" he recalls. ""I wonder how it went downhill so fast. How could I have known this would happen in my generation?""

According to Tam, this decline didn't just affect shipbuilders, but all aspects of life in Lai Chi Vun.

""At the (industry's) peak, people were rushing to work and it was lively. Those were happy times. We would work all year round and have people here dining together. Now, no one comes here to work, so no one comes here to talk to you.""

'Like a human body'

Tam believes that the miniature boats he creates are more than just models.

""The shipbuilding process is the same,"" he said. ""The only difference is the tools used.""

Tam says he uses the same building techniques on his miniatures, as he used on his real ships. Credit: Herbert Chow

The complex techniques and precision required mean that Tam can spend up to 700 hours building a single boat, and will spend three months on each miniature on average.

""At our age, our eyes are not so good,"" he adds, ""so we are slower and can hardly see when it gets very dark... the small parts require more effort.""

There is no room for error, with almost every component supporting another.

""It's just like a human body -- every part is important. If you don't have hands or feet, you can't eat or walk. No one part is more important than the other -- without each part, the boat cannot be completed.""

In 2018, Macao's government recognized the Lai Chi Vun shipyard as a cultural heritage site. But the future of this craft -- and the culture surrounding it -- is dependent on the next generation, he says.

""Some people have started (providing miniature shipbuilding) classes in order to teach young people these skills, and to promote this culture,"" he adds.

""You need people to help with the preservation -- without the help of people, these skills will be lost."""
207,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/tokyo-2020-olympics-rugby-world-cup-tourists/index.html,Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital,"(CNN) — With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.

So what will sports fans notice when they travel here?

First of all, they won't be alone.

Tourism in Tokyo is already booming. Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.

However, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.

Rugby World Cup kicks off this week

The city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.

Most of those will be from rugby heartlands: the British Isles, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.

Tokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.

Unless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.

This is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.

Both are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.

""What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,"" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.

While the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as ""The Brave Blossoms"" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.

""I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,"" says Ota.

Tokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.

""Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.""

The 'Olympics effect'

l e v a r t

Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

It's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for ""dramatic change.""

""This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,"" said Koike.

Major developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.

Featuring a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

The area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.

This includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.

Another hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.

Other changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen ""bullet train"" stations.

To assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.

New Olympics sporting venues

In terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.

Located on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.

On top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.

Visiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.

It will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.

Book those hotel rooms now

According to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.

Among the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.

The original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.

However, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.

Stricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.

Other stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.

While most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.

But counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.

For instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.

""No need to worry""

Regardless of the potential disruptions, many, like taxi driver Masaru Okano, are looking forward to Tokyo hosting these huge events and the longer-term changes to Tokyo that are expected.

The 69-year-old has been learning English, and some Korean, for the last few years to provide a better service to the growing number of foreign visitors he finds in his cab.

""When I give them a ride, I always ask where they came from and I try to greet them in their language,"" he says."
208,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/shibuya-crossing-tokyo-japan/index.html,Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing: Welcome to the world's wildest intersection,"Tokyo (CNN) — Often referred to as the world's busiest crosswalk, thousands of pedestrians scramble across Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing daily.

At peak times, the hypnotic pace of the changing traffic light seems to signal the masses into a mesmerizing, yet claustrophobic, waltz.

For many, the controlled chaos of Shibuya's ""Scramble"" epitomizes the efficient madness of the cutting-edge city. Here, 10 lanes of traffic and five major crosswalks converge along a modern canyon of neon-colored buildings in the heart of Tokyo.

The Shibuya Crossing serves as center-stage for a Times Square-inspired New Year's Eve countdown and is the focal point for the wild Halloween celebrations that have grown increasingly famous in recent years.

l e v a r t

Its popularity is easily explained.

Along with Shinjuku Station, the district's Shibuya Station bears the honor of being one of the world's busiest train stations.

Connecting to popular areas such as Shinjuku, Harajuku and Roppongi, it's almost impossible to bypass Shibuya on a visit to Tokyo or even a trip across town. And you wouldn't want to, anyway.

Movers and shakers

Movie buffs will appreciate the fact that ""The Fast and the Furious"" famously slid through the technicolor crossing in the movie series' third installment ""Tokyo Drift.""

Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray fans may remember the ""Lost in Translation"" film scene featuring a sea of clear umbrellas overtaking the intersection. And in the Japanese cult classic ""Battle Royale,"" the crossing stood as a futuristic cityscape in the flick.

It's both a place to see and be seen. Models, and those who would be, strut through the crossing as if on a personal catwalk. It's not uncommon to spot a mascot shimmying across, and there always seems to be a heat of MariCar racers zipping by.It's both a place to see and be seen.

Even during major events such as Halloween, the street remains functional with officials squeezing people onto the sidewalks with retractable ropeways. No matter how busy, traffic at this massive intersection is rarely congested. Emergency vehicles even make their way through rush hour crossings with ease.

In the lead up to the 2020 Olympics, the area has seen significant development and an ever-expanding skyline. The crossing itself undergoes near daily upgrades, with newer and more impressive video boards constantly vying for the attention of passersby.

There are no fewer than five major screens with video and audio impressively synced to each crossing, displaying information such as the weather forecast, during red ""no walk"" signals and often cartoons when the green ""walk"" signal lights up.

The world's most loyal dog

A famed Shibuya meeting spot is this one, epitomized by a legendary, loyal dog. Joshua Mellin

Even though the crosswalk can be a dizzying place, there's one landmark everybody knows: a famed meeting spot epitomized by a legendary, loyal dog.

Hachikō the dog was an akita who would meet his owner Hidesaburō Ueno at the Shibuya Station after work every day in the 1920s. When Ueno died unexpectedly, Hachikō continued to visit the station every day for almost a decade.

His loyalty has become revered in Japan where he is known as chūken Hachikō or ""faithful dog Hachikō,"" and the breed is especially popular in the district.

Today, a near constant line of visitors waits outside the station's exit named for him to take photos with a bronze statue of Hachikō, sometimes offering a wreath of flowers in the summer or a hand-knitted scarf during the colder months.

(Hachikō was still alive and present for the statue's initial unveiling in 1932, but that model was recycled for the war effort, and the current statue is a 1984 remake.)

Even the district's buses and vending machines are adorned with his smiling puppy face, and there's an official Hachikō mascot who frequents the area.

Best viewing platforms

One of the images most associated with Japan is a bird's-eye view of the frenetic crossing. It's a highly sought after image but can be challenging to obtain.

By far the most popular place to snap photos is shopping mall Magnet by Shibuya 109's seventh-floor viewing platform. Standing directly over the crossing, it offers the most immediate angle.

Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., the cost of admission has varied seasonally since opening in 2018, but as of late has been free of charge.

The deck is equipped with a camera that, for a small fee, can sync to a visitor's smartphone to take selfies from above. The platform is not accessible for baby carriages or wheelchairs.

While the crossing isn't directly visible from train platforms, a bridge in Shibuya Station over the street offers a unique side perspective, and it's the easiest to access. That area of the station doesn't even require a ticket purchase.

A cross-hatch design in the windows makes it a little more difficult to capture the perfect photo, but with ample space and indifferent commuters, it's an easy place to stake a spot.

The Shibuya Hikarie building, which houses offices, shops and theaters, is one of the best places to take in a wider view of the district's full action.

A couple blocks from the main crossing, this taller viewpoint on the 11th floor gives an expansive sight of the crossing over the train station. The comings and goings of the trains add another layer of complexity to the endless rush hour below. Though not an official viewing platform, it is accessible and open to the public.

Shibuya Scramble Square -- a new 47-story skyscraper that's the district's tallest tower and has the highest observation deck -- casts all of these in its shadow. The glass-walled rooftop deck features a 360-degree platform for dramatic views across the megacity.

In addition to a dizzyingly high view overlooking the Shibuya district along with sights of Tokyo Tower and Mt. Fuji, the spacious rooftop includes a green space in the astroturf helipad, stairway seating to take in the sunset and hammocks for cloud watching (though signs note no sun bathing).

Tickets are available via the website , with advance purchases providing a small discount.

While there is certainly no shortage of amazing Shibuya views, the best place to connect to the spirit of the Shibuya Crossing is the street itself.

In the span of just a few crossings, an impromptu limbo line may break out, even a dance-off could go down. There's a sense of wonderment from the glowing neon and a connection in the energy among the people."
209,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/crazy-house-dalat-vietnam/index.html,The story behind Vietnam's 'Crazy House',"(CNN) — Wild, weird, wonderful... there are many ways to describe the Crazy House (also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse) in Dalat, a relaxed mountain resort town in southern Vietnam

One thing's for sure: This ""crazy"" complex is one of a kind.

Standing in stark contrast to Dalat's French colonial villas, the bizarre avant garde guesthouse is a maze of spiral staircases, sculptural bedrooms, undulating surfaces, swirls of bright colors, narrow bridges and hidden nooks.

The artist behind the structure, 79-year-old Dang Viet Nga, says it's the ultimate expression of her imagination.

""Crazy House is a culmination of my life and creativity -- it all came together in this structure,"" Dang, daughter of Vietnam's former general secretary Truong Chinh, tells CNN Travel

""I wanted to create something original, pioneering -- different from anything else in the world.""

An exercise in creativity

After earning a PhD in architecture in Moscow, Dang worked for several years in Russia then moved to Hanoi, where she worked on government projects.

On a business trip to Dalat, Dang says she fell in love with the lush landscape, cooler climate and kind people and hoped to eventually move there.

In 1983, she relocated to Dalat with her then 8-year-old son, Nguyen Viet Thang.

After years of working on state-owned developments, which afforded little creativity, she felt compelled to unleash her imagination.

In February 1990, she drew up plans for Crazy House. But instead of blueprints, she created a series of paintings to communicate her fantastical vision.

As a form of expressionist architecture, the house has no right angles but rather organic forms that are designed to mirror natural elements, like mushrooms, shells, caves and spiderwebs.

Dang Viet Nga, artist “Crazy House will never really be finished. It's like a living thing. It is always changing.”

""With this form, you have to try to free your mind,"" she says. ""There are no rules -- aside from basic structural principles [to make sure it's safe and stable] -- it's all about self-expression.""

When it came time to construct the house, Dang used various types of materials, including steel, wood and concrete.

""My mother used a lot of concrete because it's inexpensive and very easy to play with,"" says her son Nguyen, who is now 44.

""Since she can create whatever shape she wants, it reflects what she is envisioning in her mind.""

Less than a year later, the guesthouse was open for business and welcoming its first guests.

Closer to nature

Today, Crazy House feels like woodland fantasy brought to life.

""I felt that, over the last century, people have really destroyed nature. Not just in Vietnam, but around the world,"" says Dang. ""So I wanted to create a structure that brings people closer to nature.""

An elevated main house, which looks like it belongs in Hansel and Gretel, sits in the center of an open courtyard, surrounded by four enormous tree houses.

The Crazy House has been welcoming guests since 1991. Courtesy Crazy House

Sinuous cement ""branches,"" which double as bridges, twist and wind between the various houses so people can move from one to the next.

At first glance, the surreal structures recall mind-bending scenes from a Salvador Dali painting or perhaps even the organic works of modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.

The playful style continues within the tree houses, where 10 guest rooms -- each named after an animal or type of plant -- are full of organic shapes, cavern-like beds, and wooden seating areas.

""Reconnecting nature is one message that I want to communicate with the house,"" says Dang.

""But it's also a message to others to think outside of the box. Don't limit yourself by the rules and the expectations -- free your mind and let your imagination run wild.""

Following her own advice, Dang is continues to dream up new additions to the property while Nguyen now manages the business.

She is currently dreaming up two new gardens -- a Land Garden and a Sky Garden -- to add more greenery and flowers, as well as another tree house.

""I would say that Crazy House will never really be finished,"" says Nguyen. ""It's like a living thing. It is always changing.""

How to visit

In addition to staying in one of Crazy House's guest rooms, visitors can also tour the Dalat attraction for a fee. Though there's no restaurant, visitors can purchase drinks and snacks at a stall in the garden."
210,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hoi-an-vietnam/index.html,"7 reasons to visit Hoi An, one of Vietnam's most beautiful towns","(CNN) — Set on the banks of the Thu Bon River in central Vietnam , Hoi An is easily one of the most beautiful towns in Southeast Asia.

The action revolves around the atmospheric Old Town -- a colonial-era trade port that was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in 1999 -- where dreamy canals, French-colonial merchant houses, Japanese bridges, Chinese shophouses and low-key restaurants vie for your attention.

In the quarter's slow-paced laneways, foliage tumbles from shophouse rooftops and residents pedal by on bicycles, unfazed by the heat. Come evening, rows and rows of silk lanterns glow against the inky sky.

And with a few more high-profile international hotels in the works, including the upcoming Alila Hoi An in 2020 and Rosewood Hoi An in 2021, the historic town of just 120,000 people is firmly on every savvy traveler's radar.

Here are seven great reasons to pack your bags and travel to Hoi An:

A whole lotta history

Vietnam's basket boats can be spotted in the waters around Hoi An and nearby Da Nang. Joel Santos

Once a major player in the coveted spice trade, Hoi An served as a busy Asian trading port between the 16th and 19th centuries.

The city attracted merchants from Japan, China, Portugal and France, and the resulting cultural milieu remains visible in everything from the mustard-colored shophouses to dining traditions, folk crafts and robust coffee culture.

You can feel it at the major landmarks, too. On the western end of Old Town, narrow pedestrian streets give way to an 18th-century Japanese covered bridge while ancient ancestral homes, such as the Tan Ky House, mix together Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese architectural traditions.

Delicious food

Hoi An is the banh mi capital of Vietnam. Kate Springer/CNN

Hoi An is commonly considered one of Vietnam's best destinations for food lovers and it delivers on the hype.

You'll devour every kind of food experience here -- graze street food snacks from roadside vendors, slurp noodles on plastic stools, enjoy fresh seafood by the beach or shell out for a splurge.

You'll find a kaleidoscope of tropical fruits and street food at the Central Market, while local signatures like white rose dumplings (made of shrimp or pork with shallots wrapped in translucent rice paper) and crispy cao lầu (a noodle dish starring pork belly and rice crackers) make appearances on most local restaurant menus.

Lest we forget the cultural mash-up that is the banh mi. Some of the city's best banh mi -- stuffed with pate, barbecued pork, chili sauce and vegetables wrapped inside crispy baguettes -- can be found in Old Town at spots like Madame Phuong or Madam Khanh the Banh Mi Queen

There are few chain restaurants in sight. Instead, family-run cafes and restaurants are the norm -- most of which have open-air balconies and no-frills furniture.

Worthwhile souvenirs

Let's just say you might want to bring an empty suitcase.

There are high-quality souvenirs tempting you at every corner, from silk tailoring shops and custom leatherware workshops to coffee roasters, handmade ceramics stalls, beautiful bamboo lantern makers and contemporary home decor boutiques.

There's nothing kitschy about these goods -- in fact, you might treasure a suit tailored in Hoi An or a leather carryall for years to come.

When it comes to tailoring, shops such as Sam Ao Dai , Hung An Cloth Shop (653 Hai Ba Trung) or Sewing Bee Tailors can turn around an order the next day. But if you're not in a hurry, we'd suggest allowing time for alterations.

For a more couture experience, Yaly Couture and A Dong Silk specialize in bespoke, luxurious apparel that would be appropriate for everything from boardrooms to ballrooms.

Another area where Hoi An's contemporary designers shine is homeware accessories.

The light and airy Sunday in Hoi An boutique, for instance, is full of beautiful hand-painted tiles, bamboo furniture, eco-friendly apparel, bedding and bath accessories.

Beautiful beaches

Hoi An is more of a river town than a beach getaway, but sunseekers can easily reach the coastline.

About a 10-minute drive northeast, travelers will find themselves overlooking the East Sea with sweeps of sand running for miles in both directions.

My Khe might be the most famous strip, but An Bang Beach is the most beautiful. Along this tranquil and largely undeveloped shoreline, it's all about low-key beach shacks, chilled beer and live music.

Another safe bet are the beaches around the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve about 25 minutes north by car, where the water's clean and clear.

A biker's paradise

Whether you prefer to pedal around on a bicycle or zip off on a Vespa, Hoi An's wide open country roads are ideal for exploring on two wheels.

The city just launched a new bike-sharing program in June and most hotels offer bike rentals.

It's easy to gently cruise through Old Town, or you can cycle over to Cam Nam Village, the island just to the south across the river, for a peek at rural life.

For countryside tours, Vespa Adventures is your best option.

On the back of a restored 1960s-era Italian scooter, these half-day excursions take travelers across Thu Bon River on a local boat, over a rickety bamboo bridge, across gleaming green rice paddy fields where water buffalo soak up the sun.

World-class hotels

The Four Seasons The Nam Hai is one of the area's most luxurious hotels. Four Seasons

Often jumbled into a two-for-one vacation, Hoi An and nearby Da Nang -- just 15 minutes up the coastline -- play host to some of Vietnam's most alluring hotels.

Brought to life by prolific resort designer Bill Bensley, the contemporary oasis spills across the hills of the Son Tra Peninsula, a nature reserve that's home to rare red-shanked douc monkeys and pangolins.

Then there's Four Seasons Resort The Nam Hai along the coastline, where you can dine on upscale Vietnamese street food at beachfront restaurant La Sen or splurge on a spa treatment.

Nearby, Fusion Maia has become synonymous with wellness paradise, promising guests unlimited (and all-inclusive) spa treatments.

As well as the Alila Hoi An coming up soon, the area will also welcome the Dusit Thani Hoi An as well as a beachfront Rosewood Hoi An in 2021.

Side trips galore

On a hillside in Vietnam, giant hands extend, holding a new steel bridge. Designed by TA Landscape Architecture, the bridge has attracted scores of visitors since opening.

And if you grow weary of Hoi An's charms and grace? In that unlikely scenario, there are lots of side trips around the region.

If you're into history and architecture, Hue -- the imperial capital set on the picturesque Perfume River -- deserves an overnight visit.

A three-hour drive north from Hoi An rewards history buffs with major sites like the tombs of the ancient emperors, various citadels and pretty pagodas.

Outdoorsy types will appreciate the Marble Mountains. Easy to access from either Hoi An or Da Nang, a set of stairs leads to Buddhist pagodas hidden inside the limestone grottoes."
211,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/vietnam-most-beautiful-places/index.html,30 of Vietnam's most beautiful places,"(CNN) — Thanks in part to its serpentine shape and lengthy coastline, Vietnam is home to wildly diverse landscapes.

As you travel around the Southeast Asian country, you'll be surrounded by photogenic scenery -- from lush rice terraces in northern Sapa to the white sandy beaches of Phu Quoc.

Vietnam's architecture is particularly notable, too.

As a French colony from 1887 to 1954, the country is also peppered with historic government buildings and merchant houses along crucial trade routes -- such as Hoi An, in central Vietnam.

There's more to Vietnam's diverse noodle scene than pho. You'll be seeing red when you tuck into a bowl of bun rieu, a crab-based vermicelli soup.

The mighty Mekong adds to the diverse scenery, rushing through the southern lowlands and branching off into tiny canals that fuel agriculture in rural communities.

The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.

Pfizer said that the vaccine, made with German partner BioNTech, had an efficacy rate higher than 90% at seven days after the second dose, which means protection is achieved 28 days after a person begins vaccination. The vaccine requires two doses. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it would expect at least 50% efficacy from any coronavirus vaccine.

In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Monday morning, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla called the Covid-19 vaccine ""the greatest medical advance"" in the world's last hundred years.

""Emotions are very high. You can imagine how I felt when I heard the results yesterday at 2 p.m. I think that likely, based on impact, this will be the greatest medical advance in the last 100 years,"" Bourla said.

""It is extraordinary but it's coming at a time that the world needs it the most,"" Bourla said, noting that the United States has recently seen more than 100,000 daily new Covid-19 cases.

In a news release, the pharmaceutical giant said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months after getting their second dose of vaccine, as requested by the FDA

Pfizer said it anticipated reaching that marker by the third week of November.

In a text message to CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci called Pfizer's results ""Extraordinarily good news!""

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he has not seen the vaccine data himself, but he spoke to Bourla Sunday night.

More results to come

There's still more to learn about the Pfizer vaccine.

The Phase 3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine has enrolled 43,538 participants since July 27. As of Sunday, 38,955 of the volunteers have received a second dose of the vaccine. The company says 42% of international trial sites and 30% of US trial sites involve volunteers of racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.

The final goal of the trial is to reach 164 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection.

The Pfizer vaccine uses a never-before-approved technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to produce an immune response in people who are vaccinated.

The mRNA vaccine approach uses genetic material called mRNA to trick cells into producing bits of protein that look like pieces of the virus. The immune system learns to recognize and attack those bits and, in theory, would react fast to any actual infection.

Pfizer said Monday it will evaluate whether the vaccines protects people against severe Covid-19 disease and whether the vaccine can provide long-term protection against Covid-19 disease, even in patients who have been infected before.

""How long this protection lasts is something we don't know,"" Bourla told CNN.

It's not clear whether the Covid-19 vaccine will become a yearly or season shot, but Bourla believes it's likely.

""I think it is a likely scenario that you will need periodical vaccinations,"" Bourla told Gupta. ""The reason why we selected the RNA technology was exactly that. This is a technology that you can boost without problems of creating antibodies against your vaccine, again and again and again.""

So far, the vaccine hasn't shown any safety concerns, Bourla said.

""What we know right now -- it is with very, very high level of confidence these are very highly effective vaccines. What we know so far, it means that we don't have any safety concerns, but we need to wait until the results are there,"" Bourla said.

More than a billion doses expected in 2021

Bourla told CNN that Pfizer expects to have 50 million vaccine doses globally this year, and 1.3 billion next year.

""Who will get this vaccine? We have two separate manufacturing lines. One is in the US,"" Bourla said. ""Those we prefer using mainly for Americans.""

Bourla added that a second line in Europe will be used to produce vaccines for the rest of the world. ""We have already signed contracts with multiple governments in the world and they have placed orders,"" Bourla said.

The vaccine will be free to all American citizens, Bourla said.

Pfizer's vaccine was not developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, the US government's coronavirus vaccine effort.

The federal government has invested $1.95 billion in Pfizer's vaccine to help it manufacture a billion doses or more by next year, but it is not helping to test it and Pfizer has said it will distribute the vaccine itself.

President-elect Joe Biden said in a statement the Pfizer announcement is ""excellent news,"" but warned that mask wearing and social distancing are still necessary.

President Donald Trump, who had previously suggested a vaccine might come before Election Day, said in a tweet that the Pfizer announcement was ""SUCH GREAT NEWS!"" and noted the stock market was up.

When asked on Monday about the timing of the Pfizer announcement -- just days after the election -- Bourla said, ""the science brought it exactly at this time.""

""We announced it the moment we learned about it, and I said multiple times the election for us is an artificial timeline,"" Bourla said. ""This is when science brought it to us."""
222,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/health/coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-data-meaning/index.html,"Pfizer coronavirus vaccine news bodes well for other coronavirus vaccines, experts say","(CNN) News that Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine strongly protects people against infection is good news for other vaccines being developed against the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday.

Pfizer said its candidate vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing infection in volunteers. It uses a never-before-approved technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to produce an immune response in people who are vaccinated.

""This shows that the mRNA platform actually does work. And there's another vaccine candidate, Moderna, that's using the same platform,"" Fauci told CNN in a telephone interview.

Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is working with Moderna and other companies to test their experimental vaccines.

The US federal government has invested $1.95 billion in Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine but is not directly working to help its development.

The mRNA vaccine approach uses genetic material called mRNA to trick cells into producing bits of protein that look like pieces of the virus. The immune system learns to recognize and attack those bits and, in theory, would react fast to any actual infection.

""Really encouraged to see this exciting announcement. Assuming it's supported by the data then this not only represents a potential breakthrough for Pfizer/BioNTech, but also for vaccines in general,"" vaccine expert Robin Shattock, whose team at Imperial College London is working on an mRNA vaccine against coronavirus, said in a statement.

""It also demonstrates the speed and utility of RNA vaccines technology,"" Shattock added.

""This announcement certainly gives a boost to our own self-amplifying RNA vaccine program. Not yet the end game, but hopefully the beginning of global efforts to control this pandemic. A significant light at the end of the tunnel.""

There's a second reason the Pfizer results are good news for other vaccines. They show that using spike protein as a target was the right call, Fauci said.

""The other good thing about it is that an actual immune response to the spike protein is a protective response,"" Fauci said.

The virus has a structure called the spike protein to grapple the cells it attacks. The mRNA vaccines make the body produce little copies of just that structure.

""Remember -- people were not sure that if you made an immune response against the spike protein that that's the best and most appropriate target for an actual vaccine,"" Fauci added.

Targeting the spike

""The good news is that this is the spike protein target and virtually every one of the other vaccines that are being tested also use the spike protein as a target, whether it's expressed in mRNA or it's a soluble protein. The spike protein is used in all of them, which bodes well for all the other vaccines.""

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI also said the findings were a good sign for other vaccines in the pipeline. ""We believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other Covid-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio,"" CEPI CEO Dr. Richard Hatchett said in a statement.

Four coronavirus vaccines are in advanced, Phase 3 trials in the US now. They are made by Pfizer, as well as Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. Plus Maryland-based Novavax is expected to start a US-based Phase 3 trial later this month. It has a trial underway in Britain.

Pfizer got such a quick indication that its coronavirus vaccine is highly protective against infection in part because the pandemic is so bad, Fauci said.

The data was revealed as part of what's called an interim analysis. These are pre-planned peeks at the data.

In this case, Pfizer had planned to have a look as soon as 62 people in its 44,000 volunteer trial developed Covid-19 infections. But before the company could even finish discussing its plans with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it said, 94 people had become infected within a week of getting their second dose of either vaccine or placebo.

Pfizer's Data and Safety Monitoring Board -- an outside team of experts who watch the trial with a neutral eye -- unblinded the data and saw that more than 90% of those cases were in people who had gotten placebo, or dummy shots.

That's a reflection of both the large size of Pfizer's trial and the rate of infection across the United States, which just passed its 10 millionth diagnosed case, Fauci said.

""An answer depends on the size of the trial and how many infections there are in the community,"" he said. It's not clear if all the cases used by Pfizer for its interim analysis were in the United States. The company is also testing the vaccine in Brazil, South Africa, Japan and other countries.

""This was a trial that was geared to 44,000 people and we are in the middle of a major surge right now. Those two things together make it much more likely that you'll get an answer quickly, which is what happened -- we got an answer quickly,"" Fauci added.

Fauci said he expects Pfizer to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization within about a week and a half. That will make it two months since volunteers got their second doses of vaccine. The FDA has asked vaccine makers for two months of safety data before they apply for authorization."
223,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/health/lilly-coronavirus-monoclonal-fda-eua/index.html,FDA okays Lilly's antibody treatment for Covid-19,"(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration said Monday it had issued an emergency use authorization for Eli Lilly and Co's monoclonal antibody therapy to treat mild to moderate coronavirus infections in adults and children.

The single antibody treatment, called bamlanivimab, must be infused in a hospital or other health care setting. It is the first monoclonal antibody to be authorized for use in treating coronavirus. The idea is to kick-start an immune response against infection.

""Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses. Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus' attachment and entry into human cells,"" the FDA said in a statement.

""The FDA's emergency authorization of bamlanivimab provides health care professionals on the frontline of this pandemic with another potential tool in treating Covid-19 patients,"" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in the statement. ""We will continue to evaluate new data on the safety and efficacy of bamlanivimab as they become available.""

FDA authorization was based on a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October. It found the treatment seemed to lower the risk of hospitalization and ease some symptoms in a small number of patients with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19.

The Phase 2 trial involved 452 patients, some who received the treatment and some who got a placebo, which does nothing. Only 1.6% of patients given the treatment had symptoms progress enough that they had to be hospitalized or seek care at the emergency room. For patients who got the placebo, the rate of hospitalization was 6.3%.

Lilly announced it had struck a $375 million deal with the government for 300,000 vials of the antibody treatment, pending EUA, to be delivered in the two months after. Lilly applied for EUA in October. The company said it planned to have 100,000 doses ready to ship within days and would manufacture a million doses by the end of 2020. The treatment would be provided to patients at no cost.

""Lilly will begin shipping bamlanivimab immediately to AmerisourceBergen, a national distributor, which will distribute it as directed by the U.S. government's allocation program,"" the company said in a statement.

Emergency authorization is quicker than full approval

""The issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval,"" the FDA noted.

""Based on the FDA's review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency determined that it is reasonable to believe that bamlanivimab may be effective in treating non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate Covid-19,"" the FDA said.

""And, when used to treat Covid-19 for the authorized population, the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for the drug. There are no adequate, approved and available alternative treatments to bamlanivimab for the authorized population.""

The treatment should be given as soon as possible after a positive Covid-19 test result, within 10 days of the onset of symptoms, the FDA said. It can only be given in a health care setting where doctors also have access to medication in case the patient has a bad reaction to the infusion. Providers who use the treatment also need to let the FDA know if there are any serious adverse events, according to the EUA.

The treatment is not authorized for patients who are hospitalized or require oxygen therapy, as it does not seem to help them.

For months, hope has been building around monoclonal antibody therapies as a potential treatment for Covid-19.

As soon as the pandemic hit the US in January, Lilly's scientists went to work to identify an antibody, one of the proteins the body makes to naturally fight infection, that would best protect against the novel coronavirus.

Scientists sifted through thousands of antibodies generated by a patient who had recovered from Covid-19. They found, selected and then copied those they thought would best neutralize the virus and chose one for a cutting-edge treatment that went into human clinical trials in June.

Regeneron has also applied for an emergency use authorization for its antibody therapy. That's the one given to President Trump last month when he caught coronavirus.

There are 79 antibody therapies under investigation.

""Authorization of this new Eli Lilly antibody treatment is a significant step forward in treating patients and bridging us to the rollout of safe and effective vaccines, with all of these efforts made possible by Operation Warp Speed,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.

""Operation Warp Speed is helping to ensure that therapeutics like Lilly's can reach patients without a day wasted."""

225,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/health/biden-pandemic-plan/index.html,How Biden plans to change the US pandemic response,"(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris say they will move the US Covid-19 pandemic response in a dramatically different direction.

""The pandemic is getting significantly more worrisome all across the country,"" Biden said on Friday. ""I want everyone to know on day one, we're going to put our plan to control this virus into action.""

There were dauntingly high new case numbers last week, and by the time Biden takes office January 20, the influential University of Washington Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation model projects there will be more than 372,000 Covid-19 deaths -- that's 135,000 more than the current total

""By the time that the Biden-Harris administration takes over, this virus is going to have already run rampant through the communities across the United States,"" Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University, said Sunday on CNN.

While President Donald Trump's administration touted the end of the pandemic as one of its accomplishments , Biden has laid out a pandemic plan on his campaign website and it's now echoed on the Biden-Harris transition website published Sunday.

Biden's transition team on Monday announced members of his coronavirus advisory board , which will be led by former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. David Kessler and Yale University's Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith. Other members are Dr. Luciana Borio, Rick Bright, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Atul Gawande, Dr. Celine Gounder, Dr. Julie Morita, Michael Osterholm, Loyce Pace, Dr. Robert Rodriguez and Dr. Eric Goosby.

That doesn't mean Trump's White House coronavirus task force will be turning off the lights.

Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said Sunday on CNN that it's critically important that Trump and Biden's respective coronavirus task force teams work together.

""First and foremost, I think we should demand that there be cooperation,"" Jha said.

Here are five ways Biden says the US coronavirus response will change when he's President.

Increased testing and contact tracing

Number one on Biden's list of promises is more testing and contact tracing.

but Testing has ramped up dramatically since the earliest days of the pandemic,but scientists say the nation needs tens of millions of tests per day to keep the country open safely, and even 10 months into the pandemic, there still aren't enough.

Without testing, scientists can't get a clear picture of where the virus is taking off. With as many as 40% of Covid-19 cases estimated to be asymptomatic, a quick test result is key to stopping the spread of the disease. And research has found about 75% of infected contacts need to be quarantined to stop the spread.

Biden promises all Americans will have access to ""regular, reliable, and free testing.""

They say they'll double drive-through testing sites, invest in new technology, and create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps that would mobilize ""at least 100,000"" culturally competent contact tracers.

Biden says he would also borrow a page from the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and create something akin the War Production Board , which helped supervise the conversion of peacetime factories to plants that made military equipment and weapons. A Pandemic Testing Board, Biden says, would help produce and distribute tens of millions of tests.

Additional investment in vaccines and treatments





States filed their vaccine distribution plans with the CDC weeks ago. But they have received Since March, the Trump administration has spent billions to develop and scale up Covid-19 vaccines and treatments through Operation Warp Speed. Its goal is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines by January 2021. Several potential vaccines are in large-scale trials.States filed their vaccine distribution plans with the CDC weeks ago. But they have received no funds from Congress to start building the infrastructure they will need to distribute those vaccines to tens of millions of people.

Biden promises to invest $25 billion more to make and distribute vaccines to everyone in the US for free.

They say politics will play no role in whether a vaccine is approved, and the new administration will make clinical data for any approved vaccine publicly available.

The Biden campaign also promised therapies and drugs would be affordable.

Mandatory masks and more PPE

Biden has said he'd work with local governors and mayors to mandate masks in public. An October modeling study showed that if 95% of Americans wore masks, more than 100,000 lives could be saved from Covid-19.

The Biden team also says it will take on problems with personal protective equipment for health care workers.

While the Trump administration has claimed to use the Defense Production Act to step up production of PPE, a nonpartisan analysis in September found it has rarely done so

Biden said he would use that power to make sure the national supply stocks are fully replenished. He also promised to help create American-sourced products so the US would not be dependent on other countries.

In addition to encouraging Congress to pass an emergency package to help schools pay for pandemic supplies, the Biden administration would create a ""restart package"" to help small businesses pay for protective equipment and plexiglass.

A push for 'clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance'

The Biden administration also says it would encourage the CDC to take a more active role in providing specific guidance to communities about when they need to shut down. Trump critics say the agency has been sidelined in favor of reopening the economy.

The Biden team says it would create a Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard so people could gauge for themselves, in real time, how much disease is in their ZIP code. That level of data has been hard to find.

Biden would also create a Covid-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force that would become a permanent Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force after the pandemic that would address problems with disparities in the public health system. Black, Hispanic and American Indian communities have had significantly higher rates of infection and hospitalization.

Rejoining WHO and searching for future threats

The Trump administration formally began the process of withdrawing from the World Health Organization in July. Biden says he would re-establish the US relationship with WHO.

The Biden administration also says it plans to expand the CDC's ranks oversees, so that its disease detectives can spot future threats. The Trump administration had cut some of those jobs, including in the China office.

227,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/europe/europe-terror-wave-intl/index.html,Europe terror: Police can shut down attacks quickly. But it's still unable to prevent them,"London (CNN) As the horrors of Vienna unfurled, the timing and abhorrent methodology was familiar -- indiscriminate lethal violence against the undefended, the night before Austria's lockdown set in, and on the eve of the US presidential elections.

Yet, after six years of ISIS-inspired mindless murder, last week's attack , in which four people were killed, perhaps stood out less in its brutality, but instead in the woefully irresponsible noise and video on social media that came with it.

CCTV footage of an innocent man being shot on two occasions, posted unedited, with complete disregard for the victim's family. Similar video of a policeman being shot. Incorrect reports of multiple attackers, and a hostage situation in a Japanese restaurant that never happened. It was disgusting and dangerous in an ongoing incident, especially after police begged Twitter users to stop sharing pictures.

Yet this is where Europe now is with terror in 2020 -- almost a routine, deplorable part of our urban landscape. Vile, disturbing, crippling to victims and their relatives; but part of modern life, in a polarized world where extremism is fueled purely online and lone, disturbed young men are imbalanced enough to seek recognition in the unthinkable. This recent spate of attacks spanned three different variations of today's individual attacker, each embodying a wider challenge that has no immediate solution.

Challenge for intelligence services

Vienna's attacker had been briefly jailed for trying to join ISIS, and was one of a number of radicals released early in Europe from their sentences as legal and security systems fumble with proportionality when dealing with extremists.

Fejzulai Kujtim was sentenced to 22 months in prison on April 25, 2019 for attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told state news agency APA. On December 5, he was released early on parole, it reports.

This young Austrian-born man, of North Macedonian descent, would have been 14 when ISIS declared their caliphate. The terror group was rather the stuff of his teenage fantasies, rather than something physical he could have joined aged 16. Yet still probable online conversion led him to arrest, and even on release, he betrayed his likely intentions, which confirm the challenge of scale and assessment facing intelligence services now.

The timing and abhorrent methodology were familiar, with the shooting coming the night before Austria's lockdown and on the eve of the US presidential elections.

Slovakian security officials warned their Austrian counterparts that the attacker had tried to buy ammunition in the neighboring country the July before, but, the Austrian interior minister said, a communication failure meant Austria clearly failed to act.

The sheer volume of radicals -- who could in 24 hours turn from a sedentary ISIS internet fanboy into a hire-car driver mounting the kerb with a machete -- is an insurmountable manpower drain. The new head of the UK's MI5 security service, Ken McCallum, warned last month that the adherents to ISIS ideology number in the tens of thousands, and they must find the few ""who at any given moment might be mobilizing towards attacks. Having someone 'on our radar' is not,"" he warned, ""the same as having them under detailed real-time scrutiny.""

Attacks like the one perpetrated in Vienna, by a man who had been briefly jailed for trying to join ISIS, have become a deplorable part of the urban landscape.

Yet sometimes it is Europe's own freedoms that enable the threat. The Nice attack last month was perpetrated by a more far-reaching form of dedication, a 21-year-old man who traveled into the city just the night before.

His journey began in September in his native Tunisia -- the home of most of ISIS's foreign fighters in the days when it had a caliphate -- and crossed from Lampedusa, through Europe's open borders, to the Nice basilica where, over 28 minutes, he ended the lives of three church-goers with a knife.

Prosecutors said they found on him only a foot-long blade, a Quran, and two mobile phones. Two spare knives were next to his bag. He had not been deported from Italy after finishing quarantine as he did not have a criminal record, so he traveled on. The freedom to move, to buy knives and phones, and generous asylum laws all meant his sick plot came to fruition.

Diverse threats

And finally, the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, 47, in Paris was, it seems, created in the crucible of local stresses, fueled by anger at a class being shown cartoons that insulted the attacker's religion.

It fed into a political debate that increasingly singles out Islamic mores as incompatible with French secular values, and even provoked prominent figures in Malaysia and Turkey to dump some inflammatory rhetoric onto the flames. And in the end, it was carried out by an 18-year-old Russian refugee of Chechen origin -- who would have been 12 when ISIS declared a caliphate -- and allegedly paid even younger pupils to point out the target.

People gather on Place de la Republique in Paris, France on October 18, to pay homage to history teacher Samuel Paty two days after he was beheaded.

While the background noise and anti-French rhetoric fueled by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former Malaysia PM Mahathir Mohamad can only further addle the febrile emotions of an imbalanced youth, it's not reasonable to determine cause and effect here. The internet, a wired interpretation of religion, boredom and mental health are a far more potent mix in a man who months earlier was legally a child. The ongoing fury and prejudice about France's assimilation of its Muslim population would have swirled around his formative years, but his age limits how considered his motives were. How can you single out which angry young man with an internet connection and a knife is capable of terrorism?

The past month, rather than coalescing into a pattern that helpfully illuminates what ISIS's remnants mean now for Europe, instead just shows how diverse and mutable the current threat is. A European intelligence official told CNN the three recent attacks did not appear to be connected at this time, but that only the full investigations would ascertain that definitively, and whether they indicated a small resurgence by ISIS.

""They were quite sporadic and different in methodology,"" the official said. The attacks did prompt the UK to raise its terror alert from Substantial to Severe, but the official said that was ""more of a temperature change than a gear shift,"" and there were no UK links to the Austria perpetrator.

The spate of attacks including the latest in Vienna, pictured, show how mutable the current threat in Europe really is.

ISIS had specialized, said the official, in promoting a ""cheap and easy, almost 'DIY' approach to attacks,"" seen across Europe in the past three years. ""They actively put ideas and techniques on the internet, providing an intellectual legacy that is likely to endure in all corners of the internet.""

Fighting that virtual virus, rather than dismantling the physical caliphate, is the enduring challenge.

Yet the extremists are not alone in adapting. Europe in particular has become disturbingly -- or even perhaps helpfully -- acclimatized to terror attacks. The attacks in France in 2015 against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and Bataclan theater were large-scale atrocities that captivated terrified citizens for weeks.

Now the attacks are smaller, kill fewer, and are swiftly absorbed in a familiar pattern of response from the authorities. Police reaction times have massively improved, often ending the attack in minutes, and accustomed news cycles digest the horror of it all relatively quickly. Investigators often lay out many of the answers quite quickly, and the capacity for us to be terrified by the power of the yet-to-be-known dissipates.

As we debate or slowly tighten controls on radicals, social media, borders and speech, it is perhaps the best we can do."
228,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/cell-phone-calls-airplanes/index.html,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Most passengers don't want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology. Shutterstock

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

This means you may not be able to join that upcoming work call from 35,000 feet over the Mississippi Delta."
229,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/starlux-airlines-taiwan/index.html,"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market.

And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir.

Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang.

But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.

This Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.

Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will.

A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

But being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members.

A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines.

""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""

Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan.

The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.

But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

""He doesn't think that he is 'Hamlet',"" K.W. Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. ""This has nothing to do with revenge.""

""Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.""

CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.

Whether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.

The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, ""both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,"" says Nieh.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.

Chang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.

""The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,"" adds Nieh.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes.

Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system.

Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.

Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven. The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.

No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitors

Aspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.

At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors.

""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.

""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.""

According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX.

""Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,"" says Law.

""That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.""

But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.

""From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,"" says Law.

Potential cut-throat competition

Taiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years.

Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.

But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?

""A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,"" says Law.

""Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity.

""Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.""

One of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore?

""I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,"" says Law.

""It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,"" says Law.

Nieh, on the other hand, is confident.

""The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours"" he says.

""Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.""

Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers.

""Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,"" says Nieh. ""We're very certain about this part.""

The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.

""Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,"" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.

""All 188 seats on each of the three flights.

""We're very happy about it. We had our expectations but the response has been better than what we expected,"" says Liu.

Grabbing a slice of the market isn't STARLUX's only worry.

Construction delays at the third terminal of Taoyuan Airport have forced the airline to build its check-in counters, airport office, maintenance hangar and apron spaces with very limited resources, says Nieh."
230,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/metro-cityring-copenhagen-denmark/index.html,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest."
231,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/mystery-hotel-budapest/index.html,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet ""floating"" above the reception desk.

This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.

Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.

Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" where the ""girl"" has an iPhone in her hand, or a ""party girl"" interpretation of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.

And if you happen to book visit the ""secret"" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).

Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.

It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as ""The Da Vinci Code.""

While it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.

This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.

""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel. ""Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.

""Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital.

""When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.""

Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.

""First impressions are everything,"" says Berényi. ""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first.

""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""

One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.

Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.

Freemasonry past

The grand staircase is among the elements preserved from the old building. Courtesy Mystery Hotel Budapest

One of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.

After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital.

It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.

Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.

""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.

""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""

Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.

Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.

At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.

Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.

You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.

Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.

Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.

However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.

""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.

Unique suites

There are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.

The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains.

Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel.

""The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,"" explains Varró.

""When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.""

The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&Gabbana hiring it for private events.

Impressive spa

While the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.

There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.

However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.

Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.

Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.

The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.

""This was an empty place,"" says Varró. ""I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.""

Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.

""We don't have thermal waters here, but we do have this,"" says Berényi. ""This Jacuzzi is very popular on Instagram."""

233,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fine-dining-budapest/index.html,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Culinary movement

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.

""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'"
234,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fairmont-baku-flame-towers-azerbaijan/index.html,Flame Towers: Luxury atop one of the world's tallest hotels,"Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — From traditional souks, mosques and UNESCO World Heritage sites, to futuristic skyscrapers, Baku, capital of Azerbaijan , offers an eclectic mix of old and new.

Among the most startling additions to the modern skyline are the Flame Towers, a trio of sky-high structures that resemble tongues of fire reaching high over the Caspian Sea.

Designed by US architecture firm HOK, and with Tower 1 standing at 182 meters, they're the tallest buildings in Azerbaijan.

And visitors can stay in them -- one building's residential, one is for office use, while the third, the 165-meter-tall Fairmont Baku, is a contemporary five-star hotel.

Enter the flame

The towers can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, but night is when they truly come alive. Orange, red and pink LED lights dance across the towers like burning flames.

For some in Baku, they're now a symbol of home.

""You can see Flame Towers as you fly into the airport, lit up with multicolored lights and shining the way,"" fashion designer and media professional Nina Zandnia tells CNN Travel. ""They're the sign that lets everybody know they've reached Azerbaijan.""

So what's it like to stay in one of the country's most familiar landmarks? It's certainly no ordinary hotel.

The bold, sometimes bombastic statements begin with the dramatic exterior and keep going all the way inside.

The venue's seven-story lobby is dominated by an extravagant chandelier, using five kilometers of strands, decorated with 840 lights and more than 600,000 crystal beads, and weighing a whopping two metric tons.

Taking pride of place below is a limited edition black and red Fazioli, one of the most expensive pianos in the world. The M Liminal , designed by NYT Line and Philippe Gendre, was purportedly accompanied Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimov in the performance that took Azerbaijan to victory in the 2011 edition of the annual Eurovision song contest.

Guests shouldn't expect to hear it used in any casual jam sessions, it's now only played by top pianists on special occasions.

Sea views

The tower is home to more than 300 rooms, suites and serviced apartments, that range in price from $170 to upwards of $5,000 a night.

Even the most basic offer ceiling-to-floor windows and sumptuously large double beds. The décor is a contemporary luxury mix, with plush carpets and modern furniture. Spacious and comfortable, each room in the hotel either looks out over the city or across the bay into the sea.

Crisp and glamorous as it is, it does have an edge of corporate blandness that falls short of the regal vibes felt, for example, in the nearby Four Seasons.

A typical one-bedroom suite on the 17th floor offers views of the Caspian Sea and, if eligible, access to the Fairmont Gold lounge on the 19th floor, which comes with a private check-in area and concierge service.

The super-fast elevator to the 17th opens onto a spectacular landing with views across the bay. Once inside the suite, there's a lobby area, are more jaw-dropping views, an office-slash-dining room, with wooden desk and a four-seater dining table.

Then there's a generous, richly carpeted lounge with an oversized sofa and jazzy signature chair. The separate bedroom has a huge king-sized bed. There's an enormous walk-in closet stacked with hangers, drawers and laundry essentials that leads into a large bathroom complete with bath and shower room.

In both of the suite's two bathrooms, there are bespoke toiletries -- yes, your name is printed on the shampoo, moisturizer and conditioner bottle. It's a souvenir just asking to be taken home.

The royal suite

Nice touches, but does the hotel have celeb appeal? Yes, says, Zumrud Ismayilova, the hotel's PR and marketing manager. Names are not named, but the list apparently includes leaders, royals and celebrities.

""We have had many VIP guests stay at the hotel, but we would never disclose who they are,"" she tells CNN Travel. ""When our guests come to stay with us, they expect privacy and confidentiality and that is exactly what we give them.""

Positioned at the very tip of the flame, the Royal Suite offers panoramic views of both city and sea. There are two bedrooms, both with en suite bathrooms, a lounge, private dining room, study, a guest bathroom, a kitchen and a grand hallway with chandelier -- 375 square meters (4,036 square feet) of living space in total.

""The VIP or family will stay in the suite, but the rest of their party tends to take over the entire floor. We have additional rooms for security and staff, and a suite for extra family members,"" explains Ismayilova.

There's an open-plan living area, private study, a dining room fit for for 12 or more guests and a fully equipped kitchen (for the servants, of course). But the main attraction is the grand en suite bathroom with a vast oyster-shaped bath complete with window view over the bay.

Wellness

The hotels amenities are a mixed bag. There's an elegant spa spread over two floors of the hotel with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, hammam and spaces to unwind. There's also a fully equipped gym.

The beautifully designed Sky Garden allows guests the luxury of relaxing on the sundeck or taking advantage of the poolside sauna while looking out at the sea. There's an S-shaped rooftop pool and outdoor bar, which look better from a distance than close up.

It's best visited come evening. When the sun's up, the towers reflect the sun and magnify its heat, making this area a frying pan.

Food and entertainment

As you'd hope from a fancy hotel inside one of the country's biggest landmarks, the main Le Bistro restaurant offers an array of local Azerbaijani wines and delicacies. The Balcon café offers specialty teas and cakes, as well as sushi in the afternoons.

There's also the Nur lounge which is a funky setting serving cocktails and snacks, and is a good pre-drinks site to soak in the atmosphere before moving onto the hotel's Jazz Club, a local institution.

""We always recommend people to check out the Jazz Club after 9 p.m., because that's when it really gets going. It's very popular with both the hotel guests and the locals, and we always offer something new to keep people entertained,"" Ismayilova says.

There are two things that most hotels are unable to provide -- a shopping mall and cinema. Fairmont Flame Towers offers both.

Park Cinema provides guests (and members of the public) with six screens, including IMAX, showing the latest Arabic, English and Russian language films.

Next door is the Flame Towers Shopping Mall, due for completion in early 2020. Luxury brands, high street names, cafes and restaurants are all set to take up residency."
235,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/long-life-lerik-azerbaijan-wellness/index.html,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.

There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan

The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.

In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.

The Museum of Longevity

The two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants.

It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.

And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.

Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.

The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.

However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.

Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.

Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.

The tale of the 168-year-old man

Is this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva

Lerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.

The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.

Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.

Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.

Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""

This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.

'Stillness of the mind'

When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).

Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO.

She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15.""

""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""

Good nutrition and natural remedies

Halima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva

Qambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.

She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.

Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.

Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.

It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.

""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication.

Generations living side by side

Beyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.

Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.

At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.

Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.

'Whatever God gives'

Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva

""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says.

In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.

Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.

Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.

The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.

2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer

The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough."
236,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/yanar-dag-azerbaijan-land-of-fire/index.html,Eternal flame: How Azerbaijan became the 'Land of Fire',"Editor's Note — Editor's Note — CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.

(CNN) — ""This fire has burned 4,000 years and never stopped,"" says Aliyeva Rahila. ""Even the rain coming here, snow, wind -- it never stops burning.""

Ahead, tall flames dance restlessly across a 10-meter stretch of hillside, making a hot day even hotter.

This is Yanar Dag -- meaning ""burning mountainside"" -- on Azerbaijan 's Absheron Peninsula, where Rahila works as a tour guide.

A side effect of the country's plentiful natural gas reserves, which sometimes leak to the surface, Yanar Dag is one of several spontaneously occurring fires to have fascinated and frightened travelers to Azerbaijan over the millennia.

Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the mysterious phenomena when he passed through the country in the 13th century. Other Silk Road merchants brought news of the flames as they would trave l to other lands.

It's why the country earned the moniker the ""land of fire.""

Ancient religion

Such fires were once plentiful in Azerbaijan, but because they led to a reduction of gas pressure underground, interfering with commercial gas extraction, most have been snuffed out.

Yanar Dag is one of the few remaining examples, and perhaps the most impressive.

At one time they played a key role in the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which was founded in Iran and flourished in Azerbaijan in the first millennium BCE.

l e v a r t

For Zoroastrians, fire is a link between humans and the supernatural world, and a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom can be gained. It's purifying, life-sustaining and a vital part of worship.

Today, most visitors who arrive at the no-frills Yanar Dag visitors' center come for the spectacle rather than religious fulfillment.

The experience is most impressive at night, or in winter. When snow falls, the flakes dissolve in the air without ever touching the ground, says Rahila.

Despite the claimed antiquity of the Yanar Dag flames -- some argue that this particular fire may only have been ignited in the 1950s -- it's a long 30-minute drive north from the center of Baku just to see it. The center offers only a small cafe and there's not much else in the area.

Ateshgah Fire Temple

For a deeper insight into Azerbaijan's history of fire worship, visitors should head east of Baku to Ateshgah Fire Temple.

""Since ancient times, they think that [their] god is here,"" says our guide, as we enter the pentagonal complex which was built in the 17th and 18th century by Indian settlers in Baku.

Fire rituals at this site date back to the 10th century or earlier. The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for ""home of fire"" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.

A natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.

The temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.

Merchants and ascetics

Built like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.

These were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.

The temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold."
237,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/entertainment/industry-review/index.html,'Industry' sees the Darwinian world of high finance through its new recruits,"(CNN) ""Industry"" is essentially a mashup of earlier TV shows and movies, but in the most enjoyable of ways. Focusing on young candidates at a major London financial firm, the formula weds ""Billions"" to ""The Paper Chase,"" with an appealing cast caught up in a Darwinian struggle for (professional) survival.

""People are our capital,"" the new arrivals are told as part of their orientation at Pierpoint & Co., along with warnings that ""Half of you won't be here in six months,"" and if the objective is to stick around, ""Just make yourselves indispensable.""

Yet as is traditionally true in the world of high finance -- and especially dramatic presentations of it -- the perks and trappings associated with success must be won by enduring what amounts to fraternity hazing, just in finer attire. They're told it's a meritocracy, but the inequities in power with those situated on higher rungs of the corporate ladder linger, despite this seemingly more enlightened age.

The new graduates, meanwhile, do what anyone would under these pressure-packed circumstances -- namely, drink and carouse and use sex (this being HBO, starkly depicted) as a form of aggressive stress relief. Of course, the danger of coercion also rears its head when those situations involve superiors or clients, and even the peer-to-peer encounters come with an element of risk.

The premiere, directed by ""Girls'"" Lena Dunham , nicely sets the tone of this series, which was created by Mickey Down and Konrad Kay. The producers have also done an exceptional job in casting the new faces -- which include Myha'la Herrold as Harper, an American hiding some secrets, and Marisa Abela as Yasmin, who struggles to earn respect from her male superiors, while beginning a coy flirtation with fellow rookie Robert (Harry Lawtey). Ken Leung, as Harper's mentor, and Sarah Parish as a demanding client are among the more familiar co-stars.

""I would implore everybody who's celebrating today to remember, it's good to be a humble winner.

""Remember when I was here four years ago, remember how bad that felt? Remember that half the country right now still feels that way,"" Chappelle said, referring to his first hosting gig on the show in 2016.

He brought up President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis , joking that the President had great coverage in his personal health care plan, which provided him with a ride to the hospital in a helicopter, a team of doctors and experimental medications

Chappelle said Trump's special treatment while he was ill was like taking a bag of burgers to a homeless shelter, eating them in front of the homeless and saying, ""don't let hunger dictate your life,"" mimicking the President's infamous tweet after his recovery, when he told Americans not to fear Covid or let it dominate their lives.

""Where was his secret serum?"" he asked of Cain's treatment.

""That's your leader. Think about that, for four years, that's your leader. What kind of man does that? What kind of man makes sure he's OK, while his friends are fighting for their lives and die?

""A White man. And I don't mean to put this on the Whites, but I've been Black for a long time, I notice the pattern.""

'Kindness conspiracy'

Chappelle said if White people actually want to help Black people, they should participate in his plan he called the ""kindness conspiracy.""

""It's random acts of kindness for Black people. Do something nice for a Black person just because they're Black, and you've got to make sure they don't deserve it.

""It's a very important part of it, they can't deserve it, the same way all these years they did terrible things to Black people just because they're Black and they didn't deserve it.""

He poked fun at neighbors who complained about the noise from the shows he recently did in a corn field in Ohio. Chappelle said he listened in on a town meeting held on the issue over Zoom.

""They said, 'I keep hearing this guy screaming all night, my kids are trying to sleep, and all they hear is (the n-word).' I said, 'Was I saying it, or were you?'""

""He had that twang in his voice, you know, that twang where you hear that accent, like, 'Ohhhhh I know he doesn't wear his mask.'""

""I don't know why poor White people don't like wearing a mask. What is the problem? You wear a mask at the Klan rally -- wear it to Walmart too.""

Chappelle said those who say they don't want to wear a mask because it's ""oppressive"" should try ""wearing the mask I've been wearing all these years.""

""I can't even tell something true unless it has a punchline behind it. You don't know how to survive yourselves -- Black people are the only ones who know how to survive this. Whites, hurry quick, come get your (n-word) lessons. You need us.""

We need 'forgiveness' and 'joy'

He got serious again as he concluded his monologue, talking about the fact that the life expectancy of White people is dropping for the first time in American history due to drugs and suicide.

""All these White people out there that feel that anguish, that pain, they're mad because they think nobody cares -- maybe they don't. Let me tell you something, I know how that feels.""

He said he also knew how police officers feel, when they put on their uniform, that they have a target on their back.

""Believe me, believe me, I know how that feels. Everyone knows how that feels.""

But, he said, many people hate each other for it.

""And I don't hate anybody. I just hate that feeling. That's what I fight, and what I suggest you fight. You gotta find a way to live your life. You gotta find a way to forgive each other. You gotta find a way to find joy in your existence, in spite of that feeling.

""And if you can't do that, come get these (n-word) lessons."""

In a career spanning over 8,200 episodes, the former journalist became a symbol of curiosity and the quest for knowledge. For decades, viewers tuned in five nights a week to watch the familiar face on their screens. His reach is immeasurable -- people learned English from watching the show.

On Sunday morning,""Jeopardy!"" announced that Trebek had died from a years long battle with pancreatic cancer. Just four months earlier, he published his memoir, ""The Answer is...Reflections On My Life.""

In it, he wrote about coming to terms with his diagnosis, his legacy and his understanding of death.

While viewers around the world mourn the figure, here's a look back at his most memorable observations in the memoir.

On ending his career as the host of 'Jeopardy!'

""No matter how I feel before the show, when I get out there it's all forgotten because there's a show to be done. Yet I know there will come a time when I won't be able to answer that bell. I know there will come a time when I can no longer do my job as host -- do it as well as the job demands, as well as I demand. Part of it is physical. Standing on your feet for eleven hours two days in a row is difficult for someone who's about to turn eighty, even without getting worn down by chemotherapy.""

On his battle with pancreatic cancer

""Interestingly, the longer I've lived with the cancer, the more my definition of toughness has changed. I used to think not crying meant you were tough. Now I think crying means you're tough. It means you're strong enough to be honest and vulnerable. It means you're not pretending.""

On accepting his death

""I don't like to use the terms 'battling' or 'fighting' when talking about cancer. It suggests that there are only two outcomes: 'winning""'and 'losing.' That's nonsense. I understand why we human beings choose to see cancer in these terms. It's easier to comprehend and less scary if we see the experience as a boxing match and the disease as an opponent who might be subdued by sheer force of will and determination.""

On death itself

""But when death happens, it happens. Why should I be afraid of it? Now, if it involves physical suffering, I might be afraid of that. But, according to my doctor, that's what hospice is for. They want to make it as easy as it can possibly be for you to transition into whatever future you happen to believe in. Am I a believer? Well, I believe we are all part of the Great Soul -- what some call God. We are God, and God is us.""

On his legacy

""But I suppose if I had to answer I would say I'd like to be remembered first of all as a good and loving husband and father, and also as a decent man who did his best to help people perform at their best. Because that was my job. That is what a host is supposed to do.""

On his last few days

""Yep, I'll be perfectly content if that's how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love, my soul mate, and our two wonderful children nearby. I'll sit there for a while and then maybe the four of us will go for a walk, each day trying to walk a little farther than the last. We'll take things one step at a time, one day at a time. In fact, I think I'll go sit in the swing for a bit right now. The weather is beautiful -- the sun is shining into a mild, mild looking sky and there's not a cloud in sight."""

(CNN) I don't know about you, but I am feeling beyond weary.

The world has felt even more doom-and-gloom this year, and what's missing more than anything is a bit of fun.

Oh -- and, at times, civility, peace and not feeling like the world is imploding.

So, how about we all unplug for a bit?

Don't call it a ""guilty pleasure,"" because you have zero to feel guilty about.

Instead, let's call it what it is: feel-good content you can stream in the safety of your own home. For your consideration ...

Zachary Levi (right) stars as Billy Batson, an abandoned teen turned superhero, in ""Shazam!""

""Shazam!"": Zachary Levi won hearts years ago starring in the NBC series ""Chuck."" In his latest role, he's practically perfect as a superhero.

The best thing about this fun film is you don't have to be a comic book geek to enjoy it.

""Shazam!"" is now streaming on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN's parent company).

Reese Witherspoon, in character as Elle Woods, carries canine actor Moonie, a.k.a. Bruiser Woods, in a scene from ""Legally Blonde.""

""Legally Blonde"": Elle Woods is such a delicious treat.

Reese Witherspoon was so great in this comedy about a sorority girl who heads off to Harvard Law School that the 2001 film spurred movie sequels, a Broadway musical and a reality show.

The original film, based on a novel of the same title by Amanda Brown, is currently streaming on several services, including Showtime.

(From left) Cher as Loretta Castorini and Nicolas Cage as Ronny Cammareri co-star in ""Moonstruck."" Cher won an Oscar for best actress in this role.

""Moonstruck"": Snap out of it!

There is a reason why Cher won the Academy Award for best actress in 1988 for her performance in this film. She was a delight starring as Loretta Castorini, a widow who falls for her fiancé's younger and more passionate brother, played by Nicolas Cage.

If you are lucky, Cosmo's moon might show up while you're watching.

In ""Pitch Perfect,"" Anna Kendrick (center) as Beca Mitchell and Rebel Wilson (second from right) as Fat Amy play members of a cappella group The Barden Bellas.

""Pitch Perfect"": I had to include at least one musical on this list.

Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson help lead the cast in this charming film set in the world of a cappella singing competitions.

The film is just sharp enough not to be cheesy and just sweet enough to avoid being overly cloying. Think of it as a cross between ""Glee"" and ""Mean Girls.""

""Pitch Perfect"" can be found on a few services, including Amazon Prime.

Those are just to get you started.

So, give yourself a break and decompress with some make-believe. You deserve it.

For your weekend

Three things to watch:

A new documentary takes a closer look at bestselling singer-songwriter Tiziano Ferro's journey as an international artist.

'Ferro'

Get to know this artist.

Amazon Prime bills this documentary as ""an intense and powerful journey inside the private and professional life of Tiziano Ferro, one of the most famous contemporary Italian singers.""

The doc takes viewers between Italy and the United States to witness Ferro's successes and failures. It's narrated by some of those closest to him who spill tea and share never-before-seen footage.

Ferro starts streaming Friday on Amazon Prime.

Iain Armitage stars as the 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper in the spin-off prequel ""Young Sheldon.""

'Young Sheldon'

Full disclosure: I'm friends with and a huge fan of Danielle Pinnock , who plays Ms. Ingram in this comedy series.

But even if I weren't, I would still love this show. It tells the origin story of Sheldon Cooper, the lovable yet annoying scientist I first fell for on the sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory.""

The spin-off starring Iain Armitage is equally funny. Season four starts streaming Friday on CBS All Access and the Apple TV app.

Hugh Laurie leads as self-serving British politician Peter Laurence in ""Roadkill.""

'Roadkill'

If you aren't watching ""Roadkill"" on PBS, you should be.

I love a good British drama. This one stars Hugh Laurie as a scheming UK government minister trying to navigate a pair of scandals.

My CNN colleague Brian Lowry called it ""one of those classy British miniseries that looks right at home on PBS' Masterpiece, even though it's a contemporary story.""

New episodes of the miniseries air on Sundays through November 22 and are streaming on the PBS app.

Two things to listen to:

Get back on the dance floor with ""Disco,"" Kylie Minogue's new album release.

Of course, Kylie Minogue has a new album coming out titled ""Disco.""

The Princess of Pop has become well known for her dance tunes, and her 15th studio album drops on Friday.

She told Idolator last year , ""I think it's going to be getting back on the dancefloor, like grown-up disco; that's where I want it to be.""

That's where we want to be, too, Kylie.

Keep the dance party going with (from left) Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jesy Nelson, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall of Little Mix.

Likewise, Little Mix's new album, ""Confetti,"" is sure to get you grooving.

Nothing beats a good synth-pop tune or a girl group, and this quartet of British singers is just one of the acts we can thank ""The X Factor"" for making famous.

The group's sixth studio album is out Friday.

One thing to talk about:

The gang is all here: Shown are (from left) Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian West, Rob Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner at Kardashian West's 40th birthday bash.

The Kardashian/Jenner clan keeps reminding us that their lives are nothing like ours.

The famous family has always been a bit of a lightning rod. Reminding us that they can afford to live life like a global pandemic isn't raging probably didn't win them any fans -- even though sister Khloe Kardashian and Kim's husband, Kanye West , both have said they contracted the disease early on.

But that's actually been part of the key to the family's success. They are both aspirational to some and the reality stars you love to hate.

Clearly, it works for them.

Something to sip on

Mariah Carey is already in holiday spirit mode. That's not a bad thing.

No, we still haven't reached the middle of November, but God bless Mariah Carey for giving us permission to already start playing Christmas tunes.

And yes, every year people complain that the holiday season starts earlier and earlier.

Just after Halloween, Carey posted a video on social media that showed a ghoul opening a door to reveal her in holiday pajamas, throwing fake snow.

""It's time!"" she says before the screen reads, ""It's time! (But let's get through Thanksgiving first.)""

Cue me playing Carey's perennial hit, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You.""

Look, as far as I am concerned, we can't get this year over with quickly enough, so go ahead and play the music, drink the hot chocolate and do whatever else helps to give you that warm holiday feeling.

Pop back here next Thursday for all the latest entertainment happenings that matter."

Longoria appeared on MSNBC Sunday talking about the presidential election and how important women and people of color were to President-elect Joe Biden 's victory.

""The women of color showed up in big ways. Of course, you saw in Georgia what Black women have done but Latina women were the real heroines here, beating men in turnout in every state and voting Biden-Harris at an average rate of close to 3 to 1. And that wasn't surprising to us,"" she told MSNBC's Ari Melber

In a tweet posted Sunday night, Longoria offered an apology and clarification saying she was sad to hear her comments were seen by some people as ""taking credit from Black women.""

""When I said that Latinas were heroines in this election, I simply meant that they turned out in greater numbers and voted more progressively than LATINO MEN,"" she tweeted.

The game show and its host, Alex Trebek, have provided some stable enjoyment in the midst of much instability this past year.

Despite being ill, the long-time host continued to work on his hit quiz show and recently enjoyed a rare night in which returning champion Kevin Walsh found himself answering the final question solo after the other two contestants ended up with either a deficit or zero balance.

Here are some other memorable moments from the show:

Clean-shaven Trebek

When Trebek debuted as host of ""Jeopardy!"" in 1984, he sported a healthy mustache.

It became his signature look. Viewers were shocked he shaved it off in 2001, giving him a more youthful appearance.

He went back and forth over the years with mustache and without, before finally settling on a clean-shaven look the past few years.

#AlexTrebeard may be gone ... but he's never more than a few days (without shaving) away. Farewell! pic.twitter.com/vT4WAGlZwT — Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) September 20, 2018

In 2018, Trebek announced on Twitter that his wife ""voted"" for him to go without his facial hair. So that settled it.

Mixing it up with a sister show

For April's Fool Day in 1997, Trebek switched places with ""Wheel of Fortune"" host Pat Sajak.

What followed was... different.

Both games shows -- and their hosts -- have been beloved for years, so viewers rolled with it.

The Ken Jennings streak

There may have never been more excitement surrounding the competition than in 2014, when contestant Ken Jennings won 74 games back to back, the longest streak in ""Jeopardy!"" history.

The software engineer didn't do too shabby in the winnings department either, bringing home $3,370,700.

James Holzhauer, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings competed in ""Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time.""

He snagged the grand prize of $1 million as champion.

Showed him the money

James Holzhauer thrilled viewers in 2019, when he made history setting the record for the largest single-game winnings at $131,127.

He went on to enjoy a 32 consecutive-game winning streak and won one of the ""Tournament of Champions"" specials.

But it's contestant Brad Rutter who is celebrated as one of the biggest money winners ever on the show.

Thanks to his various appearances on the franchise, including a $2.1 million win during one of ""Tournament of Champions,"" Rutter has earned more than $5 million from the show.

Three -way tie

Professor Scott Weiss created a true moment of sportsmanship in 2007. He structured his final wager so that if he and his two fellow contestants would all have $16,000 if everyone answered the final question correctly.

They did and it led to the show's first ever three-way tie not involving zero dollars.

All three returned for the following episode."

The ""SNL"" episode aired the same day as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were projected the winners of the presidential race, and actors Jim Carrey and Maya Rudolph did not miss a beat.

""Thank you very much, America! We did it!"" Carrey's president-elect said, opening the show. ""Can you believe it? I honestly kind of can't. It's been so long since something good happened.""

Carrey's Biden also said he would be a president to all Americans.

250,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/06/entertainment/moonbase-8-review/index.html,'Moonbase 8' is a pretty weightless Showtime comedy,"(CNN) ""Moonbase 8"" is about three guys in what amounts to quarantine, which adds an unexpectedly timely wrinkle to what's otherwise a pretty silly comedy. Even with that, though, this wry but inconsequential Showtime series feels so weightless, despite the talent involved, that it could easily just float away.

Hatched up by the team behind the sketch comedy ""Portlandia,"" the mildly amusing conceit involves a trio of aspiring, mostly inept astronauts auditioning for a spot on a Moon base by sequestering themselves in a mock space installation in Winslow, Arizona. (As a footnote, this is almost surely the most pop-culture attention Winslow has received since the Eagles song ""Take It Easy."")

The astronauts are played by John C. Reilly, Fred Armisen and Tim Heidecker (of ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!""), and they're an eccentric bunch, down the quirky nicknames. Reilly's Cap is clearly the most desperate of the trio thanks to troubles at home, while Heidecker's Rook is a devout Christian struggling with being separated from his wife and horde of children.

Despite the notion that the base seeks to approximate the challenges of being on the Moon -- dusting off the ""urine recycling machine,"" for example, when there's a problem with the water supply -- various people drop in and out over the course of the six episodes. That said, the series remains fairly claustrophobic, and mostly uneventful, despite the occasional foray outside their protective bubble into the desert environs (wearing spacesuits, of course).

The creative team's sketch-comedy roots appear evident in some of the sillier situations, which have the understated tone of a British comedy. Reilly does conjure the occasional funny moment as someone so dense it's hard to imagine him passing a driving test, much less qualifying for the space program and meeting NASA's demands.

254,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/05/entertainment/b-positive-review/index.html,'B Positive' earns mildly passing grades as odd-couple sitcoms go,"(CNN) The latest series from sitcom maestro Chuck Lorre, ""B Positive,"" owes debts to two of his earlier hits: ""Dharma & Greg"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" Yet this conventional sitcom benefits most from its casting, pairing ""Silicon Valley's"" Thomas Middleditch and Annaleigh Ashford as the mismatched duo united by the former's need for a kidney.

That predicament was a personal one to series creator Marco Pennette, a transplant recipient, which explains the origins of a concept that's sort of the opposite of ""meet-cute."" But it's primarily a predictable excuse to throw together an odd couple that wouldn't hang out otherwise -- him a tightly wound, newly divorced therapist, her the boozy, free-spirited ""train wreck"" he remembers from high school.

The two run into each other at a wedding, not long after Middleditch's Drew has learned that he's going to need a transplant. When he explains his plight to former classmate Gina (Ashford, whose credits include ""Masters of Sex""), she impulsively offers to become his donor, after reminding him that he's ""the one guy I didn't hook up with in high school.""

Lorre has almost single-handedly kept the traditional multi-camera sitcom alive (other current CBS shows including "" Mom "" and ""Bob Hearts Abishola ""), and ""B Positive"" should receive a lift from airing behind the producer's ""Big Bang"" spinoff ""Young Sheldon,"" which, despite its popularity, qualifies as one of TV's most unsung comedies.

That bodes reasonably well for ""B Positive"" at least getting sampled, and viewers might be eager for a comedic distraction after days of election drama, which doesn't mean they'll be inclined to stick around.

Somehow, though, Sacha Baron Cohen hasn't lost the power to deliver audacious surprises, with enough explosive, not-suitable-for-anywhere laughs to power through the flatter patches this sort of exercise inevitably yields.

Success hasn't spoiled ""Borat,"" but it has complicated the process of becoming him. Even allowing for the fact that he can't always be the character -- he's a little too recognizable, as the movie illustrates -- the comic-provocateur continues to find unwitting marks. Savvier viewers might wind up wondering about the waivers that allowed these people to be featured on camera or the teams of lawyers involved, but with Cohen, making an omelet requires breaking some eggs.

Setting the logistics aside, Cohen (part of a credited team of eight writers) and director Jason Woliner have managed to concoct a clever premise explaining Borat's belated return to America, on a mission to deliver a gift to Vice President Mike Pence in order to curry favor with the Trump administration and avoid a death sentence in his native Kazakhstan. (Hence the latest unwieldy subtitle, ""Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."")

As fans of the original will remember, the fictionalized version of Kazakhstan isn't a particularly enlightened spot, with such backward attitudes toward women that Borat refers to his daughter as his ""non-male son."" Still, through a series of odd circumstances the teenage Tutar (newcomer Maria Bakalova) comes along for the ride, offering an old-fashioned father-daughter bonding experience as the spine for all the over-the-top shenanigans and exploits.

Sacha Baron Cohen in 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' (Courtesy of Amazon Studios).

The less given away the better, but once again -- in a fashion the star has honed through the years, including his Showtime series ""Who is America?"" -- Cohen fearlessly gets people to participate in absolutely bonkers situations. That can range from having a baker put an anti-Semitic inscription on a cake to consultation with a plastic surgeon to asking a dress-store owner where to find the ""No means yes"" section.

Happily, her guest-star-studded Netflix variety special incorporates her most famous shtick -- satirically lip-synching Trump speeches and interviews -- while adding a few extremely clever sketches and, perhaps inevitably, a couple clunkier bits akin to the last 15 minutes of ""Saturday Night Live.""

The central concept of ""Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine"" casts the comic and writer as the host of a happy-talk morning show by the same title, slowly losing her mind (understandably) as she tries to maintain a perpetual faux smile while a pandemic-plagued world crumbles around her.

That provides the excuse for a mix of news segments (including a Trump call-in, with Cooper portraying him on the golf course), commercial spoofs and bizarre flights of fancy, punctuated by a parade of big-name guests (the best by far being an interlude with Helen Mirren) indicative of how many admirers Cooper has amassed.

Directed by Natasha Lyonne, this exercise in what might be called ""SC-TV"" provides a nifty showcase for Cooper's talents. That said, the hour (OK, 49 minutes) frankly might have been stronger by skipping the detours and adhering more tightly to the news-satire conceit, such as when Cooper discusses the problems faced by zoos before cheerfully adding, ""We'll sugarcoat what happens to all the animals.""

The long list of cameos includes Maya Rudolph (who's also among the producers), Jon Hamm, Ben Stiller, Jane Lynch, Megan Thee Stallion, Marisa Tomei and Winona Ryder, putting its star in very good company. Still, this is clearly Cooper's showcase, with a throwback feel to those old variety shows built around comedic standouts like Richard Pryor, albeit with a bit more thematic adhesive and a more consistently pointed political edge.

The tale of a troubled chess prodigy, Taylor-Joy's magnetic presence is enough reason to watch this handsome Netflix limited series, even if the seven-part production gets dragged out about three episodes too long.

As games go, chess doesn't necessarily lend itself to cinematic exercises, with the 1993 movie ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" among the rare exceptions. Adapting the novel by Walter Tevis, writer-producer-director Scott Frank ( ""Godless"" ) tries to remedy that by having the young Beth Harmon actually envision oversized pieces on the ceiling, a device that's nifty for only a while.

As opening moves go, ""The Queen's Gambit"" (a title that refers to chess, but also Beth's rise in a male-dominated endeavor in the 1950s and '60s) starts very, very slowly, beginning with the girl's struggles at an orphanage, where she meets a kindly janitor (Bill Camp) who introduces her to the game.

Soon enough, she's visiting the local high school, drubbing older members of the chess club, while sneakily popping pills in her spare time -- offering the familiar juxtaposition of genius and chemical abuse.

To her surprise, Beth gets adopted, but the tension between her new parents shows, and pretty soon it's just Beth and her new mom, Alma (Marielle Heller, the director of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" ), who finally agrees to cultivate Beth's gift as much out of necessity as benevolence. The prize money comes in handy, though Alma is a little too inclined to imbibe her share of the profits.

The HBO documentary, however, provides a contextual, nuanced view -- rooted in the controversy over Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez -- while painting a colorful portrait of the ensuing battle, when the Democrats brought the equivalent of a strongly worded letter to a knife fight.

Director Billy Corben knows Florida well, and he niftily sets up the key players in a drama that even the HBO movie ""Recount"" couldn't entirely do justice. Yet he traces that back to the outrage triggered by the story of Gonzalez, whose mother died bringing him to the US, as her family wrestled with his father over the boy's return to Cuba.

Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore split with the Clinton administration over the case, reflecting the importance of Florida in the 2000 race. ""Everyone on both campaigns knew it was coming down to Florida,"" recalls Gore attorney Mitchell Berger.

The Republicans, though, not only had that strongly motivated portion of the Cuban-American community on its side, but once the electoral skirmish began, a team of operatives who engaged in bare-knuckled tactics and sound bemused and completely unapologetic reminiscing about them now.

Indeed, the end-justifies-the-means attitude is summed up by none other than Trump ally Roger Stone , who tells the filmmakers, ""Politics is about winning."" (In the documentary, Stone is accused by Bush campaign operative Brad Blakeman of inflating his role in what transpired, a contention that Stone shrugs off.)

: In this gritty coming-of-age drama, a 14-year-old (played by Jahi Di'Allo Winston) desperately wants to join an infamous group of Baltimore dirt-bike riders who rule the summertime streets. His mom (Teyonah Parris) and his police mentor, Detective Rivers (William Catlett), work overtime to help the charismatic teen reach his full potential, but when the leader of the riders, Blax (Meek Mill), takes the boy under his wing, the lure of revving his own dirt bike skids the teen toward a road way past the straight and narrow."
266,2020-10-08 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/entertainment/connecting-review/index.html,'Connecting...' connects sharp writing with the latest socially distant comedy,"(CNN) ""Connecting..."" is just one of several post-coronavirus shows shot employing a Zoom-style, virtual format, focusing on a group of friends -- diverse even by TV-sitcom standards -- navigating the early days of quarantine measures. Yet it turns out to be smartly written, funny and occasionally touching, capturing the need for connection amid the struggles unique to this period.

Each week begins with the date, opening on ""March 29, 2020"" and jumping to April 15 and May 25 in the subsequent episodes previewed.

At the core of it all is a classic Sam-and-Diane relationship, with the prospect of romance between two of the longtime pals -- something about which the others, naturally, strategize and gossip -- at the worst possible time.

Ben (Preacher Lawson) has just broken up with a girlfriend none of them liked, seemingly leaving the door open for Annie (Otmara Marrero), who has long harbored feelings for him, in a scenario where the two were never previously free and single at the same time. Still, the proposed act of suggesting that they move in together -- given his stated loneliness -- feels like a major leap that she's understandably reluctant to make.

They're surrounded by friends each dealing with the crisis in their own way, as they discuss everything from the silly (""The NBA is not coming back this year!"") to the sobering, which includes hearing from a nurse seeing the virus' impact firsthand as well as the Black Lives Matter movement.

267,2020-09-17 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/entertainment/the-way-i-see-it-review/index.html,'The Way I See It' filters the Obama presidency through Pete Souza's lens,"(CNN) Pete Souza became an unlikely political figure, stepping out from his behind-the-scenes role as official White House photographer and into the spotlight with Instagram posts jabbing President Trump, which became the book ""Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents."" That provides the foundation for a documentary, ""The Way I See It,"" which offers an insider's view of Barack Obama presidency through Souza's unerring lens.

Souza served as a photographer in the Reagan White House before he was approached about chronicling Obama's terms -- a job with its own fascinating background that he approached, Souza says here, as ""a historian with a camera,"" constantly thinking of ""mood, emotion, context.""

For Souza, that spanned the gamut of experiences, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to wrenching moments with families of the children killed at Sandy Hook, from the exultation surrounding the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling to Obama and his daughters happily playing in the snow.

Director Dawn Porter takes those raw images -- which yielded the book ""Obama: An Intimate Portrait"" -- and wrings an additional magic from them by wedding the still photos with video of events, in a way that underscores what the photographer captured, then animates and enhances it. That's especially true with something like his portfolio from Ronald Reagan's funeral, juxtaposing pictures of Nancy Reagan standing over his coffin with footage of her.

Souza's new-found fame, however, stemmed from an unexpected -- and to friends and associates, surprising -- departure once Trump took over, as his growing exasperation prompted him to begin contrasting flattering images of Obama with actions of the Oval Office's current inhabitant. Those shots of Obama, he says, illustrate ""how the job as president should be done.""

The tourist boat had run out of wetsuits, but Ridley jumped in anyway to give his latest ambassador, conservationist and explorer David de Rothschild , a demonstration of his latest project.

Ridley has form when it comes to asking people to perform simple tasks for the environment. In Sydney in 2007, he started Earth Hour -- the global ""lights out"" movement which asked whole cities to turn off non-essential lights for an hour on a designated day -- that has since spread to 188 countries.

Now, he and local scientists are asking people to take photos for the ""Great Reef Census,"" the biggest ever communal effort to map the world's largest reef system, that stretches 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) down the Queensland coast.

David de Rothschild gets up close to a turtle on the Great Barrier Reef, June 2019.

""It is about reminding the world that this inspirational place is here and we need to do everything we can to keep it in the best shape possible,"" said Ridley, CEO of the non-profit Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef

The Citizens team has been testing the logistics of the census, and hope to finalize details in the next few months.

""It's got a lot of momentum,"" Ridley said. ""But it's still a crazy idea -- you know that, right?""

Andy Ridley, CEO of Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef at Moore Reef off Cairns, Australia, November 17, 2019.

Crisis meeting

The idea for the census came in 2017. Ten severe tropical cyclones in 12 years had smashed parts of the reef, while the ravages of climate change -- rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification -- had left once vibrant coral communities bleached and fragile.

At a conference in the northern city of Townsville, delegates were told the reef was in ""crisis."" They agreed ""dramatic"" change was needed in the way the Great Barrier Reef was managed if it was to survive.

JUST WATCHED The race to save the Great Barrier Reef Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The race to save the Great Barrier Reef 03:49

Ridley chatted with Peter Mumby, head of the Marine Spatial Ecology Lab at the University of Queensland, and Roger Beeden, the director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They needed to know more about the state of the reef, but were coming up short.

Long-term scientific monitoring had only collected detailed information on a small number of reefs -- not enough for marine park managers to form a cohesive response to climate change.

""If you want to understand where there are opportunities to respond after bleaching events, or to actually look after key areas, then we need to have information from a much greater number of reefs,"" Beeden said.

""To try to get that information ... you need to mobilize a huge workforce,"" Mumby said. ""(Scientists) don't have the resources and time to do that kind of survey.""

Ridley was looking for a project, Beeden and Mumby needed people, and so began discussions for the Great Reef Census.

How it will work

For several weeks late next year, anyone -- locals, tourists, fishermen, superyacht and other boat owners -- will be asked to take photos of the reef and upload them to an app. Then, anyone in the world with internet access will be invited to log on to help identify what's there.

You don't need to be a coral expert to become involved. Scientists say some of the most recognizable coral species are also the most important for reef restoration.

""That includes reefs that are dominated by these big plate-like corals, which are really important in stimulating recovery,"" Mumby said. ""Also, reefs that have what we're describing as monumental corals -- coral monuments -- which are exceptionally old, long-lived corals that have survived being damaged for one reason or another.""

Plate coral on the Great Barrier Reef off Townsville, Australia.

""They're like the long, slow, old growth forests that we see in rainforests, the enormous trees,"" Beeden explained.

If scientists can identify the location of corals that naturally work to regenerate the reef, they can help protect them to give the reef the best chance it has to survive the climate crisis.

""As a reef manager, there's not much you can do to stop things warming up. (But) not everywhere warms up at the same rate. If you can map where that variation exists, and find those areas that are really important for recovery ... then you're strategically managing that recovery process as best you can,"" Mumby said.

'The reef is not dead'

Ridley's Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef has been trying to get as many ambassadors onto the water as possible. Along with David de Rothschild, they've hosted model Jarrod Scott and the Australian Dolphins Swim Team.

Mumby bristles at the suggestion that the census is some kind of a publicity stunt.

""There's a very genuine scientific need for this information,"" Mumby said. ""We unashamedly want to have a different conversation about the reef globally, because at the moment the prevailing global conversation seems to be the reef is dead.""

News reports about the reef's demise spread worldwide in 2016 after Outside Magazine published a satirical obituary , horrifying scientists and creating a false perception that they've spent years trying to fix.

""It's deeply frustrating on a couple of fronts,"" Ridley said. ""When you get people believing that we've lost one of the world's greatest natural icons it doesn't inspire action, it actually inspires more apathy.""



Space the size of Italy

Maps of the reef are already being created using satellite images that can see to a depth of 20 meters in clear water. But they only provide a rough outline of the reef.

Details -- like the types of coral that are growing in a particular area -- are added later, when scientists refer to notes from field trips, or take an educated guess based on environmental conditions.

""From satellite imagery you can derive water depth. Water depth and wind creates waves and waves influence where coral types like to grow,"" explained Chris Roelfsema, co-director of the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland.

This year, Roelfsema's team produced the first ever geomorphic map that shows the entire Great Barrier Reef system -- all 3,000 individual coral reefs.

Photos from the reef census will be useful, he said, to help validate the geomorphic maps, and to fill the gaps where no data currently exists.

Scientists are under no illusions about the size of the task ahead.

""The reason why this hasn't happened before is because it's a very large thing to do,"" said Beeden. ""A space the size of Italy with 3,000 reefs, many of which are actually very remote, presents some very substantial logistical challenges.""

Funding is required if the project is going to fulfill its potential to reach parts of the reef that have never been explored before. Ridley is talking with potential sponsors and hopes to announce a deal in January.

He's confident the logistical challenges will be overcome and, by this time next year, scientists will have a much better idea of the state of the reef -- and most importantly, how to save it.

""If we give up on something as amazing as the Great Barrier Reef,"" he says, ""and we think it's gone, and we're OK with that, what are we not OK with losing?"""
367,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/india-air-conditioning-ant-studio/index.html,India has a looming air con headache. Does antiquity hold the solution?,"Written by Amani Al-Aidroos Tom Page, CNN

As the climate crisis makes the world hotter, people are looking to stay cool. By 2050, there could be three times as many air conditioning units on the planet as there were in 2018. But are an estimated 5.6 billion units -- and their accompanying energy demands -- really the answer?

In India, for example, the International Energy Agency believes air conditioning could account for 45% of peak electricity demand by 2050 unless things change. The vast majority of India's electricity supply still comes from coal (although heavy investment in renewables is underway). Pair dirty energy with hydrofluorocarbons , the highly-potent greenhouses gases used in air conditioning units, and you have a solution that's compounding the problem in the long term.

Luckily there's people like New Delhi architect and designer Monish Siripurapu. The founder of Ant Studio is looking at the issue of cooling and is looking back -- way back -- for answers.

India is no stranger to passive cooling systems: the famous stepwells of Rajasthan have used water evaporation to offer relief from the heat for over 1,500 years. Jaali, a type of latticed screen filtering sunlight indoors, are another centuries-old method of keeping cool. But for his solution Siripurapu turned to the Ancient Egyptians, who would fan a porous jar of water to produce cool air.

Dubbed the CoolAnt, Siripurapu's system comprises a honeycomb-like network of terracotta tubes. Water is circulated by an electric pump over the surface of the structure, inspired by a beehive for maximum surface area, he explains. Water evaporates from the terracotta surface when air passes through the tubes, cooling the air.

The studio's cooling system was first conceived for factories and places where machines throw out hot air. With temperatures in summer upward of 50 degrees Celsius near the air exhausts, the CoolAnt system can reduce the heat to the mid-30s Celsius, its creator claims.

Ant Studio's first model in a factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, is topped up with 200 liters of water every week, recycled by the factory, and used 3-4 hours a day, six days a week, explains Siripurapu.

""We are trying to re-adapt this in multiple places for different needs,"" says Siripurapu. ""We have implemented (it) in a café, in a school, and we have done one in a residence.""

Ant Studio's work is also providing custom for local potters, who Siripurapu says are losing out to advanced manufacturing techniques. Typically, one cooling system requires around 700 tubes. Siripurapu says the studio is looking to scale up, and is fundraising and consulting with organizations like the United Nations Environmental Programme.

There is growing interest in a return to vernacular architecture , using localized methods and materials, and bioclimatic architecture , designing to take account of the local climate without needing to use additional energy to cool or heat buildings.

In South East Asia, T3 Architecture Asia has designed affordable apartments in Ho Chi Minh City, and hotels in Cambodia and Myanmar, that feature ventilated roofs, fiber-glass insulation and open-air corridors negating the need for air con. At Expo 2020 Dubai next year, national pavilions will use numerous zero-energy cooling methods, including one inspired by ""barjeel"" wind towers, a concept that dates back 5,000 years.

""Civilization,"" Siripurapu says, ""cannot continue to build the same way that we are doing.""

""Unfortunately, as an architect, we are used to looking at a single client ... we don't really look at the bigger picture,"" he adds. ""The motivation now, what we are trying to do, is (see) how our spaces, our interventions, can actually impact millions of people.""

""We can still be very sustainable and make something really good."""

No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak.

""I was facing this problem: the toilet,"" she explains. ""It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.""

Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. ""The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,"" Zaharin continues. ""The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.""

Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter ""a mountain of poop.""

Since 2016, the Juno spacecraft has circled Jupiter, scanning the atmosphere and mapping its magnetic and gravitational fields. It's also carrying JunoCam , a camera specifically designed to record images of the poles; areas of the gas giant not previously well documented.

""We do not have a formal imaging science team on Juno, so we have turned to the public to help us out,"" says Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, Juno co-investigator responsible for JunoCam.

The amateur astronomy community assists with planning, she explains, determining when JunoCam should photograph the planet and where. Once images are sent back to Earth, the public has access to raw data, which, with a little photo editing know-how, have been processed into some of the most stunning images yet seen of Jupiter.

""I don't know what we would do without them!"" says Hansen-Koharcheck. ""Over the past two years we have come to rely on them ... as important members of our virtual team.""

Kevin Gill: ""A collage of ultra-wide-angle Jupiter views created using reprojected images captured by the Juno spacecraft.""

Among the most prolific and noted submitters are people working in the scientific community. Kevin Gill, a software engineer at The Jet Propulsion Lab, a NASA research and development center in California, works in data visualization and has dabbled in image processing professionally. But he creates JunoCam images for the love of science.

Gill started in 2014 with photographs of Mars from Curiosity Rover and the HiRISE camera orbiting the red planet, before moving on to Cassini, which photographed Saturn and its moons, and other missions. Now he occupies his spare time with Juno.

""JunoCam is a wide-angle camera, but it's based off a black and white grayscale camera,"" he explains. The camera's sensor has filters for red, blue and green, and another for methane detection, capturing separate grayscale images for each.

""As the spacecraft is spinning, JunoCam will take a whole series of pictures ... up to 58 degrees wide and up to 360 degrees long,"" he adds. ""Juno will complete the perijove -- the closest point to Jupiter in its orbit -- and then it'll start transmitting the data.""

Image data takes a couple of days to reach Earth, then it's uploaded for public use. Gill has a semi-automated editing process, cleaning up any bad pixels or dust that may have hit the lens, before removing geometric distortion, then stitching the long, thin image strips together. To turn the composite image into color, he processes the red, green and blue grayscale images in image editing software, ""and, providing all the mapping is right, they will overlap perfectly.""

JunoCam cannot be fully calibrated for true color, says Gill, so there is a degree of creative license over the final image. ""I try to keep the color close,"" he says, while revealing ""what's more pleasing and more telling about what's on the surface.""

And what has Juno been able to see for the first time? ""We've been able to see cyclones up at the poles,"" he says. ""Finally, we have these really crisp images.""

Other personal highlights include Juno looking down into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and recent findings from perijove 24. ""There's one system and it looks like a koi fish,"" Gill says. ""It's (an) orange cloud up in the Northern Hemisphere. I'm really excited to hear if they come up with a scientific explanation for it.""

Elsewhere, Gill is drawn to images of phenomena ""that are difficult to answer"": red, scratch-like stripes on Tethys, the equatorial mountain range on Iapetus and signs of faint rings orbiting Rhea -- all moons of Saturn photographed by Cassini.

Gill believes photography can bring us closer to our planetary neighbors -- sometimes to the point of incredulity. ""When I use HiRISE imagery,"" he says, ""they're taken from orbit and they'll also publish elevation models. I can process those and create a panorama as if you were standing on the ground... You get people commenting saying, 'No, you're lying, that's Arizona, or Utah. I saw that hill!'""

Designed to withstand at least seven orbits, JunoCam is still operational after 26 trips around Jupiter, with the promise of more photography to come. The mission has already been extended once and the team behind it is exploring extending it further, says Hansen-Koharcheck. But there's other ambitious NASA missions on the horizon, says Gill, with a potential trove of photography for public perusal.

Patience is key, however. ""Clipper and Dragonfly are a little way off -- they're in the 2030s -- but I'm still looking forward to the imagery we get back from those,"" says Gill."
370,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/michael-poliza-photographer-modern-explorers-intl/index.html,The world through the eyes of one photographer,"(CNN) — Whether traveling through the vast floodplains of Africa or Thailand's lush mangrove forests, when photographer Michael Poliza explores the world, he practices one principle: take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints.

Over the last two decades, Poliza has traveled to almost 180 countries to capture vibrant and spirited photos focused on intimate moments of animals and the world's least-documented landscapes.

Capturing these special moments requires patience and an understanding of the erratic rhythms of the wilderness, but even the most seasoned wildlife photographers are not immune to nature's whims.

One day in 2011, while soaring over Purnululu National Park in Western Australia, Poliza and his helicopter pilot were too absorbed by the beauty of its beehive-like rock formations to notice they were headed straight towards a storm.

""Lightning was coming down left and right and up and down, and I had an open door in the back of the helicopter which you cannot close, so the rain was coming in. It was pitch black,"" said Poliza.

It was, he remembers, a ""scary afternoon,"" but not a wasted one. As documented in his latest book ""The World,"" the combination of imposing edifices and bottled lightning is among his most stunning photography to date.

These beehive-like rock formations found in Purnululu National Park, Western Australia, are known as the ""bungle bungles."" Photo © 2019 Michael Poliza. All rights reserved.

A man of reinvention

Poliza, now 62, wasn't always a photographer, starting as a child actor in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, before founding multiple IT companies in the early internet boom. But in 1997, after more than a decade of transatlantic business trips, he sold his companies, packed up his things, and set out to explore the world.

He bought a 75-foot boat and embarked on a 1,009-day expedition around the world to raise environmental awareness, with photographers and filmmakers in tow. Together, they documented the journey, broadcasting photos via satellite and online as they explored remote areas of the world only reachable by ship.

During the trip, while searching for great white sharks in Australia, Poliza learned to appreciate that nature cannot be forced. After five days without a sighting, a friend of Poliza's was getting impatient and offered money to their guide to speed up the search. ""There was nothing he could do ... that was a very good lesson to understand that you cannot push nature to do anything.""

A new beginning

When his journey came to an end, Poliza, then in his mid-40s, was confronted with what to do next. He sold his ship and stopped in Cape Town, South Africa, on the way to Madagascar. Besotted, Poliza canceled his trip to Madagascar, bought a house in Cape Town, and began exploring the continent.

He joined his friends on safaris, capturing photos of Africa's spectacular landscapes and vast range of animals. When some of his photographs began appearing in advertisements, his career started to take off. ""I was just playing with my camera and trying to shoot things a bit different,"" said Poliza.

""To be honest, I didn't really have a plan ... I didn't wake up in the morning and say, 'I want to take a photo of wildlife or landscapes or a specific animal,' it just drifted into that.""

One day, after returning from a safari, Poliza realized he had a problem. ""I opened up my mail (and) I saw that my bank account wasn't smiling at me anymore. I realized I need to come up with a plan.""

He quickly found a publisher for his first book ""Africa,"" released in 2006, which gained worldwide attention. Poliza's photographs have filled a further 11 books, selling thousands of copies. His latest, "" The World ,"" published by teNeues , is the culmination of his work from the last decade.

""I realized that I had a lot of images that hadn't been used ... so I thought maybe it would be fun to do a book that is a subjective look at the world,"" Poliza said. ""I don't attempt to, and I don't pretend that my set of images covers the whole world. It's just my view of the world.""

No matter where he is, Poliza says it's imperative for him to travel light, support the local economy, and live among the locals. He has formed an emotional attachment to the landscapes, the wildlife, and the people of every place he has traveled to. As the effects of global climate change worsen, he hopes his photos inspire others to commit to saving the planet.

""What I'm trying to do is focus on the beautiful side of the world, and I think there's still a lot of beauty there,"" he says. ""I want people to ... create an emotional reaction with that area, with that place, with our planet, and are more willing to take responsibility that way."""

They were unspooling Earth's history, raising up sections of sediment and ancient rock from beneath the South Pacific. With these samples, scientists are probing some of our most longstanding, and most urgent, questions: What happened in the wake of the dinosaurs? What happens to life when the planet dramatically warms or cools? Can millions of years of Earth history tell us where we're heading?

The abyss may hold the answers.

""The workings of the oceans, the Earth's environment and climate are all recorded in the sediments,"" explained Anthony Koppers, a professor of marine geology at Oregon State University.

Drill beneath the sediment on the sea floor and you hit the oceanic crust. One advantage of drilling into oceanic crust is it's approximately 7 kilometers thick, while on land it is many times thicker, explained Koppers. That allows scientists to sample closer to the Earth's mantle."
372,,http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/inge-solheim-modern-explorers/index.html,'It's the most hostile place': Life at the North Pole with Inge Solheim,"(CNN) — Should you ever encounter a polar bear in the wild, Norwegian explorer Inge Solheim has some advice.

Step one: Make a lot of noise. ""I'm banging kettles ... I'm shouting and trying to scare it off,"" he told CNN. If it persists, step two: Use pepper spray or a flare gun. Aim the flare gun in front of the animal -- you don't want the flare sailing over the bear's head and exploding behind it, he explains. Retreating is the next option if there's a viable exit. The absolute ""last resort,"" in the event of an attack, is using live ammunition.

Solheim, who's been visiting the North Pole for the past 20 years, knows his place in the icy wilderness' natural order. ""It's their home; they belong there, I don't,"" he says. ""I have to do everything I can not to disturb a polar bear and try not to put myself in a situation where I have to kill one.""

He adds that, despite the dangers polar bears pose, statistically, the biggest risks he faces in the Arctic is carbon monoxide poisoning or a tent fire related to the gasoline stoves used for cooking. But so far so good for Solheim.

Raised in the village of Otta in central Norway, Solheim was never apart from nature. ""I grew up with stories about the old explorers: (Fridtjof) Nansen, (Roald) Amundsen, (Ernest) Shackleton, (Otto) Sverdrup,"" he says. ""They were rock stars back in the day.""

A childhood in the mountains was traded for a career in finance, before Solheim quit for the call of the wild. He went on to become a much sought-after guide, leading injured soldiers in the Walking With The Wounded expeditions to the North Pole in 2011 and South Pole in 2013, along with Prince Harry.

The pull of the North Pole has remained a constant, with 20 expeditions so far. ""It sounds stupid, probably, but because it's the hardest and most hostile place, it's also the most rewarding place for me,"" he explains. ""I feel that the North Pole brings out the best in me.""

""I think the lessons you learn out here and the confidence you build is much deeper and more solid than what you can learn in the office life or private life at home,"" he adds. ""Out here you're stripped down to the basic of what it is to be human.""

Yet, despite his achievements, he's reluctant to be labeled an explorer. ""I never felt comfortable in those shoes,"" says Solheim, comparing his exploits to the early polar pioneers. ""What these guys did was so far beyond what I can do today.""

In homage to his forebears' superhuman feats, Solheim has followed in their footsteps. In 2005, he took part in a recreation of the race between Britain's R. F. Scott and Norway's Amundsen to the South Pole in 1911 (Greenland stood in for Antarctica as dogs are now prohibited from the continent, over concerns that they could introduce diseases to seals, or disturb wildlife ). For three months he donned period gear, used period equipment and ate period rations for the 2,500-kilometer race. Solheim says his hefty caribou hide sleeping bag was the best he's ever used. As in real life, the Norwegian team won.

The times are changing in the Arctic; even pollution is finding its way into the remotest corners of the world

""We are polluting and we're spoiling our self and ruining the world around us,"" Solheim told CNN on a guiding trip to the Svalbard archipelago. ""I think going out here and experiencing the beauty, and feeling at one with nature, I think it reminds us that we have to protect it.""

Solheim's attempt to reach the North Pole this year was thwarted. A 700-kilometer solo speed ski from Siberia to the pole would have made him the first person to trek from land to the North Pole since 2014 . But the attempt was put on ice when he didn't receive permission to depart from a Russian military zone.

Still, there's always next year, and Solheim already has a date penciled in the diary: March 15, 2020. ""I'm working on funding, and with the right authorities in Russia, so unless they decide to have some military exercise again at the same place, I'm optimistic,"" he told CNN."
373,2019-09-18 00:00:00,http://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/health/japan-cyberdyne-brain-wave-exoskeleton-wellness-scn-hnk-intl/index.html,The wearable cyborgs that use brain waves to power up your muscles,"Tokyo (CNN) Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down last year.

""It came out of nowhere,"" says Sorensen. ""I'd been fine and exercising every day, but it just started with tingling in my fingertips then progressed.""

Diagnosed in October 2018 with Guillain Barre syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the body's nervous system, she never expected to walk again.

But earlier that year, the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center in Jacksonville, Florida, became the first US center to use a unique rehabilitative technology developed in Japan -- the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL).

HAL -- essentially a wearable cyborg -- helps those with spinal cord injuries and muscular dystrophy regain their movements and strengthen their nerves and muscles. Known as exoskeletons, they're a type of lightweight suit, with joints powered by small electric motors, that serve as mechanical muscle.

Here's what's truly mind-blowing: Patients use their brain waves to control them.

When Sorensen heard about the brain wave-controlled exoskeleton, which was developed by Japanese roboticist Yoshiyuki Sankai, she knew she had to give it a try. She was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding a few months later in December.

But it's not just those with disabilities or injuries who stand to benefit. By 2050, there will be more than 2 billion people over age 60, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and exoskeletons could offer a solution to the world's aging population.

In the future, as human bodies wear down with age, an exoskeleton -- powered by active minds -- could help people stay on their feet.

by 2023, according to research company Markets and Markets. With such huge potential applications available, the global medical exoskeleton market will be worth an estimated $2.8 billion by 2023, according to research company Markets and Markets.

Users in the driving seat

When Sorensen first tried HAL, she could barely move across flat surfaces.

A trained physiotherapist at the Brooks Center helped her fit HAL over her waist and trousers, connecting her to sensors that help pick up faint bio-electric signals on the surface of the skin, which communicate a patient's intention to move. Once HAL receives these signals, it helps support the person's movements.

Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became paralyzed from the neck down in 2018.

But you can't just put on HAL and expect to be sprinting in seconds. Rehabilitation requires time, determination and the help of a physiotherapist and a body weight harness that ensures patients are supported and kept upright while they use HAL on a treadmill. During that training, physiotherapists keep a log of each patient's motions and the settings used -- from walk to jog mode. They can monitor the user's movements and adjust the settings accordingly, so their movements come more naturally.

Sorensen says it initially felt like HAL was doing most of the work by helping induce her muscles to make small leg movements that mimic natural walking patterns, but then she found herself increasingly in the driving seat.

""After the first couple times, your brain connects to HAL, and I could see I was moving my legs myself,"" she says. ""It was just incredible -- my heart was just bursting.""

Kristen Sorensen was determined to walk at her daughter's wedding. She overcame her paralysis by training with HAL.

Usually it takes those with less severe mobility issues than Sorensen between two to 10 tries for patients to get used to HAL so that the sensors and the brain can start working together, according to Sankai. But after almost 40 training sessions, each lasting an hour-and-a-half, Sorensen was back on her feet, albeit with the support of a walker. She made it to her daughter's wedding.

Currently, Sankai's exoskeletons are helping patients restore their muscle movements in Japan, the Philippines and in Germany and Poland.

Tech for good

The brain behind HAL is bespectacled billionaire roboticist Sankai. He heads up Japanese company Cyberdyne -- founded in 2004 -- where his vision has been to create these ""wearable cyborgs"" designed to ""fuse man, machine and information.""

And while the name of Sankai's firm might recall the scary Cyberdyne Technologies that created villainous robots in US science-fiction blockbuster ""Terminator,"" the Japanese roboticist wants to create tech not for war, but for peace and rehabilitation.

Yoshiyuki Sankai wants to augment humanity with his exoskeleton devices.

When Sankai was a 9-year-old in the 1960s, he discovered ""I, Robot"" by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov and became entranced by the positive applications of technology. He decided to pursue engineering at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. In 1998, Sankai made his first HAL prototype, which became the world's first , and spent the next decades refining the product into the sleek, lightweight version of today.

Previously robotic-assistance tech centered on military use. But these days, HAL is part of a wave of research that focuses on using exoskeleton tech to treat ailments or provide support to wearers. For example, researchers at Harvard unveiled a soft exosuit in 2014 that enhances a patient's strength, much like HAL. And automobile makers like Ford are using exoskeletons on factory floors to reduce worker fatigue . HAL, too, has potential beyond the medical field, with everything from rescue and support and labor intensive factory work to entertainment and elderly care.

""The average age of workers (in Japan) is very high, so these technologies can help them and gradually increase elderly people's physical functions so they can remain independent,"" says Sankai.

But when new technologies are created there are few or no social and legal rules to regulate them.

Sankai says these measures must be debated in advance so all parties involved in the manufacture and use of technologies such as exoskeletons maintain control over the development direction. Cyberdyne has two ethics committees; one dedicated to promoting research; the other on standing by the idea of peace when creating and developing new devices and technologies.

Next up, Sankai and his team are collecting data on their treatment method to better improve their existing medical devices. Sankai's aim is to prepare medical devices that will maintain and increase human health for longer.

For now, he is happy seeing everyone from seniors to the severely disabled regain independence. It's a thought that Sorensen shares.

""When I used HAL, there were people who came from all over the country to use the equipment,"" she says. ""I would like this kind of technology to be more readily available."""

In Bhutanese, the name means ""Land of the Thunder Dragon,"" a nod to the violent storms that pound the rugged mountain peaks and flood the lush valleys.

Bhutan is known as ""the last Shangri-La"" -- a remote Himalayan nation, rich in natural beauty and Buddhist culture, where national happiness is prioritized over economic growth.

Fiercely proud and protective of its traditions, Bhutan has been closed to outside influences for centuries. The nation only opened its doors to tourism in the 1970s and has decided to take a unique approach to westernization, creating a concept known as the ""Gross National Happiness Index.""

Don't be fooled by the name. This is not just a measure of how much people smile and laugh. It's a holistic approach to sustainable development that gives as much weight to human flourishing as it does wealth.

""We in Bhutan are very unique; our democracy is very, very unique ... in the sense we all are grounded very strongly by our national values,"" said Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, who took office in November 2018. ""We do not put personal interest ahead of national interest.

""When we say Gross National Happiness, it is not the celebrative 'Ha ha -- Ho ho' kind of happiness that we look for in life,"" Lotay explained. ""It only means contentment, control of your mind, control of wants in your life. Don't be jealous with others, be happy with what you have, be compassionate, be a society where you can be more than happy to share.

""Our king rightly calls Gross National Happiness as development with values,"" Lotay continues. ""If the policy does not have a good amount of happiness index, if the policy is not every environment friendly, if the policy will not be able to ensure that it will result in the well-being of Bhutanese, that policy will never be approved in the country.""

Gross National Happiness

The Centre for Bhutan and GNH Studies is responsible for administering Bhutan's Gross National Happiness surveys. They ask questions such as ""How happy did you feel yesterday?"" and ""How often do you practice meditation?""

They measure nine key areas of happiness every five years -- psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, ecology, time use, community vitality, culture and living standards. Two surveys have been conducted so far, in 2010 and 2015, with another one due next year.

The house of a working farm sits in a valley nestled in the mountains near the eastern Bhutanese town of Paro.

The 2015 survey sampled more than 7,000 Bhutanese from across the country. It yielded some interesting results.

""The harder components like living standard, health, access to health or access to education and so on, they're improving in Bhutan,"" said Tshoki Zangmo, a researcher at the Centre.

""But the softer components like psychological well-being or the trust indicator that we have in our community vitality domain, those were deteriorating,"" she added. ""The trust indicator within urban areas in the country, they were deteriorating.""

95th out of 156 countries in the That's right. Bhutan is not the happiest country in the world. It actually ranks95th out of 156 countriesin the 2019 World Happiness Report. Much of that has to do with the nation's poverty, and the challenges of bringing economic and social equity to a predominately agricultural society.

Much of the rural population relies on subsistence farming in a high-mountain environment that is vulnerable to climate change. Rugged terrain, frequent floods and landslides hinder development; urban-rural connectivity is poor. Television was only introduced in 1999 and there are still no traffic lights in the capital city.

""There's another misunderstanding ... that Bhutan has claimed that we're the happiest country,"" said Tshoki. ""I don't think we're the happiest country.

""But what sets Bhutan apart from the other countries is that our vision is clear,"" she added. ""Our vision is to reach a state where societies have all the enabling conditions intact, not only the economic aspects but the other aspects as well, such as the environment, the community, having access to health and education and so on.""

Dr. Prime Minister

One only needs to follow 50-year-old Lotay to see the Bhutanese way in action. He exercises daily, but one day is special. Every Thursday he steadily pedals up a steep hill outside Thimphu, Bhutan's capital city. His goal is the 169-foot-tall Buddha Dordenma statue, one of the largest in the world. His mission is two-fold: exercise to strengthen his body, and prayer and meditation to strengthen his mind.

Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering prays outside of Buddha Dordenma.

""When we say stronger, it just does not mean the muscle strength,"" Lotay says. ""It means the mental strength, the strength of your neurons. So those are the ingredients to help your neurons to be very strong.""

After his bike ride, the Prime Minister makes his way to the hospital for rounds. As a urologist and surgeon for more than 20 years, being a doctor is an integral part of what makes him happy. Therefore, he makes time on Thursdays and Saturdays to pursue his passion, which just happens to reflect his values.

""Since I come from a traditional family, I always thought we should help others,"" Lotay says. ""I thought being religious is the way forward, so on that note I really wanted to be a monk. My mother said why not be a doctor so that you can be really of help to the needy ones and so ... I decided to be a doctor.""

As he makes his hospital rounds with residents and interns, Lotay tries to instill the same values he has practiced, values he says he tries to bring to how he approaches two of Bhutan's top goals: universal healthcare and education.

""Health and education are the most powerful social levelers,"" the Prime Minister says. ""So based on that, we have free health and free education in our country. While it is free, it is not easily accessible, easily available for everyone that needs the service.

""I thought we could improve the accessibility of health care services to especially the needy ones, those who are based in the villages,"" he said, adding that ""this pair of hands can only do so much. A surgical blade can only operate a patient at a time.

""I joined politics to see mainly if I can bring in some policy changes,"" he added, ""so that with the stroke of my surgical blade, I treat one patient. With the stroke of a pen I can treat the whole nation.""

Bhutan's future

The country may not rank highest in happiness, yet, but it has made major gains. Thousand of kilometers of roads have been constructed and phone lines installed. Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity accounts for the largest share of its economy.

The World Bank calls Bhutan a developmental success story, with decreasing levels of extreme poverty and improvements in gender equality, as well as a stable political and economic environment.

""Just over the last three to four decades our life expectancy at birth has increased from near 50 to over 70,"" said Lotay. ""With modernization, with decent access to good health care, more nutritious food and health awareness being better day by day, so many Bhutanese now live longer.""

Bhutan places a tight control on tourism, including visits to the Tiger's Nest, a sacred Buddhist site on a cliffside.

Due to the country's natural beauty and native culture, ecotourism is huge. To manage it within the country's Gross National Happiness mandate, Bhutan imposes an ecotourism tax of $250 a day per person, which they use to offset the environmental impact of thousands of visitors. It's been so successful that Bhutan says it's not only carbon-neutral, it's carbon-negative.

The country has long partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to protect native wildlife in numerous parks. Plastic bags have been banned since 1999. Tobacco has been banned since 2005, making Bhutan the world's first smoke-free nation. The Bhutanese constitution mandates that at least 60% of the country remain under forest cover. Right now, said Lotay, they are at 70%.

Despite the need for economic growth, the Prime Minister is confident those priorities will not change for the Bhutanese people.

""When we know that monetary wealth and material wealth will not translate to what you actually want in your life ... peace of mind and happiness ... then why should we target that as our main objective?

""We have to think about the next generations to come,"" he added. ""So, these are the values of Gross National Happiness that we practice. That's why economically we may not be doing very well because all those checks and balances will ensure that whatever we initiate will be sustainable, will be for generations to come."""

Prior to Monday night's last-second loss to the New England Patriots, the New York Jets hadn't been defeated by fewer than eight points all season. Winless and seemingly tanking, the league's worst team was on pace to be outscored by an NFL-record 288 points in 2020.

That is until the Patriots came to town and the depleted, horribly coached, Joe Flacco-quarterbacked Jets had to go out of their way to lock up a loss while visions of Trevor Lawrence danced in their heads.

That's how far the once-glorious, formerly terrifying, historically dominant Pats have fallen. This 30-27 victory might keep them alive in the AFC standings, especially with the playoff field expanded to 14 teams this season, but the box score only reinforced the idea that the Patriots are due for a complete rebuild.

New England allowed the NFL's lowest-scoring offense to put up 27 points, and it might have been a lot more if New York hadn't comically punted on a 4th-and-3 from the Patriots' 41-yard line in the first quarter, possessed the ball for just four plays (resulting in three yards and a turnover) in the fourth quarter and settled for a pair of first-half field goals.

""We felt damn good about how we played all night,"" Flacco said in his postgame news conference.

That's not a good sign if you're the Patriots, who had yet to win outside of Foxborough this year and haven't defeated an NFL-caliber opponent since they beat the Las Vegas Raiders in September.

This team was trending in the wrong direction even before it was gutted by losses in the offseason. Now, it's time to wave the white flag on this campaign and start from scratch.

Tom Brady's replacement, Cam Newton, scored two rushing touchdowns to bring his season total to eight but was held without a touchdown throw for the ninth time in his last 11 games. He completed just three of seven deep pass attempts, and one of the incompletions came on a potential game-winning throw to a wide-open Damiere Byrd in the final five minutes.

Newton wasn't the main problem Monday night, but he still wasn't good enough to lead this team to an emphatic win over a squad that is emphatically bad. A 2-to-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio in the middle of November isn't going to cut it, and it's become obvious that the beat-up 31-year-old just isn't the player he was in his prime.

The Pats should be thinking about top 2021 quarterback prospects Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields and Trey Lance—even if Monday's win might have removed them from the Lawrence sweepstakes. And instead of fighting at the expense of draft stock when we all know their likely ceiling is another one-and-done playoff appearance, they should find out soon if there's any hope for sophomore fourth-round pick Jarrett Stidham at that critical position.

But they can't stop there. The Patriots have mastered the ability to recognize when to move on from players on the verge of decline. That might be harder than ever now that they're so low on talented veterans to exemplify the ""next man up"" philosophy, at least relative to previous years—but nobody is immune to an occasional rebuild, and New England can't afford to cling to a roster that is unlikely to bear fruit in the next couple of years.

Cornerback Stephon Gilmore might be the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, but he hasn't been close to as effective in his age-30 season, and there's no way the Patriots should take the $17.2 million cap hit in his walk year in 2021.

Wide receiver Julian Edelman might be a local hero, but he's 34 and his play was falling off a cliff even before he suffered a knee injury last month. In fact, he's caught just eight of the last 21 passes thrown his way and hasn't scored a touchdown in more than 11 months. Move on and save $6.7 million next season.

After opting out of the season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, linebacker Dont'a Hightower will be owed $12.4 million in 2021, but the Patriots would be better off cutting the 30-year-old to save $9.9 million.

Offensive tackle Marcus Cannon is in a similar situation ahead of a $10 million age-33 campaign, and it might be time to break up the McCourty twins (Devin is due $11.2 million next year, and Jason will hit free agency) before they turn 34 in the summer.

It's the end of an era in New England, and that's the way it should be for a team that has never cast aside calculations in favor of emotions. The writing was on the wall throughout the four-game losing streak that preceded Monday's victory, but it's almost poetic that a win over a terrible AFC East opponent contained so little inspiration and proficiency that it ought to be considered the clincher.

As the 2020 college football season continues amid the COVID-19 pandemic with players testing positive, coaches testing positive and games being shuffled around, the NCAA reportedly will not allow coaches to call in plays if they are quarantined.

According to Bryan Fischer of Athlon Sports, the NCAA discussed potentially allowing head coaches to call in plays through cell phones and Zoom if they were quarantined and not at the stadium but ultimately decided against it.

Fischer shared the memo sent to conferences:

Fischer also reported that the same rule will apply for coaches once the college basketball season begins.

The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the college football season before it even began. Most nonconference games were taken off the schedule, the Big Ten and Pac-12 pushed football back until spring before deciding to return for the fall after the other Power Five conferences proceeded, and games have continued to be postponed and canceled.

Trevor Lawrence, arguably the biggest name in the sport, tested positive and missed two games for Clemson, one of which it lost to Notre Dame.

Nick Bromberg of Yahoo Sports noted more than 30 games were canceled or postponed through the first nine weekends of the season before 10 were called off in Week 10 alone. Among the Week 10 cancellations were multiple Pac-12 games for teams that had not yet played a game this season.

Coaches have not been exempt either, as Arkansas announced head coach Sam Pittman tested positive for COVID-19.

He joined Florida's Dan Mullen and Alabama's Nick Saban as SEC coaches to test positive, although Saban's was later determined to be a false positive after five negative tests.

There will surely be more coaches who test positive before the season ends with cases going up across the country, and they will not be allowed to call plays virtually when that is the case."

Michigan State announced Monday men's basketball head coach Tom Izzo has tested positive for COVID-19 and will self-isolate for 10 days.

Izzo returned a presumptive positive antigen test on Monday morning, and the diagnosis was later confirmed through a PCR test. No other members of the Michigan State program have tested positive since the team began daily antigen testing along with the rest of the Big Ten conference on Oct. 26.

In a statement, Izzo said his symptoms are minor, and he can return to the program on Nov. 17, since his symptoms began on Saturday. In his absence, associate head coach Dwayne Stephens will lead practices, with the 2020-21 college basketball season scheduled to begin Nov. 25.

The 65-year-old Hall of Famer, who has coached at Michigan State since 1995, said he isn't sure how he contracted the virus:

""I've been extremely diligent for many months now, wearing my mask in public and around the office, while adhering to social distancing guidelines. I've been racking my brain, trying to figure out if there was a time where I let my guard down for just an instance. And while I haven't identified any area of exposure, what I have determined is that this shows the power of the virus. You'd be hard pressed to find a coach who's taken more precautions than I have, following all the protocols put in place by our medical team, and yet I still contracted the virus.""

Izzo said in a statement that he will spend his time in isolation watching film and following the instruction of team medical staff, while asking that his family, team and the Michigan State fanbase ""continue to listen to medical experts and follow their advice.""

""I'm proof that no one is immune, but I still believe that there are steps everyone can take to reduce their chances of contracting the virus,"" he said.

According to the school, there were 78 cases of COVID-19 detected among the university population through testing done on the MSU campus during the week of Nov. 2, and there were 22 cases of the virus reported to the school by the Ingham County health department during the week of Oct. 26."

LSU head coach Ed Orgeron told reporters Monday that the Tigers are dealing with a number of positive test results for COVID-19 this week.

""Can't go into detail. It's a very fluid situation,"" he said. ""I can tell you that we do have players that have got COVID, and we do have some players that have quarantined. I can't tell you the numbers.""

The Athletic's Brody Miller reported that ""LSU's game against Alabama on Saturday is in jeopardy after a small COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in four positive cases on the LSU roster and many more players out due to contact tracing.""

As Ross Dellenger of SI.com reported, the outbreak reportedly stemmed from a Halloween party:

Miller reported that LSU will have only one scholarship quarterback available for Alabama, TJ Finley, and won't have any long snappers or tight ends able to play. Myles Brennan has already been ruled out for the game as he recovers from a lower-body injury.

Miller added that the SEC is expected to decide if the game will take place in the next 24 hours. LSU will need at least 53 players to be eligible to play.

If the game is postponed, it would be the second of the season for the Tigers after an Oct. 17 matchup with Florida was pushed back to Dec. 12. That means LSU is out of future weeks to reschedule games, which could force an outright cancelation of the Alabama matchup.

It's been a tough day of news involving the COVID-19 pandemic in the SEC:

LSU is 2-3 on the season and unranked. The defending champions last played on Oct. 31, losing to Auburn 48-11 at Jordan-Hare Stadium."

Nine years ago, former NFL quarterback Vince Young dubbed the Philadelphia Eagles a ""Dream Team"" after an active offseason in which the team signed multiple big-name veterans. His ill-advised quote continues to serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks the team that wins the offseason automatically transforms into an instant Super Bowl contender.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the latest example of an ""it"" team that disappoints.

While much has changed between Young's initial comments and now, one truism remains the same: Teams don't play the game on paper.

It's easy to build a superstar Madden-like roster everyone wants to watch. The same exact thing happened to the Cleveland Browns a year ago after the acquisition of Odell Beckham Jr. Expectations were immediately heaped on a team not ready for the spotlight.

The Buccaneers are slightly different based on the type of talents they acquired, but the results are similar. Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski are great. Yet Tampa Bay is still 0-2 against the NFC South-leading New Orleans Saints after Sunday's 38-3 blowout loss.

Let's go back a moment and alter part of Young's quote to represent the Buccaneers' current situation: ""From Tom to Gronk, to Leonard Fournette to Antonio Brown. I know they are going to do some more things. ... It's just beautiful to see where we're trying to go.""

A vision requires implementation through cohesion and execution. Nothing ever works as planned in the NFL. Every squad faces some type of adversity along the way.

For the Buccaneers, they've met their match with the rival Saints, which makes their path toward a much brighter future extremely difficult.

The biggest difference between the two teams is experience playing together. A majority of the Saints roster has played alongside one another for multiple seasons. A better head coach-quarterback combination than Sean Payton and Drew Brees can't be found.

Ironically, Brady once occupied half the designation alongside Bill Belichick, but the 43-year-old signal-caller chose to start anew in Florida after two decades of dominance as part of the New England Patriots.

Jason Behnken/Associated Press

At its core, football is the world's greatest team sport. All 11 men on the field must work cohesively. The trust and timing necessary to execute at the highest level take time, and they're not automatic.

Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. He has the production, hardware and trophies to back up that statement. Even so, too many assumed he would automatically transition into Bruce Arians' system (via offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich) without any stumbling blocks. Well, that hasn't been the case.

Yes, Tampa Bay is 6-3 overall and very much in the playoff picture. Even so, some of the new additions needed time to get on the same page.

The veteran quarterback has excelled in certain areas. As Pro Football Focus noted, Brady's 26 big-time throws and 17 red-zone touchdowns ranked first and second, respectively, coming into Sunday's contest. In the same breath, he hadn't operated at peak efficiency. In fact, the three-time league MVP ranked 20th overall with a 66.2 completion percentage and 13th with a 72.8 QBR through eight games played.

His performance against the Saints certainly won't help matters, either, with a 57.9 competition percentage and three interceptions.

Brady has been off at points this season. Overall, he's getting the job done sufficiently. Even so, some of his throws have been downright horrid.

The solution isn't to keep adding pieces to the mix. The Buccaneers already absorbed Leonard Fournette into the offense just before the regular season began. Now, Antonio Brown is another hurdle as an additional option to feed when Tampa Bay already featured Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Scotty Miller, Tyler Johnson and the NFL's deepest tight end room.

To be fair, every general manager should continually pursue avenues to improve his team's roster. Not doing so would go against the position's primary directive. Yet a point of diminishing return can be reached, especially with a roster already trying to figure out how to best play alongside one another.

Arians wasn't shy about the mentality Brown needs to help his new team. As he told NBC Sports' Peter King, ""I love Mike. Today he didn't touch the ball till the fourth quarter, but he just wants to win. Chris Godwin, same way. [Rob Gronkowsi], same way. If AB's not that way, then we're going to have a problem.""

Brown caught three passes for 31 yards in his pewter-clad debut.

The head coach has to set expectations and the tone because everyone else follows his vision.

At the moment, the issue with Tampa Bay isn't simply about the continued transition and development of its star players. Arians' admission that the Buccaneers made the move to acquire Brown due to injuries is somewhat troublesome.

Mark LoMoglio/Associated Press

""Offensively, we've been struggling all year with injuries. I wanna be able to make that playoff push with whoever's available,"" the coach said. ""... This team's too good not to make that run and give our guys, our locker room, every chance.""

A mix-and-match approach by throwing whatever a team can against the wall while hoping it sticks isn't ideal.

Sunday's opponent serves as an excellent example of how an organization establishes a philosophy and sticks to it when it addresses problem areas. The Saints brought in safety Malcolm Jenkins and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders this offseason. They're both established veterans on the backsides of their careers who fit into what has already made New Orleans a success. They weren't asked to build a different culture.

Part of the reason Brady became so tempting to a team like Tampa Bay is his experience and legendary work ethic. He came in to show what a championship-caliber approach and study habits look like, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

However, these transitions don't always come naturally. They take time. A team improves through constant reps and understanding of each other's jobs.

For example, the Buccaneers had been quite lucky to start the same five offensive linemen for every game until this past weekend. Left guard Ali Marpet hasn't cleared the concussion protocol, so Joe Haeg started in his stead. Haeg is an experienced lineman. But he's not the expected starter. Tampa Bay allowed three sacks and nine more quarterback hits.

Haeg wasn't entirely responsible for all the blocking issues, of course. Conversely, he wasn't part of the solution, either. Arians told reporters he didn't think the guard played poorly but the Saints ""knew every situation was a passing play. You don't want to put anyone in that situation.""

Mark LoMoglio/Associated Press

Injuries are problematic. No one should deny otherwise. At the same time, those injuries, coupled with further additions, only make the meshing process more difficult, even for an ultra-talented team like the Buccaneers.

As they continue to work through everything, the docket doesn't let up over the final eight weeks of the regular season.

Arians' squad will face the improved Carolina Panthers next week and then deal with back-to-back difficult contests against the Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs before its Week 13 bye. The final leg of the schedule isn't a cakewalk by any means with much-improved opponents in the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons (twice).

Tampa Bay is a good team, but someone is dreaming if he or she thinks it's going to walk into the postseason as the NFC's best. Too much has to come together before the Buccaneers can even be considered such a threat, especially after Sunday's dismantling at the hands of a better squad."

Solis/Associated Press

Sergio Garcia will not participate in the 2020 Masters after testing positive for COVID-19.

Garcia took part in the Vivint Houston Open, which concluded Sunday, but left Saturday after missing the cut.

The Houston Open was the first PGA Tour event to allow spectators since March.

This year's Masters is set to begin Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club after the coronavirus pandemic forced a postponement from its usual date in April.

Garcia was scheduled to compete at Augusta for the 22nd year in a row.

The 40-year-old was once known for disappointing at majors, although he broke that reputation with a win at the 2017 Masters.

Despite missing the cut the past two years, Garcia was confident going into the 2020 event, per Steve Serby of the New York Post:

""I feel good about my game. I feel like I’m hitting the ball nicely. I feel like every part of my game is in very good shape — it obviously could be better without a doubt, but it can always be. But I’m excited about it. I just hope and wish that I can go to Augusta next week and carry some of those good feelings and give myself a shot at a second jacket. I feel good about it.""

He won the Sanderson Farms Championship in October, the 11th PGA Tour win of his career, and he finished under par in three of his past four events.

Several top golfers have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks, including Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and Tony Finau. However, those three are expected to play at Augusta."
382,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/kamala-harris-white-suit/index.html,Why Kamala Harris' white suit speaks volumes,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

As soon as Kamala Harris took to the stage in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday night, social media was abuzz with talk of her outfit. It was a telling sign, for better or worse, of the public scrutiny her fashion will face in the coming years.

But while the Vice President-elect's acceptance speech will surely, and rightly, be remembered for the words of inspiration offered to women in America and around the world, the commentary on her wardrobe was not as trivial as it might seem. Because, rather than distracting from her words, the white pantsuit and pussy bow blouse served to reinforce her message of unity and emancipation.

On a night that Harris credited to the women before her -- ""I stand on their shoulders,"" she said of those who fought for voting rights at the beginning of the 20th century, and of the ""new generation"" that had exercised those rights last week -- she also channeled their symbolism.

The color white has long been associated with the women's suffrage movement, adopted as a symbol of moral purity alongside green for hope and purple for dignity. It also signaled their ethos of nonviolence, an olive branch to those threatened by their then-radical calls for political equality.

But Saturday night wasn't just about the suffragettes. Harris, the first Black and first South Asian Vice President-elect , was standing on the shoulders of Shirley Chisholm, who wore white as she became the first African American woman elected to Congress in 1968. She was standing on the shoulders of Geraldine Ferraro, who wore all-white to accept the role of Walter Mondale's running mate in his 1984 presidential campaign. She was standing on the shoulders of Hillary Clinton, who wore a signature white pantsuit to accept the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

Harris' very deliberate choice of outfit was a gesture of solidarity with the long line of women who have defied expectations in American politics. It demonstrated that the Vice President-elect does not consider herself an exception to the rule, but rather part of a continuum -- of the slowly bending ""arc of the moral universe,"" as President-elect Joe Biden put it in his own speech, quoting Martin Luther King Jr.

Harris' pussy-bow blouse, too, carried historical weight. It evoked the power-dressing of Margaret Thatcher, who wore hers the way male colleagues wore ties, a fitting metaphor for how the UK's former prime minister co-opted and remade the boys' club rules of 1980s British politics. More recently, Melania Trump's choice of the classic garment at very particular moments -- namely an anti-cyberbullying summit and a presidential debate shortly after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape came to light -- were, some speculated (wishfully, perhaps), subtle barbs aimed at her husband's infamous brag.

The Vice President-elect was clearly looking beyond the Trump era to something more universal. But her outfit, reportedly created by American fashion designer Wes Gordon for Carolina Herrera, spoke of recent history in other ways, too.

The women of the Democratic Party have continuously used white in silent protest against a president whom they consider a threat to their rights. At Trump's joint address to Congress in 2017, a group of female lawmakers synchronized their outfits to raise awareness for women's issues, including reproductive rights and equal pay.

They did so again at successive State of the Union addresses, most recently in February this year, as lawmakers marked a century since the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote (though women of color would face voting barriers for decades longer). The sight of Nancy Pelosi in all-white clapping sarcastically behind the President a year earlier, while a great block of white-clad congresswomen sat before him, will also live long in the memory. Harris was standing on all their shoulders, too.

As she assumes an office -- the vice presidency -- that has been communicated through the norms of men's formalwear for over 230 years, Harris' wardrobe choices will continue to generate discussion. The attention may be unwelcome, but the lack of precedent could also prove liberating. She has an opportunity to remake the role in her own image, creating a reference point for the many women who will, inevitably, follow in her footsteps. As she told the crowds in Delaware, ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I won't be the last.""

Harris has already offered snapshots of her more casual side, notably her apparent preference for Converse sneakers. While her Instagram feed is largely populated with the dark pantsuits she has traditionally favored, a video posted shortly after her projected victory was announced shows her in workout gear as she celebrates with Biden on the phone (""We did it, Joe!""). This kind of unguarded moment is a requirement of the social media age, but it offered something refreshing and stripped of the usual polish.

Many female leaders have, understandably, decried the public interrogation of their fashion choices. German chancellor Angela Merkel has bristled at the double standards, denouncing the ""l etter-writing "" instigated by outfits seemingly selected to deflect attention. Former British Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile, spent much of her premiership subjected to unwarranted tabloid criticism of offhand fashion choices that would have been ignored if made by a male counterpart.

Yet, only the most blinkered political observers can deny the power of clothing, should leaders choose to exploit it.

On the biggest stages, and at the most crucial moments, female politicians have embraced unspoken symbolism -- whether that's Jacinda Ardern adopting a hijab in an act of unity with Muslims in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack, or congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez applying red lipstick like "" war paint "" as she challenged a fellow representative for alleged sexism.

On Saturday night, Harris not only showed that she is aware of this power, but that she is unafraid to harness it."

David Hockney's 1980 landscape painting ""Nichols Canyon"" will go on offer at the upcoming Phillips contemporary evening sale, scheduled to take place on December 7.

The painting carries an estimate of around $35 million, according to a press release from Phillips, and is billed as ""unequivocally the most important landscape by the artist in private hands."" The hefty price tag makes it Hockney's most expensive landscape to ever appear at auction, and, if its estimate is achieved, would place the work in the artist's top three most expensive auction results.

""Nichols Canyon"" marked Hockney's embrace of landscape painting following a brief foray into photography in the 1970's, and was included in the landmark 1981 exhibition ""A New Spirit in Painting"" at the Royal Academy in London. The painting will be on view at Phillips London until November 1, then travel to Hong Kong, and finally New York before heading to auction.

Hockney described the process of painting the work in a statement: ""The moment you live up here, you get a different view of Los Angeles. First of all these wiggly lines seem to enter your life, and they entered the paintings. I began Nichols Canyon. I took a large canvas and drew a wiggly line down the middle which is what the roads seem to be. I was living up the hills and painting in my studio down the hills, so I was traveling back and forth every day, often two, three, four times a day. I actually felt those wiggly lines.""

The sale of ""Nichols Canyon"" comes near the end of an eventful year for the artist and his market. In February, his iconic painting ""The Splash"" (1966) sold at Sotheby's London for £23.1 million ($29.8 million).

384,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/wana-udobang-body-viral/index.html,My body went viral twice. This is how it felt,"Written by Wana Udobang Lagos

Wana Udobang is a Nigerian writer, performer and TV personality. All opinions expressed in this article belong to Udobang.

The first time my body went viral, it was a photograph I posted on my Instagram. I'm wearing a blue swimsuit and I'm standing with one hand on my hip striking a pose on the beach in Havana, Cuba. I certainly didn't expect the number of reposts and neither did I expect people commenting in my inbox with words like ""Brave,"" ""Inspiring,"" and ""Confident.""

As far as I was concerned, I was just wearing beach-appropriate clothing while on holiday. Why is it that me documenting these seemingly normal activities conjure such loaded words?

But, in fact, my body has always been one of the major narratives in my life. For example, many of the nicknames I was given as a child were related to my fatness, like ""fatty bum bum"" -- said in endearment. My body seems to precede everything else about me -- at least in other people's minds.

As a result, I have always been aware of its ranking on the beauty and desirability front. In fact, whenever my body is the subject of conversation, someone usually says something about my ""pretty face,"" leading me to believe that I might have had the chance to be beautiful, but because of my body, I did not make the cut.

And while self-love has been a necessary part of shaping my own self-perception into something positive, it is not the panacea it is often touted to be. It hasn't quite insulated me from the impact of other people's thoughts about my physical form.

Second time around

The second time my body went viral, it was the result of a collaboration between me, Swedish designer Mina Lundgren of Notion of Form, and Nigerian photographer Lakin Ogunbanwo . The project was an exploration of the body as a sculptural form, with photos showing how folds, tan lines and stretch marks can become markers of interest. The result was a series of still images and a short film narrated with poetry that I had written.

The poem reads: ""You came out of your mother's womb, a sculpture of brittle bones and wrinkled flesh glistening in stardust and magic. You are miracle child, a lineage of women defying the notion of form. You are art, a body gorging with stories of love and loss, off absence and abundance, you are wild, soft and free. This is why they call you beautiful.""

The reception was overwhelmingly positive, and again my inbox was inundated with messages applauding my bravery, and admiration for my choice to bare my skin, as well as invitations to speak about body politics on Instagram live chats and television shows. And while part of me will remain bewildered by the fact that images of me can illicit such strong responses, it would be disingenuous to pretend that I don't have some idea why.

Bodies like mine are often deemed undisciplined, lazy, unruly, shameful, lacking in self-control and steeped in low self-esteem, so even any compliments that allude to my level of confidence and assumed boldness are likely to be rooted in bias.

This is also why me posting a photo of myself wearing a bathing suit automatically throws my body -- and all of me --into a ""political"" position, it's seen as me making a statement. But it also denies me the privilege of simply being vain, self-indulgent or just showing off my beach body, as smaller women might do.

The right to be there

I know firsthand how society's perceptions of what we look like shapes how we see ourselves, and sometimes how we live our lives. Once while auditioning for a television gig some hurtful behind-the-scenes information was leaked to me. During a board meeting someone had objected to my suitability for the role, saying that Nigerians don't like to see fat people on TV. I went through each audition stage with this knowledge hanging over my head -- but I still showed up. I still believed I had the right to be there. I got the job in the end.

Over the years my strategy has been to be likeable, overly pleasing and easy going. In professional situations I have refused to complain, even when it would have been justifiable for me to do so, afraid that I could be easily replaced, or that the topic of how I look would resurface. I decided that even if I wasn't the kind of person that people wanted to look at, at least I would be a dream to work with.

Regardless of conversations about expanding the scope of what we mean by ""beauty,"" and the work of body positivity movements over the years, it is impossible to ignore that how we see others -- and ourselves -- has been shaped by the images that circle around us daily.

Becoming a conduit

Over the last decade, I have been very lucky to have been involved in making art, and specifically performance, which has given me the means to connect with my body in more than just the obvious ways. From performing on a stage or in front of a camera to collaborating with visual artists, I have been able to see my body as both physical and metaphysical material, form and content, object and subject; a conduit for sharing and channeling creativity -- and not just an end in itself.

But until people are willing to take responsibility for their own limited views about beauty and what shape a body should be (especially a woman's body), I have settled on coming to terms with the fact that I will continue to oscillate between my own ideas about beauty and my body, and other people's expectations."

With no end to the global pandemic in sight, fashion and sportswear brands have been quickly adapting their lines to include face masks decorated with logos and stylish patterns.

While cloth masks made of traditional materials can help slow the spread of Covid-19 , according to the World Health Organization, some labels are going one step further. They're marketing new accessories, and in some cases entire clothing lines, as having antimicrobial properties -- applications that inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, or reduce viral activity. But what does antimicrobial fashion do, and can it provide extra protection during a pandemic

In recent months, brands including Burberry have introduced masks that, they claim, are protected from microbes and germs. Burberry's forthcoming beige and blue designs come in the label's signature check. Under Armour's multi-layered UA Sportsmask, which is ​marketed as having antimicrobial properties, sold out in under an hour when it was released this summer.

And Diesel is selling denim that it claims is ""virus-fighting."" The Italian brand announced that it will use a technology called ViralOff -- which it says ""physically halts 99% of any viral activity"" -- in a number of items in its Spring-Summer 2021 collection. ViralOff works ""by interacting with key proteins, inhibiting the virus from attaching to textile fibers,"" reads Diesel's press release.

In the US, brands cannot claim that products will protect wearers from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, without providing sufficient evidence. ​Therefore, some labels simply allude to extra protection or hygiene, though the small print often reveals that antimicrobial treatments are only intended to inhibit bacterial or viral growth, not protect the user from pathogens. (Washing garments with soap once a day, as recommended by the World Health Organization , or WHO, can also kill bacteria and viruses.) The FDA and CDC ​did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for information regarding products that have been tested ​or submitted for formal approval.

Without sound scientific testing by brands across the board, it is difficult to assess whether antimicrobial treatments can protect wearers from the novel coronavirus, according to Amy Price, a senior research scientist at Stanford Anesthesia Informatics and Media (AIM) Lab who has advised the WHO on its face mask guidelines.

""The challenge is that sometimes claims are made, but they aren't tested on the actual masks or with the actual virus,"" she said over a video conference call. ""So they're like gimmicks."" ​Price has not tested any of the products mentioned in this article.

Some companies say they have tested their products with SARS-CoV-2, like IFTNA's PROTX2 AV that Under Armour says it uses, and HeiQ's Viroblock , which, according to the company's website, is used by numerous brands to produce reusable face masks, coats and even mattresses . IFTNA says recent lab testing ""shows PROTX2 AV's efficacy against Covid-19,"" while HeiQ claims that Viroblock, which is added to the fabric during the final stage of the textile manufacturing process, has been ""tested effective against Sars-CoV-2."" CNN has not been able to independently verify these claims.

But some ​others have not revealed which viruses, if any, their products have been tested on, muddying the waters of so-called ""antimicrobial"" fashion.

Price, who studied the effectiveness of fabric masks alongside AIM Lab's director, Larry Chu, said there are a number of variables that determine how much protection a product offers.

""Oftentimes, bacteria and viruses have different ways of reproducing, and different things are effective against them,"" she explained. ""With antimicrobial (treatments) it's important to know what you're dealing with, what it's been tested with and if it's safe for human skin.

""(With) anything that you put on your face -- especially that you're going to be wearing day in and day out -- you want to make sure it is really something that is safe or FDA approved.""

Murky claims

Since the coronavirus outbreak was labeled a pandemic by the WHO in March, the guidance around mask-wearing has continued to evolve. Many countries now require face coverings to be worn in public spaces in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

""If you're wearing (a mask) and the people around you are wearing it, we've seen that transmission (of the coronavirus) probably drops in the 90% plus range, which is pretty good odds,"" Dr. Atul Grover, executive director of the Association of American Medical Colleges Research and Action Institute, told CNN in August.

In their study, Price and Chu found that cloth masks can ""do better than surgical masks in terms of blocking particles,"" Price said -- but only ""if they're made well,"" with a triple-layered and tight-fitting design. (The WHO has produced a series of videos on recommended materials and fit, based on the pair's research.)

""Ultimately, it's about having some form of barrier with multiple layers,"" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta ""Ultimately, it's about having some form of barrier with multiple layers,"" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN video from April on the benefits of wearing a mask.

There have been few published studies, so far, examining the impact of antimicrobial and antiviral fabric treatments on the new coronavirus. And there is no single type of technology being used by clothing brands, so each would require extensive individual studies to judge their efficacy. It will be important to consider whether a treated fabric is able to neutralize the virus, and if so, how long it takes (""the virus can get in within nanoseconds,"" Price said), as well as the number of washes the antimicrobial treatment can withstand. ​

Earlier this month, Polygiene, which recently partnered with Diesel and is the maker of ViralOff, said in a press release that the antimicrobial textile treatment technology can successfully kill 99% of SARS-CoV-2 from textile surfaces within two hours. While Price has not tested Polygiene's ViralOff technology, she believes two hours is ""a lengthy disinfection time,"" explaining that the garment could contaminate skin, food, water or mucous membranes during that period if it makes contact.

Polygiene describes its textile treatment as ""durable,"" but advises users to ""wash less and only when needed."" Over email, the company clarified that it cannot guarantee ViralOff will continue to work after machine washing -- it recommends gently washing garments treated ViralOff by hand or not washing at all -- but said that another formula is currently in development.

Under Armour and Diesel did not return CNN's requests for comment, while Burberry would not elaborate on the type of antimicrobial treatment used in its masks.

Unresolved questions

As companies race to appeal to anxious consumers, ​claims about antimicrobial garments' effectiveness against the novel coronavirus itself appears to be expanding. HeiQ claims that its aforementioned treatment technology kills 99.99% of the virus within 30 minutes, while fabric maker IFTNA claims that their product neutralizes over 99% of the virus in as little as 10 minutes thanks to its ""residual killing power.""

Both companies say their products have also been tested with other pathogens, including strains of influenza and different types of coronavirus, with each lasting 30 washes, but CNN is unable to independently verify these claims.

But the companies vary in how they describe the protection offered by their products. Giancarlo Beevis, president of IFTNA, said over email: ""It will protect the wearer from potential transmission points on anything treated with PROTX2 AV."" HeiQ, on the other hand, does not claim that its product can protect people against pathogens -- a legal disclaimer on its website says the treatment is meant to protect the textile itself, not the wearer.

""Antiviral fabrics reduce the risk of virus transmission through surface contamination and are added protection from the virus,"" said Rahel Kägi Romero, of HeiQ's marketing team, over email. ""HeiQ does not want to make health claims and give people a wrong sense of security. Antiviral fabric is one factor in keeping people safe, but it needs to go hand in hand with other measures, such as keeping a social distance, wearing face masks when in crowded areas and washing hands regularly.""

While keeping your clothing virus-free could, potentially, reduce the chance of cross-contamination, there is still much that is unknown about SARS-CoV-2. The primary routes of transmission are still contested , as is the amount of the virus required to make a person ill. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although the possibility hasn't been ruled out, ""touching a surface or object that has the virus on it... isn't thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""

The possible benefits of antimicrobial fabrics are even less clear for garments that don't usually come into contact with the face, like jeans, Price said. ""Unless you're going to just be sitting there, rubbing your legs and then rubbing your face, then what's the point?"" she asked. Plus, even if a textile treatment is proven to reduce certain viral activity, that doesn't necessarily make it practical for all types of garments.

Price doesn't discount the potential value of antimicrobial textiles, but so far, she said, the studies offer an incomplete picture. ""Should this be tested? Yes,"" she said. ""(But) it should absolutely not be marketed to the public through press releases and industry brochures before the results are vetted and replicated in a fair test of treatments, like a well-run randomized clinical trial.

""Even FDA trials contain three phases and aftermarket surveillance... If a person feels safer wearing a microbial textile, and this safety is only a marketing illusion, it could cost them their lives or their health."""
386,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/kylie-minogues-gold-hotpants-remember-when/index.html,Remember When Kylie Minogue's gold hotpants stole the turn of the millennium?,"Written by Hannah Lack, CNN

With its patchwork of fruit stalls and cheap household goods, North End Road market in West London isn't famous for its celebrity clientele. But it did supply one item of clothing to Kylie Ann Minogue that will live on in pop culture history for ever: A pair of gold lamé hotpants.

If ever there was a bargain, the short shorts were purchased in the late '90s for less than a pack of gum by the singer's longtime friend, artist Katerina Jebb while the two were shopping together.

""She and I love flea markets and vintage clothes -- all the places you can find really unusual things nobody has,"" said Jebb during a phone interview, ""I saw them and said, 'Give me 50p, I'm getting these for you.' She put them on when we got home and they were perfect. She wore them for a fancy-dress party soon after.""

Unearthed from the back of Kylie's underwear drawer for her ""Spinning Around"" video in 2000, those scant few inches of spandex unleashed pandemonium -- the British tabloids' obsession with her derrière stretched to a breathless campaign to have her backside listed as a World Heritage site of outstanding natural beauty.

The hotpants became for Kylie what the conical bra is to Madonna, and the fishnet body stocking is to Cher. But the Aussie pop princess's look was less calculated than either and suited her adopted city: There's something very London about turning an afternoon's cut-price market stall find into the night's clubwear, encapsulating a playfulness and spontaneity that has long been part of Kylie's charm. ""She's as free as a bird in those things,"" said Jebb. ""It's about liberation, they're not vulgar. Those hotpants are iconic, they're a part of pop history.""

""Spinning Around"" was Kylie's unabashed return to pop. After a handful of indie years, including the brilliant shock of a haunting murder ballad with Nick Cave, the track was a three-minute blast of shiny millennium optimism that became her first UK No.1 in a decade. She wrapped up that year by arriving at the Sydney Olympics on a giant flip-flop and was back at the top of the charts the next with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" a sleek, woozy earworm that went to No.1 in over 40 countries and became her best-selling single of all time. In the accompanying video, she wore an outfit as slippery and clever as the song itself: A white minimalist melange of hoodie, jumpsuit and cowl designed by Fee Doran of underground London label Mrs. Jones. Flashing body parts through multiple drapes and slits, the video avoided X-rating only with the aid of some industrial-strength double-sided tape.

Kylie's ability to pull off almost any costume, from knickerbockers to harlequin Pierrot, has allowed her to be a sartorial chameleon for over three decades now, with a restless wardrobe that suits her mindset. ""My style is very much at the mercy of my mercurial nature ... I dislike being boxed into anything in all aspects of life. And so it is with clothes,"" she wrote in her 2012 book ""Kylie / Fashion.""

And to think it all started with her TV character Charlene, the garage mechanic who accessorized her khaki dungarees with a wrench on long-running Australian soap ""Neighbours."" From that fashion ground zero, Kylie has shape-shifted through a confection of guises.

Her 1987 single ""The Loco-motion"" with its rah-rah skirts and polka-dots transported her from Australia to London and into the scrunchie-strewn Stock Aitken Waterman years. The producing trio infamous in the 80s for their phenomenally successful, conveyor-belt approach to hits, packaged her into the pop princess immortalized forever by the poodle-perm hair-hat and megawatt smile she wore on the cover of her 1988 debut album ""Kylie."" It went six times platinum in the UK and by 1989 she was already unveiling her likeness in wax at Madame Tussaud's. (So many fans have posed with her waxwork it's had to be replaced four times to date.)

Kylie was so successful, so early, she's done her growing up public: The bubblegum girl-next-door persona was banished when her curls were chopped into a pixie-crop in the early 90s, and she ditched matching waistcoats with Jason Donovan for Michael Hutchence and Hysteric Glamour minidresses. In 1992, she wriggled free from the manufactured Stock Aitken Waterman straightjacket and signed with dance label DeConstruction Records, prompting covers for i-D and The Face. (The latter's 1994 cover of Kylie in mirrored aviators was one of its bestselling issues.)

Submerged in London's nightlife during the mid-'90s, Kylie formed loyal friendships with the city's designers, including Vivienne Westwood (she met her longtime stylist William Baker on Westwood's shopfloor), Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, John Galliano and later Gareth Pugh. Across the Channel in Paris, a city close to the performer's heart (the George V Hotel named their ""Pink Pearl"" cocktail in her honour), she found a kindred spirit in Jean Paul Gaultier, whose naughty exuberance is the perfect match to Kylie's own. On tour, Gaultier has dressed her as an anime geisha, in a silver Barbarella corset with glitter planets orbiting her head, and as a Greek goddess by way of Ibiza. ""You change, you transform yourself, you adapt with the evolution of times, fashions and desires ... and still you always stay yourself: our Kylie! This quality is the privilege of 'Les Grandes,'"" Gaultier wrote in his introduction to ""Kylie: Fashion."" (He added: ""Kylie cherie, a point I have in common with you: your absolute eye and taste for goodlooking men. You choose them as well as you choose your dresses."")

When Kylie was forced to cancel her 2005 tour midway to undergo treatment for breast cancer, her fashion friends came out in force to clothe her 2006 comeback: Dolce & Gabbana designed a leopard-print bodysuit complete with pointed ears and scarlet boxing gloves, Gareth Pugh dressed her as a human glitter-ball, and John Galliano rolled her in jewels and apricot-coloured ostrich feathers as a bombastic cross between Mae West, a Las Vegas show girl and bedazzled bird of paradise.

At that time, the so-called ""Kylie effect"" of her diagnosis lead to an unprecedented increase in mammography bookings, and the singer has since harnessed her position in the public eye by fronting breast cancer campaigns and remaining vocal and active in raising funds for cancer charities.

Fourteen years after being forced to cancel headlining Glastonbury due to her diagnosis, last summer Kylie stepped onto the festival's Pyramid stage for the Legends slot. At 51, she was young for the slot -- previous Legends include Dolly Parton, Shirley Bassey and James Brown -- but with more than 40 hit singles and over 80 million records sold, multiple sell-out tours, three Brits and a Grammy, few would argue her presence there wasn't entirely deserved. Her set was the most watched of the festival. At Glastonbury, she morphed through no less than five outfit changes, including a dress drenched in gold, in knowing homage to those Midas hotpants of 20 years ago.

Today, you'd need white gloves to handle them -- the item has taken up climate-controlled residence in the Melbourne Arts Center in Kylie's hometown, slightly worse for wear from writhing atop the bar in ""Spinning Around.""

They live alongside over 1,000 key pieces showcasing the singer's ever-evolving style, including the oversized Chevignon jacket from ""The Loco-motion"" video, and a poignant costume from 1998's ""Intimate and Live"" tour, which marked the first outing of her showgirl persona. Designed by Kylie and her stylist William Baker, every bugle bead and pink, silver and white sequin was hand-sewn by the pair, with the help of Kylie's mother and grandmother, at her kitchen table in Melbourne. ""I think the down-to-earthness of her as a person is very important to communicate,"" said Jebb. ""She isn't lofty or precious. Style to her is as much behavior as it is superficial adornment. Kylie is still here and she's still delightful because it comes from within.""

With her new album ""DISCO"" out now, marking her 15th studio album to date, Minogue is definitely still here."
387,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/moko-facial-tattoo-nanaia-mahuta/index.html,Māori facial tattoos get visibility boost following appointment of New Zealand foreign minister,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Politician Nanaia Mahuta made history this week when she was named New Zealand's first Indigenous female foreign minister . But for those with traditional Māori tattoos, known as moko, she has long been breaking down barriers.

In 2016, after taking part in a Māori tattooing design ceremony, Mahuta became the first female member of parliament to wear lip and chin markings, or moko kauae. Traditional tattoos offer ""positive ways to enable cultural expression and pride in being Māori,"" she tweeted last year.

While still a rare sight in national politics, facial moko are increasingly common in contemporary New Zealand society. The tattoos often carry huge cultural significance for the wearer, telling a visual story that connect Indigenous people to their ancestors.

Each individual's moko is unique and may relate to their social status, occupation or personal and family history. The complex designs also allude to the wearer's genealogy (which in Mahuta's case, ties her to the late Māori queen, Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu and the current Māori monarch, Kingi Tuheitia, according to Radio New Zealand ). Markings on the left and right sides of the face refer to the lineage of a person's father and mother, respectively.

For Te Kahautu Maxwell, an associate professor at the University of Waikato (and the great-great-grandson of a moko artist), getting a facial tattoo around 10 years ago was about ""reclaiming"" his heritage.

""It's about my heritage and my place in society as a historian, an academic and an orator or spokesperson for my people,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It brings me a sense of pride and it brings my people a sense of pride.

""It's also tells the history of my life,"" he added. ""It's something that's very sacred and precious to me.""

Steeped in tradition

The practice of tattooing -- known as tā moko -- is believed to take its name from Rūaumoko, the Māori god of earthquakes and volcanoes. A common origin story involves a mythological figure, Mataoro, who fell in love with and married Niwareka, the daughter of an underworld ruler.

After beating her in fit of rage, Mataoro followed his wife to the underworld to seek forgiveness. While there, Niwareka's father taught him the art of tā moko and, sanctioning his return to the ""upper"" world, marked him with tattoos as a reminder to avoid future acts of evil.

Moko ceremonies have historically been surrounded with customs and ritual. They often took place in temporary outdoor shelters, with the person being tattooed only permitted to eat through a carved funnel, which also helped to reduce the likelihood of infection. The recipient would be expected to abstain from sexual contact or washing while they healed.

Traditionally, men would have markings on their face, buttocks and thighs, while women usually carried them on their lips and chin.

Though tattooing has been practiced in Polynesian societies for centuries, Māori groups developed their own specific techniques and tools. Organic pigments -- made by burning resin from kauri trees, and mixing the soot and with oil or other liquids -- would be chiseled beneath the top layers of skin using tools forged from bird bones, commonly those of albatrosses. (Around the turn of the 20th century, the use of needles became more common, while today, modern tattooing machines are also used.)

The prevalence of facial moko went into decline following the arrival of Europeans -- not least because the preserved heads of tattooed Māori warriors became highly coveted among colonizers. Facial tattoos' association with gangs or criminality in other cultures may also have contributed to their decline.

But with renewed interest in traditional Māori art forms like wood carving, and the increasing acceptance of tattoos in wider New Zealand society, the art of tā moko has witnessed something of a resurgence in recent decades. Maxwell, who is aged 54, said that the ""normalization"" of traditional tattoos in New Zealand began in the 1990s and 2000s, after earlier generations had distanced themselves from the practice.

""There was lots of negativity, not just from non-Māori communities but also from our own communities, because our parents and grandparents were of the mind that the moko should be left in the past.

""But we, the younger generation of that time, weren't prepared to let the art form become a memory, (so we chose) to bring it back as a living art form and to announce to the world that we are Māori.""

Opportunities to educate

While Maxwell said he had ""experienced no stigma"" as a result of his moko, there have been periodic reports of Indigenous people being refused service in bars or restaurants as a result of having visible tattoos.

Yet, there are also a growing number of high-profile figures with facial markings in New Zealand society, such as journalist Oriini Kaipara, who last year became the first woman with moko kauae to present the news on a mainstream TV station.

With growing visibility has come instances of alleged cultural appropriation. Mike Tyson, Rihanna and British pop star Robbie Williams have all been criticized for adopting Māori-style tattoos in recent years. Fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier also stirred controversy in 2007, when he applied moko-inspired designs to Caucasian models' faces for a fashion campaign.

Maxwell, however, welcomes interest from other cultures, seeing it as a chance to educate people about Māori traditions. He described Mahuta's recent appointment as one such opportunity, seeing it as ""significant moment"" for Indigenous communities.

""She will take the moko to places it has never been before -- to consulates, to embassies and government offices throughout the world,"" he said.

Rukuwai Tipene-Allen, a political journalist for Māori Television who wears a facial moko meanwhile said that the appointment ""shows that our culture has a place at an international level.""

""The first face that people see at an international level is someone who speaks, looks and sounds like a Māori,"" she told CNN earlier this week, adding: ""Wearing the markings of her ancestors shows people that there are no boundaries to Māori and where they can go."""

Undeterred by an ongoing pandemic, Kim Kardashian West has revealed she threw a party for herself and dozens of friends on a private island that swapped social distancing for dancing, bike-riding and swimming with whales. But at least she did it humbly.

The television personality is facing a backlash and torrent of memes after sharing pictures of her 40th birthday blowout at an undisclosed island -- an experience which, she says, gave her a slice of normality in challenging times.

""After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time,"" Kardashian West wrote on Twitter.

""We danced, rode bikes, swam near whales, kayaked, watched a movie on the beach and so much more,"" she explained, alongside pictures of guests at the bash.

But the event doubled as a grounding experience for Kardashian West, who wrote: ""I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.""

Her encounter was nonetheless ruthlessly mocked on social media by commentators, many of whom have been unable to seek normalcy on their own private islands during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

Nightmarish scenes from films including ""Midsommar,"" ""Parasite"" and ""The Wicker Man"" were substituted into Kardashian West's tweet by a number of creative Twitter users.

Others found parallels with Kardashian West's party in the art world. Journalist Ronan Farrow tweeted a scene from ""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"" a painting by Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch, known for his depictions of hell.

And New York's Museum of Modern Art felt that Matisse's ""Dance"" best fit the description.

Actor Zach Braff, meanwhile, linked the trip to another ill-fated island excursion by tweeting an image of Ja Rule and Billy MacFarland promoting the infamous Fyre Festival.

And the New Jersey government's official Twitter profile used the saga to point to one of the state's most renowned contributions to popular culture, posting an image of the cast of ""The Sopranos"" enjoying a day trip.

It is unclear how severely the controversy will damage the political fortunes of Kardashian West's husband and Presidential candidate, Kanye West.

But many questioned the logistics of her event, given that Kardashian West neglected to provide details of what her guests' ""multiple health screens"" consisted of.

And the star also received a share of more direct criticism for organizing the getaway at a time when many governments are organizing against non-essential travel, and as the economic impact of the pandemic causes millions to be put under financial pressure.

""Happy birthday. I hope someone got you an alphabet book as a gift, so you can learn to read the room,"" actor and podcaster Kelechi Okafor wrote in a widely shared response to Kardashian West's thread."

He was one of the biggest cabaret stars in the world in the 1920s and 1930s, wooed high society and recorded hundreds of songs. But today Leslie ""Hutch"" Hutchinson is barely remembered in Britain, the place he called home for most of his life.

For those that do remember him, it's often his personal life rather than his musical virtuosity that is invoked.

Hutchinson, a handsome, charismatic Black musician from the West Indies, had a number of relationships with both men and women during his life but some who know his story believe it was one particularly high-profile affair with a wealthy White woman that changed the trajectory of his career.

His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten, wife of Louis Mountbatten, a great-grandson of Queen Victoria -- once picked up by the press -- created a scandal steeped in racism which led to Hutchinson being ostracized from some circles.

Charlotte Breese, author of ""Hutch,"" the only biography on Hutchinson, published in 1999, spent nearly a decade researching the singer and pianist's life and describes him as ""a towering figure in British entertainment"" despite his star having faded.

As Britain marks Black History Month in October, it is a fitting time to pay tribute to Hutchinson's pioneering achievement as someone who earned fame in Britain, Europe and across the former British Empire in the face of widespread racial discrimination, thanks to his own perseverance, talent and charm.

""He was distinctly a man of courage and one of experiment and he was determined to conquer, in a way that was very unusual for the time. By his own lights, I think he succeeded,"" said Breese.

""The things that last, if you choose to listen to his music, are his extraordinary timing and wit and intelligence, his interpretation of the words and his focus on the lyrics, as much as the music. And he was a very strong, effective jazz pianist as well, which is very unusual, to be able to do both.""

While Breese attributes Hutch's disappearance from the public consciousness to the passage of time, some believe racism played a greater role in obscuring his legacy.

Fascinated by Hutchinson's life story, writer, composer and producer Joe Evans wrote a play focused on the Mountbatten affair, staged in London in 2013.

""The crux of it was that the establishment tried to write him out of history in the 1930s and 40s. At the time he was as famous and as talented as Paul Robeson, Fats Domino, Fats Waller and even Duke Ellington,"" explained Evans. ""It was partly because of the scandal at the time with Buckingham Palace... but he was kind of forgotten for a long time.""

Even Hutchinson's great-great-niece, singer-songwriter ALA.NI, knew few details about his history -- from his fleeing the Ku Klux Klan in America to a love affair with composer Cole Porter -- until she listened to a BBC radio play about him in her late teens.

""I had heard a bit about him but this was the first time it all came together and made sense,"" she said.

ALA.NI believes her great-great-uncle's refusal to follow society's rules, particularly in pursuing relationships as a bisexual Black man, regardless of social class, made him a threat to some people, with enduring consequences.

""It was very, very scandalous. We know we have an order that we're supposed to stay in, as Black people, and he did not stay in that order,"" she said.

Society darling to libel suit

Born in Gouyave, northern Grenada, in 1900, Hutchinson learned to play piano as a child. He did well at school and was sponsored by wealthy island residents to leave Grenada for America in 1916 to study medicine. However, it wasn't long before he abandoned his medical studies to perform in bars in Harlem, New York City, said Breese.

""He had always played the piano well but he really focused very hard on his music and started to learn to accompany some of the greats,"" she said. ""All this stuff took great courage in those days, when people didn't travel so much.""

Then, during a trip to Miami, Florida, Hutchinson witnessed violence by the Ku Klux Klan that frightened him enough for him to leave America, around 1923 or 1924, and head to France, taking his wife and daughter with him. ""He realized then that the ceiling was too low in America (for a Black man) and that he must go to Europe,"" said Breese.

Once in Paris, Hutchinson flourished in the thriving jazz scene and became a close friend, protégé and lover of Cole Porter, who was 10 years his senior. He also made the acquaintance of a number of British aristocrats, including then Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), who was to become one of his biggest fans.

""He was good at making friends, he was good at understanding what White folks wanted, he played White folks' music,"" said Breese, adding that his relationship with Porter, probably his ""biggest and most vital"" one, put him in front of the famous composer and songwriter's affluent crowd, allowing him to go ""off to Italy with him, to Venice, to stay and to play in the palazzos (owned by the wealthy).""

Edwina Mountbatten, who had known Hutch in Harlem, encouraged him to move to London around 1927 and he took the English capital by storm, quickly becoming a society darling. He performed at nightclubs and at private parties in grand London houses, even arriving with a white piano strapped to the roof of a chauffeur-driven car. He also reportedly seduced a string of well-connected women and men, helped no doubt by his good looks, virtuoso performances and debonair charm.

""By the time he arrived in England, he was quite a figure,"" said Breese.

""(If) you look at almost any description of Hutch, he's always the best dressed man in the room, he's always the best looking, he has impeccable manners, he's riding in Rotten Row,"" said Breese, referring to a track around Hyde Park where fashionable upper-class Londoners would meet on horseback.

Hutchinson believed the affluent people with whom he was mixing finally ""would recognize him as a human being, as a person, as a friend. And indeed, unlike most performers of any kind, they did, which was a very unexpected thing,"" said Breese.

She believes Hutchinson was ""the first Black man they ever really got to know well. And that was a hugely important thing and very much thanks to Hutch taking the time and effort to get to know White people well.""

But Hutch's untroubled acceptance into fashionable circles was not to last.

When The People, a Sunday newspaper, published a story strongly hinting that a certain aristocrat had a Black lover and had been forced to leave the country to allow the scandal to subside, the royal family reportedly ordered the Mountbattens to sue for libel.

The paper had alleged ""a scandal which has shaken society to the very depths. It concerns one of the leading hostesses in the country -- a woman highly connected and immensely rich. Her associations with a coloured man became so marked that they were the talk of the West End. Then one day the couple were caught in compromising circumstances.""

It was well-known in high-society circles that Edwina and her naval officer husband, a cousin of the Prince of Wales, had an open marriage, said Evans, the playwright. But Mountbatten's royal connections meant any public knowledge of her affair with a Black man would be unacceptable to Buckingham Palace.

After a closed-door hearing, the libel case was settled in the Mountbattens' favor in July 1932. The People gave an apology in court and Lady Louis Mountbatten, as she was known, declined to seek damages for what her lawyer described as a ""loathsome allegation.""

While the scandal didn't end Hutchinson's career -- he continued to perform, and all-told recorded about 400 songs, including hits like ""These Foolish Things,"" ""Night and Day,"" ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" and 'Begin the Beguine"" -- it did close some doors to him. Press baron Lord Beaverbrook would not allow the singer's name in his newspapers, and he was not invited to perform at the Royal Variety Show.

But this was not the first time Hutch had been treated as an outsider; he was already experienced in navigating a prejudiced society.

""Racism was rife and he had to fight against that all the time. One of the themes of his life was that he had been invited to all these high society parties to perform but still had to use the back door,"" in the same way as a servant would, said Evans. ""But at the same time, he adopted a fairly 'White' way of life, he had perfect RP (received pronunciation) in the way he spoke, he spent most of his life trying to slot in.""

Breese said Hutchinson was not even allowed on the stage to play piano when he first arrived in Britain, because he was Black, but over time broke down that barrier, and others.

She cites an interview Hutch gave in the 1950s in which he said being asked to enter through the servants' entrance had been irritating -- but that often after becoming friends with the hosts he was invited through the front door, and ""counted that as something of a success.""

Best paid entertainer in Europe

Having been a huge hit in the 1920s and early 30s with the well-heeled cabaret crowd, who would enjoy dinner and a live show in late-night restaurants and intimate nightclubs, Hutchinson later won over the variety crowd, performing on stage to mass audiences, said Breese.

""Very often he was the first Black man that particularly the working-class variety audiences had seen and, initially, he was booed off the stage at Chatham in Kent, so he came a long way from there to being the best paid entertainer in Europe for 20 years,"" she said.

This was a huge achievement and demonstrated Hutchinson's courage in the face of obstacles, Breese said. During World War II he would also lead large crowds in patriotic singalongs, despite his own great fear of the bombing raids, she added.

By the end of the war, when Hutchinson was drinking heavily and was concerned that his career was over, said Breese, he moved back to New York, but he found his ties to England ran too deep and quickly returned.

His return led to a big comeback, said the biographer. ""Once again he had royal patronage, of all kinds really, from Prince Philip and Princess Alexandra, Princess Margaret, the Queen Mum -- all of them used to turn up at (the Mayfair restaurant) Quaglino's. And he continued to have a huge TV and radio presence.""

He also traveled widely in the 1950s, including visits to Britain's former colonies -- Australia, South Africa, Kenya and Singapore -- where he was still a big name, said Breese.

But long hours combined with heavy drinking and smoking gradually led to the decline of his health. In 1969, at age 69, Hutchinson died almost penniless, having fallen into debt. In an odd twist, Lord Mountbatten paid for the cost of his funeral.

For a generation or two, Hutch's name was known to almost anyone you asked, said Breese. But, with the passing of time, he has faded from the nation's memory.

Inspiring a new generation

When a documentary film about Hutchinson, titled ""Hutch: High Society's Favourite Gigolo,"" was broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 2008, it highlighted his sexual relationships as much as his musical talent. For some, it was uncomfortable viewing.

""I remember I was with a group of older-generation Grenadians, men, it was before it was shown and they were really excited that there was this documentary about a Black, Grenadian musician -- because you know, we can get generalized very much, as just being from the Caribbean or just being Black, it's all just under one umbrella,"" said singer ALA.NI.

""After they watched it, because it was disclosing his sexuality and his antics, let's say, they were not happy, saying 'we don't want this man representing us.'""

Being from a different generation, and having a different perspective on Hutch's bisexuality, ALA.NI said she had a different response to the film's revelations. ""When I saw that I thought, wow, he was up against so much, from his own culture, from the opposite side too, and we are just in such a different time.""

Instead, the dashing great-great-uncle who died before she was born is now a touchstone for her, and, she hopes, may inspire other young Black musicians too.

The footage that exists him of performing at the piano is, even today, an unusual representation of a Black man, ALA.NI said. ""To see him with his tailcoat, with the handkerchief, looking graceful, so well poised, playing well, singing beautifully, is very inspirational and important for us.""

Since the film aired, Hutchinson's contribution to Britain's music history as one of its first popular Black entertainers has won wider recognition.

In 2012, as part of a scheme to celebrate notable figures and the buildings connected to them, charity English Heritage placed a blue plaque on the house in which he lived for nearly 40 years with his wife, Ella, and their daughter, Lesley.

In 2013, Hutch's affair with Edwina Mountbatten also appeared to inspire a storyline on period drama ""Downton Abbey,"" in which Lady Rose becomes involved with a handsome Black musician, Jack Ross.

And a plaque at Quaglino's now pays tribute to his late-night performances there from the 1930s to the 1960s.

For ALA.NI, the blue plaque ceremony -- attended by actor Stephen Fry and numerous relatives of Hutch, including his late son Chris Hutchinson and daughter Gabrielle Markes -- was a powerful affirmation of his legacy and of her own potential as an artist.

""It was, like, wow, this man did something, he's our family and he did something so brave and out there and so against the grain of everything at that time. What am I waiting for? I have to be as brave as he was,"" ALA.NI said."

One of photographer Luke Gilford's earliest memories is of his father bringing him to the rodeo. The native Coloradan recalls a bold, colorful world of Stetson hats and snakeskin shoes, of barbecued meat and majestic horses.

""It's something that I really adored as a child. It's quite a sensory experience with the pastel sunsets and the line dancing and hairspray and sequins. It's quite a thing,"" Gilford said over the phone from New York where is he currently based. ""I really loved that culture.""

But while the rodeo circuit he loved was associated with showmanship and extravagance, it was also dominated by a culture of frontier masculinity -- a sense of rugged individualism that can be hostile to anything outside itself. And as Gilford grew older, he began to understand that the sport was rife with homophobia. Gilford identifies as queer, and he found himself leaving the scene behind.

""I love the land of the Southwest and I love the animals and I love a lot of aspects of the culture,"" he said. ""But the homophobia really turned me away.""

Then, in 2016, Gilford discovered there was a multifaceted, multicultural world of LGBTQ+ rodeo -- one that existed in his home state in the form of a local branch of the International Gay Rodeo Association (IGRA).

Gilford was attending a Pride event in northern California when he first came across members of the IGRA. ""I could tell that they were authentic cowboys and cowgirls just because I'm from Colorado. I know one when I see one,"" he said. ""I was so shocked to see them at a Pride event. I went up and talked to them and they were so warm and so welcoming, and they encouraged me to come check it out.""

Co-opting the rodeo

From that chance encounter, Gilford went on to spend years immersed in the queer rodeo scene -- a scene that officially kicked off in 1976 when the first gay rodeo was held in Nevada before branching out into state-based rodeo associations that unified under the IGRA name in 1985. The resulting images -- published in the recent photo book ""National Anthem: America's Queer Rodeo"" -- are a testament to a marginalized community that reappropriates a predominantly rural narrative often used to exclude it.

In one striking image, the elegant Priscilla Toya Bouvier -- who was Miss IGRA 2019 -- proudly displays a towering, bejeweled crown atop her coiffed locks and a winner's sash across her crisp, peach-colored shirt. In one sense, the photo recalls the traditional image of a rodeo queen -- the glamorous, official faces of mainstream rodeos, who are often photographed sporting ornate crowns and sashes. But here, Gilford presents a more inclusive and expansive definition of who can represent the western American pastime.

Likewise, in another portrait, three rodeo participants bedecked in classic rodeo attire stand with their backs to Gilford's lens, embracing. The moment of gentle companionship calls into question traditional ideas of masculinity and long-held beliefs about how so-called cowboys should behave around one another. In a further photo, a cohort of enthusiasts mingle on horseshoe-imprinted arena sand -- the subtly powerful image suggesting that they feel at home in a space that usually snubs the queer community.

""It's interesting because the arenas where the queer rodeos take place are where the mainstream rodeos take place. We're quite literally borrowing queer space and time in places that were not built for or by us,"" Gilford added. ""There's a subversion of power there, even if only for a weekend, to be co-opting this space and making it our own.""

Challenging binaries

Indeed, while some of Gilford's portraits toy with the norms of conventional rodeo -- it is unlikely that his photo of two naked participants on horseback would emerge from a mainstream rodeo, for example -- these images don't exist to merely poke fun. Instead, Gilford's portraiture reveals a cohort of passionate amateurs whose interests challenge cultural stereotypes that associate the LGBTQ+ community with all things metropolitan.

Drew Sawyer, an art historian and curator at the Brooklyn Museum, and author of a forward to ""National Anthem,"" explained over an audio conference call that Gilford's work questions a long-held assumption that LGBTQ+ people must gravitate towards cities ""for their own freedom and safety, but also a larger sense of community.""

Sawyer places Gilford's work firmly in the lineage of East Coast city-based photographers Peter Hujar and Nan Goldin -- photographers who were famous for their intimate portraiture of LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalized groups and for being part of those same communities. But Sawyer does so with one qualification: ""Historically, that hasn't been the case for people outside of metropolitan centers,"" he added.

In this sense, Gilford's work could be said to complicate the binary of red states and blue states, which are often simplified and stereotyped in public discourse.

""There's these tribal dichotomies in America that cannot contain who we really are. There's the red and blue states. There's the coastal elites versus middle America and there's the conservatives versus the liberals. It's just so binary and polarizing,"" Gilford said. ""What's so beautiful about this community is that they really embrace both ends of the American cultural spectrum -- and everything in between. It's what we would hope America would be in the first place."""
391,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/lyle-ashton-harris-ektachrome-archive/index.html,"A trove of old Ektachrome slides shows artists, friends and lovers in the 1980s and '90s","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

When Lyle Ashton Harris' grandfather passed away, he and his brother inherited a vast trove of over 10,000 Ektachrome slides documenting his day-to-day life. Developed in the early 1940s, the film is a brand name from Kodak, and was a new type of color technology when their grandfather adopted it. (Instead of adding color to black-and-white images during processing, as is done with Kodachrome, this film allowed people to take images directly in color.)

Four decades later, multimedia artist Harris began his own Ektachrome archive, in the 1980s and '90s as art and culture underwent seismic shifts, galvanized in part by a new wave of Black artists and critical thinkers, as well as LGBTQ artists grappling with the AIDS epidemic. Harris documented friends, lovers, idols and himself, as they moved through the linked creative and political circles that helped define this era.

""The late '80s, early '90s, was critical for collective community, whether that's the Black radical community, queer community, AIDS activism, etc.,"" Harris said via a video call. ""The archive ... speaks to the collective.""

Selections from Harris' ""Ektachrome Archive"" have been shown at major institutional shows, debuting at the São Paulo Biennial in 2016, followed by the Whitney Biennial the next year. Photos have been also been published in the 2017 book by Aperture, ""Today I Shall Judge Nothing That Occurs.""

Close friends and tender moments

Until recently, Harris didn't consider his archive as a singular body of work, but a simple -- though prolific -- act that accompanied his more formal series, such as his ""Shadow Works,"" mixed-media assemblages that also excavate memories. ""I was just documenting in the manner that my grandfather did -- or (photographer) Nan Goldin did -- just documenting friends and family events, places that I traveled,"" Harris said of his work.

Harris' archive includes a portrait of Nigerian photographer and friend Iké Udé in front of a vanity mirror in 1995, gazing to the side. It also includes tender moments of late filmmaker Marlon Riggs, who died in 1994 from AIDS complications, and who Harris met as a graduate student at the California Institute of the Arts. In one photograph from New York in the early '90s, author and activist bell hooks, real name Gloria Watkins, wraps her arm around Riggs as they share a laugh, their faces close. In another, Riggs sits in the backseat of a car with his mother and grandmother, on the night that he was honored for becoming the youngest tenured professor ever at the University of California, Berkeley, in the last months of his life.

When it comes to the deaths of gay men or those with HIV, ""There is a narrative that still lingers today ... in the African American community,"" Harris said, ""that is shrouded in shame.""

The photograph is a testimony ""that there was a mother as well as a grandmother that ... was able to bear witness to their son who is in advanced stages of his life, in his mid 30s,"" Harris said, ""and to also simultaneously witness his celebration.""

A cultural shift

In 2000 Harris left the United States and moved to Rome, then eventually Ghana in 2005 to teach for New York University. He didn't return stateside until 2012. All the while, his bags of Ektachrome slides remained in his mother's home in the Bronx; he didn't revisit them until he moved back to New York, looking for renewal following life changes including the ending of a relationship.

His friend, the artist Isaac Julien, was preparing a catalog to accompany his ""Ten Thousand Waves"" film installation at the Museum of Modern Art, and in 2013 asked Harris to sift through his photographs for images of '90s London.

""I had not actually seen (the slides) in over a decade,"" Harris said, who noted he was just documenting for ""close to 20 years before I began to think of it as a body of work or an archive.

""The slides in a way reconnect me with the punk energy of New York... seeing a younger side of myself depicted in the slides,"" he reflected, ""recapture that.""

That younger self, when he was starting out, used his camera to develop a sense of confidence as he navigated important cultural events attended by the likes of activist Angela Davis and social critic Cornel West.

With camera in hand, the young Harris captured key figures of the zeitgeist at the ""Black Popular Culture"" conference in 1991 and, just out of graduate school, documented 1995's ""Black Nations/Queer Nations?"" a conference about gay and lesbian identities in the African diaspora. ""The camera became a way in which I could negotiate space or ... could actually hold my own, and it's interesting now to have become the elder, and 20 years later, the younger generation is looking for meaning from these images.""

At the ""Black Popular Culture"" conference, which took place at the Dia Center for the Arts in New York's SoHo neighborhood, Harris snapped a portrait of artist Ringgold, art critic Douglas Crimp, author Crystal Britton and literary agent Faith Childs sitting in the audience. Harris said he couldn't overstate the importance of these forums in positioning ""Black popular culture as a sphere of influence.""

Moreover, it was ""the first time in culture history, where you had two trajectories overlap and come together"" -- black popular culture and ""its theoretical and artistic legacy,"" he said. This shift, according to Harris, had a profound influence not only on Black culture, but also the wider contemporary culture and political theory.

Collective community

Harris emphasizes the collective community that formed around these pivotal moments -- and sees a connection to the anti-racist movements happening today. When graffiti artist Michael Stewart was killed by the New York City Transit Police in 1983 for tagging a station wall, he pointed out, artists from various backgrounds and disciplines responded, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Lou Reed and Madonna.

""If you think about Black Lives Matter today,"" he said, ""it was birthed by three Afro-American women (two of whom identify as queer) who had had enough, but now it has become the pulse of a young generation -- a wider generation -- that is multiethnic, fluid in terms of sexualities (and) identities.""

The archive, according to Harris, serves as a bridge to the dynamic movements of past decades.

Harris credits members of the ""young generation"" for what he sees as real efforts in trying to reimagine how they can do collective building. ""People are looking at more activism,"" he said. ""The archive offers them a momentary resting point where they could actually reflect that they're not alone -- the fact (there) were people and movements before. I think that's a very reassuring thing."""

Summer is Min Hyunwoo's favorite time of the year. For the 32-year-old South Korean photographer, it's a period reminiscent of his childhood -- an opportunity to relive vivid memories and create new, long-lasting ones.

""Summer is so short and fleeting,"" the photographer said. ""We have to wait so long to experience it again yet it's interesting because it seems like we remember memories made in the summer forever.""

Based in Seoul, Min is a fashion photographer whose images feature models draped in colorful garments, and posing in playful ways. His work has appeared in Highsnobriety and Nylon Japan.

In Min's latest series, ""We Are Going to Live This Summer,"" young men and women play in a large lake, submerging themselves at varying depths. Capturing subjects splashing, dragging their bodies through the water or playing with giant lotus leaves and lavender buds, the photographs demonstrate the subtle tenderness of youth.

Below, Min discusses how he uses the afternoon sun and moving water to convey emotion.

CNN: What inspired your latest series? Aesthetically, what were you trying to achieve?

Min Hyunwoo: I was very sick, emotionally, in the summer of 2018, so it felt like it had never happened. When 2019 came along, I wanted to keep hold of that summer.

I often think that we have a lot of time but there never seems to be enough. I was very upset about having had a meaningless summer, so this series is an apology for that.

Why did you choose water as a backdrop?

I was born in South Korea and grew up in a seaside village in Gangwon province. I learned very early on to play in nature and am good at spending time outside.

As a child, I enjoyed sitting by the water. It's something I still like to do to this day. When l watch flowing water, I feel a sense of resolution. On the other hand, I don't enjoy going into the water because I can feel my temperature drop very quickly. I also can't swim. I wanted to explore this dichotomy in my work.

When I stare at water for a while, I sometimes start to think that it has feelings (of its own).

""I would tell them to open their eyes in a more calm or subtle way, or to slowly move from left to right,"" said the photographer. Credit: Min Hyunwoo

Min Hyunwoo

What time of day was best for shooting the photos?

I waited until sunset hours. South Korea's sunsets don't last as long as the ones in Europe though, so I try to make the most of that short amount of time. I think I prefer soft but sharp lighting.

I try to take advantage of the situation, even if it rains. The waves would change depending on the weather. It seems like human emotions also change depending on the shape of the water.

According to Min, the ripples in the water are meant to encapsulate human emotion. Credit: Min Hyunwoo

Who are the people in your photographs? Did you give them much direction?

They are my friends. I have a lot of model friends, but I want to capture people with more of an ordinary look.

I usually asked them to play in the water and feel comfortable. Having a conversation beforehand is one way of doing that.

Sometimes I would tell them to open their eyes in a more calm or subtle way, or to slowly move from left to right. I think it's important to (be in constant communication) with them to help them focus.

What's the biggest difference between your art projects and your commercial work?

I think its meaningless to distinguish between between art and commercial photography. There's a difference between doing something that you like to do and something that you have to do. But in my mind, there's not much difference when it's all my work.

Over the past few years, a number of young Black photographers have made their mark on the art world, and critic, writer and curator Antwaun Sargent has made it his mission to cement their legacies.

In 2019, Sargent's ""The New Black Vanguard,"" was published by Aperture Foundation. The book, alongside an accompanying exhibition, presented 15 rising photographers working in fashion and art, who, through their works, ""challenge the idea that Blackness is homogenous,"" according to the foundation. The featured artists included Tyler Mitchell, Ruth Ossai and Daniel Obasi

Now Sargent has built upon this work with ""Just Pictures,"" an exhibition that extends his interest in images that cross genres, from the pages of fashion magazines to the white walls of galleries.

Here, Sargent discusses his new exhibition and how this generation of Black photographers are making history and shifting cultural conversations.

CNN Style: Tell me how the ""Just Pictures"" exhibition came to be.

Antwaun Sargent: The exhibition has grown out of the work I've been doing over the last couple of years. One of those projects is ""The New Black Vanguard,"" and in researching that project, I really started to think about how these photographers are interested in the boundary-blurring potential of their images -- the way that these images circulate in museums, in galleries, in magazines, on social media, makes them borderless -- and how the meaning of their images change with each setting that they're in.

""There is a diversity of perspectives and geographies,"" in the show, Sargent said. Pictured is the work of Morrocan-Belgian photographer Mous Lamrabat. Credit: Mous Lamrabat

I wanted to give space to the liminal eye of the young photographer working today. In ""Just Pictures,"" you have that with these eight photographers who might share conceptual themes, but the way that they are expressed is totally different. They're images that have a great diversity to them. And it really shows the emerging aesthetic of some of this generation's leading photographers.

The title, ""Just Pictures,"" is a reflection of the spirit in which these images are shot. These image-makers are not saying they are shooting fashion images or art images; they're just shooting the images that they want to see in the world. For me, ""Just Pictures"" captures the infinite possibility of these images.

CNN Style: Why have you made rising Black photographers one of the focuses of your work?

Sargent: Frankly, it's just one of the most exciting things happening in art today. We've had an explosion of young image-makers -- particularly across the African diaspora -- who are really rethinking photography every day.

Every month, we get a new cover or new image from a young Black photographer that really sets the cultural conversation. Take Viola Davis on the cover of Vanity Fair (photographed by Dario Calmese) the other month. It sparked a debate about the representation of darker-skinned women on the cover of fashion magazines.

You have these moments in art and photography where the conversation becomes more fluid. This moment is largely being driven by the work of young Black photographers, not just in America, but across the African diaspora. The image-makers in ""Just Pictures"" come from all different places.

You have (Ghanian American) Joshua Kissi from New York; Renell Medrano, whose family is from the Dominican Republic; Ruth (Ossai) whose family is from Nigeria and Mous (Lamrabat) whose family is from North Africa. There is a diversity of perspectives and geographies.

""These image-makers are really rooted in a history of Black photography,"" Sargent said. ""But they're also using that history to define their own aesthetics."" Credit: Joshua Kissi

CNN Style: What are some of the traditions that these photographers are bringing a new perspective to that you find particularly exciting?

Sargent: Ruth Ossai is expanding the possibilities of studio portraiture with an eye to some of the great 20th-century African post-independence photographers like Malick Sidibé. You have Arielle Bobb-Willis, whose practice comes out of 20th-century African American painting. She notes Jacob Lawrence as an influence for his use of color and the ways in which his figures are abstracted.

Joshua Kissi's focus on how to properly light black skin goes back to the history of the Kodak ""Shirley card,"" in which photo labs calibrated skin tones in prints based on white skin.

Justin Solomon captures images through a process of experimentation. He's making images of the silhouettes of Black men through this process where he's shooting these images rapidly. Yagazie Emezi's images are cinematic and fall in the intersection of film and photography.

These image-makers are really rooted in a history of Black photography. But they're also using that history to define their own aesthetics.

CNN Style: You were very vocal about the canceled ""See in Black"" show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and how those Black artists were taken advantage of when their work was acquired through a $100 charity print sale. What do you think needs to change in the art world to protect young Black photographers?

Sargent: They need to be included more properly in the gallery and museum system. Young photographers also need to take steps to protect themselves. When their work leaves the studio, they need to make sure that it's going to people who really love the work, who are going to want to live with that work, not someone who is sort of interested in collecting art for monetary value.

The Whitney show is not the first time that a Black artist has done something in the name of charity and had their work misused. Kerry James Marshall put up a work for auction to support the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and it sold for, I think, half a million dollars, and then it was flipped for several million dollars, by the person who bought it. (Editor's note: The painting sold for $750,000 in 2015 and was flipped in 2017 for over $5 million.)

Young artists should know the market, but we need to hold institutions and collectors to standards that are fair and equitable. The Whitney didn't engage the artists at all in the process for collecting and exhibiting the works, which is atypical.

CNN Style: Do you think emerging photographers face fewer barriers entering the art world today?

Sargent: I don't know if there are fewer barriers. We can't confuse visibility with actual institutional and financial support. So I think what's happening right now if there is a lot of visibility -- a lot of artists showing their work on magazine covers. But I still have yet to see a real institutional and gallery push that ensures that these artists are financially supported and are entering the canon of art through collections.

We need to make sure that generations from now, that their work will be preserved in archives and available for scholars and curators and the public. Hopefully some of the works from this show can be preserved and collected by people who have a vested interest in making sure that this is not just a moment, but a shift in the ways in which we look at photography and the ways in which we look at the artistic production of the Black artist.

394,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/lumbee-pageant-natalie-keyssar-photography/index.html,Inside a small-town Native American beauty pageant,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

Each year, pageants like Miss Native American and Miss Indian World invite indigenous women from around the United States to represent historically disenfranchised tribes and celebrate their cultural heritage.

And in the rural town of Pembroke, North Carolina, which sits along the state's southern border, a much smaller annual pageant takes place: one honoring the girls and women of a tribe that has fought for federal recognition for over 130 years.

The Lumbee Homecoming is a week-long summer event hosted by the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, and includes competitions for Miss Lumbee, Teen Miss Lumbee, Junior Miss Lumbee, Little Miss Lumbee and Senior Ms. Lumbee, as well as a veteran's ball, pow wow and parade.

This year's Homecoming, originally set to begin in late June, was canceled for the first time in its five-decade history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But in 2018, Brooklyn-based photographer Natalie Keyssar, who grew up two hours away in Durham, traveled to Pembroke to document the festivities.

The pageant is ""a celebration of Lumbee beauty and ... the empowered Lumbee woman,"" Keyssar said over a video call. ""It's this joy in identity ... it's this reverence for the strong women in their community.""

Asserting their identity

Homecoming is a chance for the 55,000-strong Lumbee community to come together and take pride in its heritage. The women recognized in the Lumbee pageants become ambassadors for the year ahead, representing the tribe at various events to help educate people about its history and cultural practices.

The Lumbee tribe website says it is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River, yet it is only recognized at the state level. In 1956, Congress passed the Lumbee Act, acknowledging the Lumbee as a Native American tribe but denying it the right to self-govern or receive federal funding.

Earlier this month, however, a committee in the US House of Representatives approved bipartisan legislation that would grant the tribe its long sought-after status, allowing the bill to move forward to the House floor. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden recently said he would back federal recognition of the Lumbee, which tends to be a ""swing tribe"" at the ballot box.

The Lumbee have a unique history. The tribe's faith is primarily Baptist and its members descend from several Native American tribes, including the Cheraw, that intermarried with Whites and free African Americans in the 18th and 19th centuries. Though the Lumbee lost their ancestral language through colonization, today they speak the Lumbee English dialect.

""There's a pretty incredible rebellious, revolutionary history of the Lumbee,"" Keyssar said, pointing to events in 1958, when the tribe famously drove away a Klu Klux Klan rally in the so-called Battle of Hayes Pond. The homecoming is a ""cultural celebration that is so relevant to the history of the South,"" the photographer added. ""And it's revolutionary and anti-racist in nature.""

The pageant shows the tribe's ""profound fusion of Southern culture,"" Keyssar said. Participants are scored across several events, including a talent portion, during which contestants often sing gospel songs. They change outfits between segments, switching from evening gowns to colorful long-sleeve traditional dresses that honor and reclaim their history.

Community pride

At each of the week's pageants, Keyssar took portraits on stage and behind the scenes, as contestants prepared for their entrances and previous ambassadors returned to pass their crowns to new honorees. Friends and family often stayed with contestants to help with their hair and makeup, Keyssar said.

""The poise and performative power of these young women completely blew me away,"" the photographer said. (Though, she added, the anxiety of the younger contestants contrasted starkly with the cool and collected Ms. Senior Lumbee hopefuls, who have sometimes been participating for decades.)

In one of her most striking images, Keyssar captured a contestant, Kerighan, moments after she claimed the title of Miss Teen Lumbee. When Kerighan won, the emotion was palpable, Keyssar recalled.

""The moment that Kerighan won ... was pretty powerful,"" Keyssar said. ""(The contestants) are playing these incredibly polished roles throughout the competition. And then she's a teenage girl and she's crying (and) smiling ... but trembling visibly.""

Current and former ambassadors then come together for a parade, waving to the crowds from floats and cars that drive through the town. Keyssar said it's a time of joy in a community that has long faced adversity, from high poverty rates to historic flooding.

""(It's) not a place where life is particularly easy,"" she noted. But during Homecoming ""there's just so much pride coming down the street. There are so many (pageant) queens and everybody's so excited.

""It's pretty magical,"" she added.

395,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/forbidden-city-china-architecture-600-years/index.html,Forbidden City at 600: How China's imperial palace survived against the odds,"When the American writer David Kidd arrived in Beijing in 1981, having not seen China's capital for three decades, he found the city almost unrecognizable.

The fabled city walls were gone; its temples turned into schools and factories. Only in the vast imperial palace complex of the Forbidden City ""could I imagine that the city surrounding it was unchanged,"" Kidd wrote in his memoir ""Peking Story."" It created the illusion, he added, ""of supernatural space and time.""

The Forbidden City, which turns 600 this year, was carefully designed to conjure such an illusion.

It is the world's largest palace complex, covering more than 7.75 million square feet (720,000 square meters) and separated from the rest of Beijing by a 171-foot-wide (52 meters) moat and a 33-foot-high (10 meters) wall, with gate towers guarding its entrances. The fortress-like design was intended to protect the emperor, but also to emphasize his pre-eminence: The emperor was, after all, heaven's representative on Earth and, in its scale, majesty and separateness, his palace was built to ensure that neither his subjects, nor foreign visitors, ever forgot that.

Despite its monumental scale and central importance in Chinese history, however, the Forbidden City's continuing presence at the heart of the country's capital has been a story of survival against the odds. Fires, wars and power struggles have all threatened the imperial complex during the last six centuries.

Even as recently as the mid-20th century, the fate of the Forbidden City looked far from secure. After taking control of China in 1949, the country's communist rulers engaged in fierce debate over this vast area at the center of Beijing. Twenty-four emperors had taken the throne there over the course of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the palace's history and design made it an obvious symbol of the iniquities of feudal rule that the Chinese Communist Party had railed against, and an obstacle to its vision of a new socialist capital.

Yet the Forbidden City survived waves of drastic alterations made to Beijing's architectural layout in the 1950s and 60s, in spite of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong's disdain for old buildings and other remnants of China's imperial past -- as well as suggestions by others in the leadership that the palace should be turned into central government offices.

In these first decades of communist rule, Beijing's centuries-old walls were pulled down to build an underground subway system, while historic ministries and imperial archives (in front of Tiananmen, or the ""Gate of Heavenly Peace,"" just to the south of the Forbidden City) were razed to lay a vast granite square. Between the square and the gate, old archways were torn down, and a broad highway was built in their place.

There is no single reason why the Forbidden City escaped this period of razing and rebuilding, though the cost of redeveloping such a sizable area, combined with the absence of a coherent plan for what would replace it, both played a role. But it was just the latest chapter in an unlikely tale of survival.

Ancient design principles

The Forbidden City is, today, synonymous with Beijing, but its story actually begins in a city almost 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) to its south: Nanjing. (""Jing"" in Mandarin means ""capital,"" with Beijing translating as ""northern capital"" and Nanjing as ""southern capital."") In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming dynasty, designated Nanjing -- a city on the Yangtze river, in the economic heartland of China -- as the national capital, building a palace complex, ringed by a vast city wall, from which to rule.

It appeared that Nanjing would remain China's capital for as long as the Ming were in charge, and when Zhu Yuanzhang died, his grandson and chosen successor continued to rule from the city. However, one of Zhu Yuanzhang's sons, Zhu Di, who established a power base in Beijing, had other ideas. In the summer of 1402, after a three-year conflict between Zhu Di and the emperor, the imperial palace in Nanjing was razed by fire, apparently killing the emperor and his family. Zhu Di claimed the throne for himself, becoming known as the Yongle Emperor and establishing Beijing as the national capital.

There he built an imperial palace to dwarf that of his predecessor to the south. The Forbidden City, as it would later become known, was completed in 1420, and required a workforce of hundreds of thousands, using materials from across the country: precious timber from Sichuan in China's far southwest; fine gold leaf from Suzhou, near Shanghai; clay bricks from Shandong to the east. Though the marble came from a quarry only 31 miles (50 kilometers) west of Beijing, some of the largest pieces were so heavy that they could only be transported during the winter, when water was poured onto the road to create an icy surface across which the stone could slide -- when pulled by a team of thousands.

The Forbidden City's original architects drew design principles from the second-century B.C. text, the ""Rites of Zhou,"" which had long informed ancient Chinese urban planning. Symmetry was crucial, with a city's boundaries marked by a square wall. The text decreed that roads, starting from gates built into these walls, were to run east to west and north to south across the city. At the very center of the complex, protected by yet another wall, should sit the ruler's palace.

Looking at maps of the square, walled inner-city of old Beijing, with the palace at its center, the influence of these ancient principles upon the Yongle Emperor's architects are obvious.

Even the Forbidden City's smallest design details are rich in symbolism, from its golden yellow tiles -- a color linking the emperor to the sun -- to the ceramic animals that line the corners of the palace roofs. The dragon stands for the emperor and the power invested in him, the phoenix signifies virtue and the seahorse brings good fortune. The palace walls and supporting columns were washed with red clay from Shandong province; again, a color associated with the emperor, who wrote his edicts in red ink.

Though emperors of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) added some new buildings and gardens, the layout of the palace has remained fundamentally the same since it was completed in 1420. Yet, as soon as construction finished, the Forbidden City was threatened by what would become a perpetual nemesis: fire.

The palace buildings, primarily made of wood, were vulnerable to lightning strikes, the open flames used for lighting and heating, and even pyrotechnic displays. To combat the risk of fire, hundreds of metal vats were placed around the palace to collect water (they were heated with small fires during the winter to stop the water freezing) and early lightning conductors were built onto higher roofs.

Still, there were regular fires, as well as earthquakes, over the centuries. As a result, almost all of the buildings of the Forbidden City are later reconstructions of the originals -- the Hall of Supreme Harmony, for instance, has been rebuilt seven times since its first construction.

Decades of conflict

Conflict has also posed a regular threat to the Forbidden City. In 1644, most of the palace was destroyed at the hands of rebel leader Li Zicheng. After the Ming dynasty fell, Li occupied the city for 42 days, until he was forced out by the Manchu forces who would establish the next ruling dynasty, the Qing. As he left, his troops set fire to the palace compound, destroying most of its buildings. It would take decades for the Qing to finish the reconstruction work.

Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, a series of domestic uprisings and foreign conflicts also threatened the Forbidden City, as the Qing began to lose their grip on the country. These culminated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, and the most serious infringement to the sanctity of the Forbidden City in over 250 years.

The Boxers were an anti-foreign, anti-Christian sect who besieged Beijing's foreign community for 55 days that summer. When international troops arrived to relieve the beleaguered international residents, the ruling Empress Dowager, who had supported the Boxers, fled with her court to Xi'an, more than 500 miles to Beijing's southwest, leaving the palace empty. Its buildings had already been damaged by shelling, and some in the foreign community questioned whether it might be a good idea to burn the palace down altogether.

Instead, in the absence of the imperial family, the diplomatic corps and the soldiers who had saved them took the opportunity to explore the sacred interior (the ""Da Nei,"" or Great Within, as it was known) of the resting court: an unprecedented infringement. Some were not above stealing the valuables left behind in the Empress' hurry to escape. The court would return, chastened, in 1902 and the Qing dynasty limped on for another decade.

Though the last emperor, Puyi, abdicated in 1912, bringing to an end imperial rule in China, he would remain a resident in the Forbidden City's resting court for another 12 years, an emperor in name only, whose authority reached only to the walls and gates of his living quarters. China's new republican government meanwhile established itself in the lake palaces to the west, a complex known as Zhongnanhai, which is still home to today's Communist Party leadership.

Conflict continued to pose a threat to the buildings of the imperial palace -- and the treasures contained within. In 1917, in response to an attempt to restore Puyi as emperor, republican planes dropped bombs onto the palace during the first air raid in China's history. Little damage was done, at least according to an account by one British diplomat, who wrote that the only casualties were some goldfish in a pool and a nearby eunuch who was injured in the blasts.

After Puyi was evicted by a warlord who took control of Beijing in 1924, the next phase of the palace's storied history began. In 1925, it fully opened as a public museum (prior to that, only a small area of the palace had been open to visitors, who were not allowed access to the resting court).

Only six years after the Palace Museum opened, however, the threat posed by Japan's invasion of Manchuria, to the north of Beijing, meant that many of the Forbidden City's most valuable treasures had to be removed from the capital. The story of their travels across China, as the ruling Nationalist government searched for safe harbor, is long and tumultuous. In 1948, however, as the Nationalists faced down the prospect of losing the civil war against Mao Zedong's Communist forces, they shipped over 600,000 of the finest palace treasures to Taiwan, where they remain to this day.

Into the modern age

During the years of Chinese Communist Party rule that followed, threats to the palace came not only from the capital's aforementioned architectural changes but also the ideological extremism of the Cultural Revolution.

In August of 1966, the first of a series of mass rallies designed to encourage China's youth to rebel against what Mao termed the ""four olds"" (old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas) was held in Tiananmen Square, just to the south of the Forbidden City. The palace, hidden behind Tiananmen -- which the million-plus students directly faced -- seemed to embody the ancient values they were being encouraged to attack. The rallying students began agitating to enter the palace, intent on destruction.

Premier Zhou Enlai, hearing of the threat, issued a directive closing the Forbidden City that night, and sent soldiers to protect it. On returning to find the heavy wooden gates of the palace shut, the Red Guards erected signs reading ""Palace of Blood and Tears,"" ""Burn the Forbidden City to the Ground"" and ""Trample the Old Palace."" Zhou kept the Forbidden City closed for the next five years, eventually dispatching a garrison of soldiers to live there, such were the constant threats.

The palace would finally reopen in 1971 for the visit of the US table tennis team, whose arrival in Beijing marked the tentative beginnings of a new era in US-China relations in what became known as ""ping-pong diplomacy.""

The main threat to the palace today is not fire or conflict, but simple age, coupled with the footfall of millions of visitors who tour the site each year. Palace Museum authorities are faced with ongoing questions about how to best preserve and present the site.

Any ambivalence once felt by China's communist rulers towards the Forbidden City has now been replaced by an eagerness to emphasize China's cultural heritage. In a 2014 speech to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which declared the Palace Museum a World Heritage Site in 1987, President Xi Jinping commented that, ""A civilization carries on its back the soul of a country or nation. It needs to be passed on from one generation to the next (...) We need to bring all collections in our museums, all heritage structures across our lands and all records in our classics to life.""

Though some renovations can be traced back to preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, changes to the Palace Museum have gathered pace since Xi's ascendancy, particularly as the palace's 600th birthday approached. Previously-closed-off areas of the museum have reopened, and visitors can now also walk on top of much of the palace wall. The total open area in the Forbidden City is now up to 80% , compared to only 52% in 2014, with plans to increase to 85% by 2025.

While the palace buildings tended to be sparsely furnished, there has, recently, ""been an attempt to recreate the material culture of the spaces,"" said Jeremiah Jenne, who leads history programs in Beijing and has written extensively on the Forbidden City, referring to renovations that have seen the halls furnished with period decorations. ""For international visitors in particular, this helps them to envisage what these spaces might have looked like when they were actually in use,"" he said in an interview.

Questions of authenticity

The challenge of preserving and enhancing the historical integrity of the Forbidden City has seen some of the site's more modern buildings demolished in pursuit of imperial ""authenticity"" (a notion that is not without dispute). For those structures that remain, restoration efforts have emphasized traditional construction methods, while incorporating modern fire and earthquake protection.

""Replacing the cracked glazed tiles or refurbishing the eroded plastered columns with new materials prepared in the traditional methods, is widely accepted and practiced,"" said Matthew Hu, trustee of the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center, in an interview. ""In some ways, practicing and keeping alive this kind of craftsmanship is also a way of preserving the heritage."" The museum has also looked outside China for ""help from professional preservation institutions and foundations,"" added Hu, by drawing on assistance from international bodies like the World Monument Fund.

In deciding which period of history to evoke, the Palace Museum has tended to opt for the opulent 18th-century style of the Qing dynasty -- ""an imaginative moment,"" the scholar Geremie Barmé has written , ""that bespeaks China's last blossoming as a strong, prosperous and unified empire"" before the tumult of the 19th century.

Such choices relate to the wider challenge, identified by Jenne, of deciding ""what sort of museum it wants to be."" The Palace Museum holds over a million antiquities, including 367,000 pieces of porcelain and 53,000 paintings, and has staged an increasing number of exhibitions to showcase them. ""Does the Palace Museum want to be the Versailles or the Louvre?"" Jenne asked. ""Does it want to recreate the look and feel of the palace as it was in the Qing dynasty, say, or instead use the palace buildings as halls to display antiquities and treasures?""

The increasing number of exhibitions and events held at the Forbidden City all fit into an attempt to showcase its restored glories for a broader and younger demographic, perhaps further encouraging the ""cultural confidence"" Xi has spoken of. The Forbidden City's appeal to this group has been driven by its recent use as a setting for a range of high-profile television dramas (including the wildly popular ""Story of Yanxi Palace,"" streamed more than 18 billion times in 2018), documentaries and reality shows.

The Palace Museum's new director, Wang Xudong, has observed the importance of employing new technology to increase the landmark's profile within China. A recent partnership with Chinese technology giant Tencent to digitize palace treasures and offer immersive virtual reality experiences is part of this approach, as is the museum's use of social media. ""In this fast-developing digital era,"" Wang told Chinese state media in 2019, ""we need to fully connect technology and excellent traditional Chinese culture."" The strategy certainly seems to be working: Last year, visitor numbers exceeded 19 million , making the palace the most visited museum in the world -- with a majority of visitors under the age of 40.

Having endured six centuries of fire and conflict, natural disaster and periodic neglect, the Forbidden City has now been adopted by China's leaders as a proud symbol of the nation's history and culture, with money lavished on its restoration and preservation. Its future, for now at least, seems as secure as it has ever been.

The tiniest of runway shows was staged during Milan Fashion Week , and no models or guests were present.

Instead, Moschino's newest styles are sported by Jim Henson creations. But this isn't a bizarre Fraggle Rock crossover -- Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott has enlisted the help of Jim Henson's Creature Shop to create his Spring-Summer 2021 show on a miniature set populated entirely by marionettes.

As Fashion Month has continued in the wake of the ongoing pandemic , fashion designers have flexed their creative muscles through a mix of digital presentations and live, socially distanced shows in lieu of traditional runways. Scott opted for a -- literal -- scaled-down show with all models and attendees as puppets, with lookalikes of famous faces including Anna Wintour and British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful in the crowd.

""Not only did all the clothes have to be scaled down, and all the accessories scaled down (to) the size of the marionettes, but the whole audience had to be not only created and dressed,"" Scott said in a video interview with CNN Style.

It's a far cry from past presentations for the Italian label, which has become known for its kitschy luxury looks under the American designer's direction. Milan's last fashion week saw Moschino models walk down a chandelier-lit runway in Marie Antoinette-inspired mini pannier skirts and towering wigs to a clubby remix of Duran Duran's ""Girls on Film.""

For this Spring-Summer 2021 womenswear collection -- which will be available in human sizes -- Scott dialed down the drama with elegant dresses with oversized bows and tulle skirts, and dramatic collars and capes, in soft pinks and blues, pea green, gold and black. But there's also a narrative told through the garments' inverted details, with corset boning, seams and pocket interiors emphasized on the exterior of garments, and underskirts fanning out below the hemlines.

""As the world seems to be splitting along the seams, the bare inner workings of something new will be exposed,"" Scott said in a press release, referring to the impact of the pandemic on the world.

The creative director has his own lookalike in the show, wearing a crown and a Moschino t-shirt. ""As much as I loved working with the marionettes and as proud as I am of this show,"" he told CNN Style, ""I do miss working with real models and that energy and the energy of having a real audience and everyone gathered together. And I hope very soon I can do that in person again."""

Launching a fashion brand is hard. Launching a fashion brand during a global pandemic is near impossible.

For Teniola ""Tia"" Adeola, her debut on the New York Fashion Week show schedule took place a little over a month before the novel coronavirus took hold of the major fashion capitals and effectively brought the global fashion industry to its knees.

Adeola's show in February was an opportunity to present her newly established eponymous brand to the world. Her designs -- youthful, sexy, sheer and ruffled -- grabbed the attention of the fashion press and secured her ""one to watch"" status.

Anna Wintour and Adeola at a Teen Vogue Celebrates Generation Next event in 2019 in New York City.

In the days after the show, the young designer was on a proverbial high, staying up for three nights before eventually crashing out.

And then everything changed. Adeola went back to her family home in Lagos, Nigeria, to ride out the worst of lockdown.

""It was bittersweet,"" said Adeola, now back in her Manhattan studio. ""I was very grateful and thankful to be quarantined with my family but going from having my studio space to sharing a room with my sister ... it was just a lot.""

She spent the first month feeling as though she was at a total standstill and allowed herself time to be sad. But eventually Adeola got back to work. Reflecting on what got her going again, she said unwaveringly: ""I represent a generation that is going to change the world.""

With that mission in mind she dove back in, looking at paintings for hours and reconnecting with her original art history references, which inspired a series of face masks featuring her signature ruffles.

Adeola's ruffles are a subversive response to the art history books she first studied in school. As she tells it, her high school dissertation analyzed 16th-century Spanish dress in fine art paintings. Through her research of the works from that era, she noticed there were no Black people represented in the images, unless they were depicted as slaves or jesters. While this stuck with her, she said it didn't take away from the fact that the clothes in the pictures were beautiful.

""The way that the artists were able to capture the texture, the fabric, the materials with their brushstrokes was just incredible to me,"" she said. ""And ruffles -- they were called 'the ruff' at the time and they were made with starch ... The bigger your ruffle the higher you were in society.""

Adeola's ruffles do something to reclaim that part of history. In working them into her own designs, she's placed the power of the statement ruff in the hands of a young and diverse community of women. And the community has some noteworthy members: Gigi Hadid, Dua Lipa and Lizzo have all worn her pieces.

Celebrities aside, Adeola has made a point of surrounding herself with women. ""There would be no Tia without the women in my community who support me and who make things possible,"" she said. ""People go on the brand's Instagram page and see these amazing pictures that they love, but they don't realize there was a female makeup artist, there was a female hairstylist, there was a female photographer, there was a female set assistant. So all these women in my community come to mind when I'm making these clothes.""

Adeola won't be showing during New York Fashion Week this September, but she's working on a short film to release later in the fall. With the challenges of the pandemic still ongoing, the path ahead isn't clear cut for the designer, but one thing's for sure: she's determined to keep going and she'll be leaving ruffles along the trail."
398,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/beirut-explosion-cultural-impact/index.html,Beirut's cultural community was already at breaking point. Then the blast hit,"Already strained by a popular uprising, economic collapse and the global pandemic, Lebanon's cultural sector was blown apart by the devastating explosion last week. Can it be rebuilt?

India Stoughton lived and covered the arts and culture scene in Beirut for eight years. She's currently based in London due to the pandemic.

At the moment that one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history blasted outwards from Beirut's port and swept across the city, Zeina Arida, the director of Sursock Museum, was standing outside her office with two colleagues. The force of the explosion, less than a mile away, threw them into the museum's stairwell, as all around them windows shattered and glass and debris rained down. ""We have escaped by a miracle,"" Arida said over the phone three days later. ""The museum is blown away, very simply... There is no door, no window, no glass left in the building.""

The force of the explosion also brought down parts of the ceilings and internal walls in the museum, housed in an ornate white mansion dating from 1912. Less than five years after it reopened in October 2015 -- following a seven-year renovation costing more than $10 million -- the museum is a wreck.

It had displayed a significant collection of Lebanese art from the late 1800s onwards and was known to host regular temporary exhibitions by both Lebanese and international artists.

Many works from the institution's permanent collection were damaged but, according to Arida, the stained-glass windows that decorate the façade saved many more from destruction. ""The tinted glass is so thin that when we first went to look at the damage we were walking on a ground of colored powder,"" she said.

The enormous explosion, reportedly caused by 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse in Beirut's port, killed more than 170 people and injured over 6,000. More than 300,000 have been displaced from their homes. The explosion sent up a gigantic mushroom cloud and let loose a vast circle of destruction, damaging buildings miles away. ""I know so many people who were wounded, lost their houses. Some are dead... It's a living nightmare,"" said Arida.

Streets filled with artists

Beirut's tight-knit cultural sector is still in the throes of this crisis but it's clear that the explosion has had a devastating effect. Many of the city's art spaces were located in the cosmopolitan neighborhoods of Mar Mikhael and Gemmayzeh and in the industrial area of Karantina, all close to the epicenter of the blast. ""These streets were a hub for artists from many walks of life. [They] are filled with our friends, our colleagues,"" said playwright and filmmaker Lucien Bourjeily.

Three days after the explosion, he and others on the theater scene had set up an online group to offer help and support to those who had lost their homes and studios. Bourjeily, who helped organize protests in 2015 when rubbish was left to rot on the streets of Beirut, says artists play a crucial role in leading a call for change after the blast because they are often freelancers who are not as embedded in Lebanon's system of sectarian political patronage.

Galerie Tanit, located less than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from the explosion, was completely gutted by the blast, which destroyed all the windows and walls, leaving just concrete pillars behind. One employee was seriously injured and Jean-Marc Bonfils, the architect who designed the gallery and lived above it, was killed in the blast.

Gaia Fodoulian, the young director of Letitia Gallery, which closed in February after months of economic hardship, was also killed. Firas Dahwish, who worked at Agial Art Gallery and Saleh Barakat Gallery in the west of the city, was severely injured. He died in hospital five days later.

The Arab Image Foundation, which safeguards a significant collection of photographs documenting a century of life in the Middle East, was also badly damaged. Three staff and board members were injured.

As they mourn the dead, the city's gallerists, artists and creatives are struggling to process the damage to many of the city's most important cultural spaces. ""The city is destroyed. It's beyond description... There is not a single person in Beirut who has not been damaged... It's an unbelievable apocalypse,"" said gallerist Saleh Barakat, who opened Agial Art Gallery, one of the oldest art spaces in the city, in 1990, just after the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.

The explosion is widely perceived to have occurred as a direct result of entrenched corruption and dysfunction among leaders who have clung onto power for more than three decades. ""Maybe we needed this for a wake up call. We are very, very angry. We are burying our dead and we are taking care of our injured but the anger is just growing and growing,"" he said.

A slow road back to reopening

The disaster comes at the end of a year of upheaval that had already taken a heavy toll on the local culture scene. Last September, the 10th edition of the Beirut Art Fair attracted 36,000 visitors, signaling a decade of successful growth for Lebanon's art scene. Over the past five years, new commercial and non-profit arts spaces have sprung up all across the city. Amid upheaval in the wake of the Arab Spring, artists from across the region moved to Beirut, and international curators and dealers regularly traveled to its most important exhibitions. But massive anti-government demonstrations, which began last October and continued for months, caused many of the city's art spaces to strike in solidarity with protesters, allowing staff to join the demonstrations.

In March, Lebanon defaulted on some of its deb t as the lira went into free fall. People's life savings, tied up by the banks' discretionary capital controls, are largely believed to have been obliterated. Then the coronavirus pandemic came. It's estimated that 75% of Lebanon needs aid as a result of the pandemic.

""It is going to be very unlikely that things will go back to normal or the art scene can be functional again in less than six months,"" said Barakat. ""How can I open up again? I have no windows, I have no doors. I have nothing... I have seen a lot of very bad situations but there was hope every time... Now we were already broke. How are you going to do anything if you don't have any money?""

According to the gallerist, without an independent investigation into the causes of the explosion, no one has any hope that insurance will pay out. Money aside, he cannot fathom reopening while the same leaders many hold responsible for the explosion remain in power. ""We are not going to stop defending our cause, but there should be some changes before we can continue... We should dedicate our time and lives to changing the system, and then we'll see,"" he said.

Marfa' Projects, an exhibition space located next to the customs house in the Lebanese port, was completely destroyed by the explosion. ""All that time we were working, exhibiting, 500 meters (0.3 miles) away from a kind of nuclear bomb,"" said owner Joumana Asseily.

She had closed the gallery for a week due to lockdown. Anyone inside would have been killed. She said she no longer cares about the loss of her gallery. ""What is gone is gone. Even the artists don't care at this point. It's all material damages. What really enrages me is the people who lost their lives... The people who don't have houses, who don't have money to rebuild their houses.""

But she is determined to reopen -- although only once it's possible to rebuild at the port. ""The location was crucial for me,"" she said. ""You feel it is the heart of Beirut because everything passes there.""

For some, the challenge of rebuilding is simply too daunting. ""I don't think we're going to be able to pick ourselves up and move on... I am 55. I have reconstructed my life so many times, and this time it's just the last straw,"" said Antoine Haddad, whose gallery, Artlab, suffered extensive damage. He plans to emigrate to Canada, but will continue to run Artlab online. ""I owe the artists, morally. I'm engaged to provide for them.""

Andrée Sfeir-Semler, by contrast, is determined to reopen as soon as possible, even if she has to do it without any windows. ""Of course we want to go on... You need to nourish people with art and culture because that is what feeds their souls,"" she said. But Sfeir-Semler Gallery, located 1.7 kilometers (a little over a mile) from the explosion, is a wreck. ""The walls all broke down. The cinema imploded. We have a hole in the roof,"" she detailed, adding that a staff member who was at the galley when the explosion occurred only survived because she was in the bathroom.

Beneath the anger and sadness, many are simply exhausted. ""The culture scene relies so much on private initiatives and very often on specific individuals that have been fighting for the past 25 years, if not more, and what is frightening is that we are already so exhausted, so discouraged,"" said Sursock Museum director Zeina Arida.

A sad city

""We all have this feeling that what the state failed at building, they have just destroyed."" What gives her hope, however, is the support from other institutions, both local and international, who have pledged to help with everything from restoring artworks to renovations.

With the damage caused by the explosion estimated at up to $5 billion , concern is also growing about how to safeguard the city's architectural heritage . The areas closest to the blast contained some of the highest concentrations of Ottoman and Colonial-era architecture in Beirut. Many are worried that these buildings will now be torn down.

Gregory Buchakjian, an art historian and artist who spent 10 years documenting Beirut's abandoned buildings, described a long-running ""war"" between those who want to preserve the city's architectural heritage and the government, whose lax zoning laws and lack of formal protection for structures built after the 17th century leave Ottoman and French-mandate era buildings vulnerable to developers who want to tear them down and replace them with more lucrative skyscrapers. ""Many people were saying that the municipality will try to demolish buildings on the pretext that they are on the verge of collapsing,"" he said. ""It's definitely going to be a battle to preserve what can be preserved.""

He added: ""What is heartbreaking is that some of the buildings that were abandoned when I did my study were renovated, and now they are completely ruined.""

Sursock Palace, a private residence close to Sursock Museum, built in 1860, was painstakingly restored over 20 years after the civil war ended. The interior of the three-story mansion was torn apart by the blast. Ornate Ottoman painted wooden ceilings collapsed, leaving antique furnishings smashed and buried under wood, rubble and glass. Its owners say there is little point in trying to fix the damage while the same corrupt leaders remain in power.

Buchakjian believes it's too early to predict how the explosion will affect Beirut's culture scene in the long term. ""People are still just cleaning the rubble, assessing the damage.""

But some people are already looking ahead. ""There is this sense of solidarity... We really have the sense that we are all in trouble together,"" he said.

Back at the Sursock Museum, Arida has gathered the shattered pieces of two ceramic sculptures by Lebanese artist Simone Fattal, part of the permanent collection, in case the artist wants to use them to create something new. She has also offered use of the museum's storage spaces to other institutions and artists.

""It's a very sad city now... It's going to take years and it's going to take a lot of work,"" Marfa' Projects' Joumana Asseily said, but ""all these institutions are so essential, so important... It's going to be very difficult. A lot of them won't survive. But the ones that make it are more important than ever. They must go on. I can't imagine how, but we need them.""

399,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/remember-when-dolly-parton/index.html,Remember when Dolly Parton fully subverted the 'dumb blonde' cliché with her '80s excess styling?,"Written by Hannah Lack, CNN Video by Max Burnell, Angelica Pursley, Boglarka Kosztolanyi Contributors

Delving into the archives of pop culture history, ""Remember When?"" is a new series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras.

At the Los Angeles premiere of ""Steel Magnolias"" on November 9, 1989, country diva Dolly Parton was a walking embodiment of that decade of excess: skyscraper hair, elongated nails, pneumatic boobs, and a dress smothered in rhinestones. ""I kinda patterned my look after Cinderella and Mother Goose -- and the local hooker,"" she once said, always ready to beat her critics to a punchline.

It was perfect attire for a woman who now owned her own theme park, Dollywood. While early Parton favored down-home country checks, ruffled Grand Ole Opry-style gowns or bubblegum-pink jumpsuits, '80s Parton lit a rocket under her cowgirl look, multiplying the sequins and weaponizing the bimbo cliché. ""I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb... and I also know I'm not blonde,"" she is said to have quipped.

By the 1980s, the singer who wrote the hits ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" on the same day had parlayed her success as a Nashville country artist into mainstream pop stardom, and set her sights on Hollywood. She made her feature debut in 1980 with office revenge fantasy ""9 to 5"" -- Parton has said she wrote its hit title song on set, tapping out the beat with those icepick acrylic nails to mimic a typewriter.

""Steel Magnolias"" was Parton's fourth film, with an ensemble cast that included Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field, Julia Roberts and Daryl Hannah. Set amid the gossip and hairspray of a Louisiana beauty salon, on the surface it's chick-flick fare. But beneath the wedding cakes and Christmas sweaters run some unexpectedly complex, dark currents -- not to mention some killer one-liners (""In a good shoe I wear a size six, but a seven feels so good, I buy a size eight,"" Parton's character Truvy says with a beaming smile).

In that respect, the film was much like Parton herself: her fountain of platinum hair and surplus silicone have always gone hand-in-hand with prodigious talent, shrewd business sense, and a conviction that all of these things can coexist in one bedazzled package.

But life wasn't always so glitzy. It's hard to begrudge the joy of a princess dress to a woman who used burnt matchsticks for eyeliner as a teenager. One of 12 children born in a two-room cabin at the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains, in Locus Ridge, Tennessee, the tales from Parton's penniless childhood have found their way into her lyrics: the dolls made from corn cobs, or the coats stitched from rags that got her bullied by her classmates. Her sharecropper father is said to have paid the doctor who delivered her with a sack of cornmeal.

Parton debuted that crystal clear voice of hers at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville aged just 13. She was introduced by Johnny Cash, belted out the George Jones number ""You Gotta Be My Baby"" and got three encores.

Steeped in the rich musical traditions of Appalachian bluegrass and folk murder ballads, her early ""sad-ass songs,"" as she has described them, were anything but fluffy. She sang about abortion, teenage pregnancy, stillbirth, and suicide -- topics that jar with her perennially sunny, rhinestone-studded Southern persona, but this riddle of seeming contradictions has been part of Parton's appeal from the start.

Today, the multi-hyphenated phenomenon has sold more than 100 million records, won 11 Grammys, and had 25 No.1 singles. She has written memoirs and cookbooks and over 3,000 songs. She has a fortune estimated at $600m, a wig for every day of the year (or so the story goes), and a big-hearted appeal that appears to cross all divides.

But the singer has never forgotten her roots: Her charitable foundation, Imagination Library, dedicated to her illiterate father, delivers free books to children under the age of five -- over 100 million books to date -- and has sponsored scholarships for high school students in the region where she grew up. Visitors to Dollywood, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, with its rollercoasters and stores selling gumballs and Bible covers, can also step inside a loving recreation of her childhood cabin, complete with rusted tins and lye soap. Parton continues to call Tennessee home, living just outside of Nashville, the city that last year made August 5 ""Dolly Parton Day"".

Somewhere on the grounds of her estate, rumor has it, there is a bunker housing tens of thousands of her ensembles from over the years. As she's aged, her wardrobe has kept pace with the indefatigable diva, increasingly underlining her refusal to take herself too seriously: her looks have spanned from saloon madame to neon Peter Pan, mostly encasing her 5-foot frame as tightly as possible to accentuate her physics-defying bust-to-waist ratio. (""I like to buy clothes that are two sizes too small and then take them in a little,"" goes another Dollyism.)

She's been known to combine tassels, polka dots and stripes in a single outfit. She is that rare person who looks red-carpet-ready in triple denim. And she is the undisputed queen of matching her dress to her musical instrument -- Parton can play just about any, including the saxophone, guitar, banjo and, indeed, the pan-flute. Yet for all their cantilevered complexity, her costumes are still somewhat DIY -- she has said she buys many off the rack, adding her own adornments of beads and rhinestones.

Parton wore white from head-to-toe at Glastonbury, the muddiest of festivals, and since drawing huge crowds there back in 2014, the Smoky Mountain Songbird, as she is sometimes called, has been embraced by a new generation of fans. In 2018, creative director Alessandro Michele paid homage by crowning her his muse at Gucci, emblazoning Parton's face on the back of denim jackets and the front of pink sweatshirts for his Spring-Summer 2019 collection; at Bonnaroo 2019, rapper Post Malone stepped onstage in a suit plastered with her face.

There's a nine-episode NPR podcast about Parton's life (""Dolly Parton's America"") and a campy Netflix series (""Dolly Parton's Heartstrings"") devoted to the stories behind her songs.

At 74, she is increasingly considered a feminist icon, but Parton herself refuses to use the f-word. So her actions over her six-decade career will have to speak for themselves: this is a woman who stood up to Elvis and Colonel Parker by refusing to sign over the publishing rights to ""I Will Always Love You"" back in 1974, when the King wanted to record it -- a canny move considering the millions she has made from the song since.

From ditching her controlling mentor Porter Wagoner back in the '70s and steadfastly retaining the rights to her music, to her unapologetic nonchalance about cosmetic surgery today (""If I see something sagging, bagging or dragging I'll get it nipped, tucked or sucked""), there's little doubt that Dolly Parton has always been her own woman."

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

In 1912 thousands of supporters of the suffrage movement marched past the New York salon of Elizabeth Arden. The cosmetics brand founder, who had just opened her business two years earlier, was a supporter of women's rights, and she aligned herself with the cause by handing out tubes of bright red lipstick to the marching women.

Suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Charlotte Perkins Gilman loved red lipstick for its ability to shock men, and protesters donned the bold color en masse, adopting it as a sign of rebellion and liberation.

""There could not be a more perfect symbol of suffragettes than red lipstick, because it's not just powerful, it's female,"" said Rachel Felder, author of last year's ""Red Lipstick: An Ode to a Beauty Icon,"" in a phone interview. ""Suffragettes were about female strength, not just strength.""

Throughout the centuries red lipstick has signaled many things, from its early use by the elite in ancient Egypt and by prostitutes in ancient Greece, to its status in early Hollywood as a symbol of glamor. In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. ""Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist,"" Felder said.

Until lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup ""was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity,"" Felder said.

Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.

As women's rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists.

Though suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel.

After the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the ""modern woman"" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out.

During World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler ""famously hated red lipstick,"" Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead.

As men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. ""It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war."" J. Howard Miller's illustration of Rosie the Riveter, the cultural icon who was used to recruit and empower American female factory workers, notably had cherry-daubed lips.

In 1941 and for the duration of the war, red lipstick became mandatory for women who joined the US Army. Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing ""Victory Red"" and Helena Rubenstein introducing ""Regimental Red,"" among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her ""Montezuma Red"" matched and accentuated their uniforms' red piping.

""Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem,"" particularly, ""resilient and strong female self-esteem,"" said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.

Today, other protest symbols for women's empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women's March; and the habit from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" which has been worn internationally for women's causes, including pro-choice demonstrations.

Yet red lips still pack a punch. In a viral image from 2015, a Macedonian woman kissed an officer's riot shield during an anti-government protest, leaving a red kiss mark in a poignant moment of rebellion.

In 2018 in Nicaragua, women and men wore red lipstick and uploaded photos of themselves to social media to show their support for the release of anti-government protesters. They were reacting to activist Marlén Chow, who defied her interrogators by applying red lipstick.

Last December, nearly 10,000 women in Chile took to the streets wearing black blindfolds, red scarves, and red lips to denounce sexual violence in the country.

By wearing red lips, protesters all over the world have tapped into the same power the suffrage movement once plumbed a century earlier. In this bold, defiant beauty statement, their legacy lives on.

401,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/the-weaponization-of-a-first-ladys-image/index.html,The weaponization of a first lady's image,"Many a first lady has felt the warm glow of public adoration, only to have it quickly flicker out when it is decided that she does not fit the image created for her.

The role of first lady of the United States is one of the most visible public positions in the world. From the moment votes are counted, and often during campaigning in the preceding months, the spouse of a newly elected president is thrust into the spotlight, where she remains for the duration of his term.

Throughout history, we've witnessed the breadth and depth of scrutiny withstood by the women who have so far held the position. From her mannerisms, to her physical attributes, to the way she chooses to dress, the first lady is thoroughly examined by the public, the media and those surrounding her on the political stage. And this is even before people begin assessing the work she is expected to carry out as an unpaid, unofficial public servant.

Many a first lady has felt the warm glow of public adoration, only to have it quickly flicker out when it is decided that she does not fit the image created for her.

Image, in this case, isn't just about clothing and looks, but also a more nuanced notion of the impression she's thought to give off. It's an air around her that is made of both physical and personal traits. And a number of first ladies have fallen victim to aspects of their image that have been both celebrated and weaponized, depending on the onlooking crowd.

In ""First Ladies,"" a documentary series now airing on CNN, we see this paradox play out during six presidencies. The stories offer an ongoing reminder that a woman's public image is inextricably linked to her success and the level of respect she receives from the outside world.

“ As a black woman, too, I knew I'd be criticized if I was perceived as being showy and high end, and I'd be criticized also if I was too casual. ” Michelle Obama

So, why do critical voices repeatedly pass such undeserved judgment on these women? Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, offers her answer early in an episode about Michelle Obama: First ladies are meant to be the ""representation of American's better selves.""

When Americans elected their first Black president in 2008, the country's first Black first lady Michelle Obama was, to many adoring fans, a symbol of hope, opportunity and change. Girls and women around the world looked up to this smart, determined woman from Chicago's South Side who now lived in America's most famous house.

But her critics had a different take on her conviction and strength of character, and they were not afraid to make their often racist and sexist ideas known. On the campaign trail she was labeled ""angry,"" and her love and loyalty for America was questioned.

During the first few months of the Obama presidency her preference for sleeveless looks also drew extraordinary criticism. It was a phenomenon recalled by Robin Givhan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion editor and critic-at-large for the Washington Post, during an interview for ""First Ladies.""

""People zeroed in on her arms because they were not the arms of a fragile damsel who was White,"" she said in the episode about Obama. ""Non-White Americans have for years looked at a White first lady and were still able to say that she represented them. But I think it becomes a much more challenging thing for some White Americans to look at a Black first lady and see themselves in her. Instead, they simply saw her as an alien.""

By way of contrast, Jackie Kennedy had been mostly idolized for her beauty and style. While she did face flak from critics on the campaign trail for her expensive taste, from the moment she took to the stage on inauguration day in her now-iconic pillbox hat , Kennedy became the First Lady of Fashion. At age 31 -- young enough to be the daughter of the departing Mamie Eisenhower -- she was also seen as a symbol of youthful rejuvenation. She appeared on Capitol Hill for her husband's inauguration like ""the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,"" wrote historian Thurston Clarke in his 2004 book ""Ask Not.""

And as journalist Evan Thomas notes during an interview for the CNN series, she ""was the perfect prize of the WASP establishment.""

""She also knew that the Kennedy family was using her,"" Thomas added. ""She once said, 'the family treats me like, like a thing. Like an asset. Like Rhode Island.'""

Complex legacies

If history had played out differently, Jackie Kennedy's legacy might have been reduced to the story of a pretty object with a flair for interior design (she dedicated much of her time in the White House to renovating the official residence). Tragically, however, she had the opportunity to show the world what she was made of on the day of her husband's assassination. Hours after President Kennedy was shot beside her, she made a powerful decision: to face the public again in the same blood-stained pink dress she had worn during the attack, famously telling her staff, ""I want them to see what they've done to Jack.""

It was a catastrophic moment in American history. And it was also a devastating example of the power of clothing: A dress can send a message.

In Michelle Obama's memoir ""Becoming,"" the former first lady reveals the lengths she went to when styling herself for public appearances, finding it impossible not to look across the room at her husband: ""I sighed sometimes, watching Barack pull the same dark suit out of his closet and head off to work without even needing a comb,"" she wrote. ""His biggest fashion consideration for a public moment was whether to have his suit jacket on or off. Tie or no tie?""

She also discussed the particular challenges she faced as an African American. ""As a black woman, too, I knew I'd be criticized if I was perceived as being showy and high end, and I'd be criticized also if I was too casual. So I mixed it up. I'd match a high-end Michael Kors skirt with a T-shirt from Gap. I wore something from Target one day and Diane von Furstenberg the next.""

She knew society wouldn't bend for her. So, in a move that was at once inspiring and saddening, she bent to fit society.

But Michelle Obama won in the end. Her layered legacy, which will be defined by her work around issues of health, education and race, also acknowledges how graciously she used her platform to celebrate young, diverse fashion designers alongside the more established set. She wore Jason Wu, Prabal Gurung and Tracy Reese, offering them a moment in her limelight and helping their careers as a result.

""For me, my choices were simply a way to use my curious relationship with the public gaze to boost a diverse set of up-and-comers,"" she wrote.

“ As a woman running for President, I liked the visual cue that I was different from the men but also familiar. ” Hillary Clinton

Like Jackie Kennedy, Michelle Obama took the fact that she was being scrutinized and itemized for everything she wore and used it to her advantage. This, arguably limited power remains one of the ways that women in politics can make a statement without saying a word.

'First Ladies': Reagan's inauguration was 'very Hollywood' Credit: AFP/AFP/Getty Images

Conflicting expectations

Nancy Reagan was seen as a relic of old Hollywood when she entered the White House. The inauguration celebrations in 1981 were, by all accounts, lavish and glitzy affairs. Around 700 private jets flew into the city that weekend, and Reagan's gown -- a white beaded one-shouldered sheath of lace over silk satin, made by high-society couturier James Galanos -- was a show-stopper.

She and her husband, President Ronald Reagan, were both former actors who had met in Los Angeles in the 1940s, and their love for each other was like that of the silver screen. Her critics initially mocked the adoring way she looked at her husband, calling it ""the gaze,"" and she was seen as too wifely, too 1950s, too concerned with frills and the finer things in life, which seemed at odds with a country plunging into recession.

But, through the course of her husband's eight-year presidency she proved herself to be more than the outdated embodiment of a wealthy suburban wife. According to their son, Ron Reagan, who features in the documentary series, she wanted the President ""to be the frontman, and she wanted to be the producer/director behind the scenes.""

It was, perhaps, a precursor to the Clintons half-jokingly campaigning under the slogan ""buy one get one free."" Indeed, it's well-documented that Hillary Clinton often felt the scorn of the American public, due in part to her career-woman image. Ironically, while Reagan was criticized for being a 1950s housewife, Clinton was told she wasn't domesticated enough.

Her aggressors painted her as being too strong to stand back and let her politician husband call the shots and too weak to walk away when he was unfaithful.

For the most part, she rallied against these judgments. Clinton's pantsuits became her emblem -- her way of reminding people that she was a first lady with a law degree, an independent career and, ultimately, her own agenda, which she proved when she left the White House as Senator of New York, not effectively jobless like her husband. So, when her official portrait was released in 2004, Clinton was of course depicted wearing her signature black pantsuit, another first for a first lady.

She took her signature look on the road again during her 2016 presidential campaign. In her book ""What Happened"" she explained: ""As a woman running for President, I liked the visual cue that I was different from the men but also familiar.""

The tactic didn't pay off. Throughout one of the ugliest elections in US history, Clinton would come under repeated fire. This time she wasn't charismatic enough, she was shady, she was ""a liar.""

But was the biggest issue, actually, the same one as always? Once again, her image didn't fit the mold -- because the president was supposed to be a man.

Fashion is a creative dance between practical design and conceptual thinking. Success comes when the dance is so enthralling people can't look away.

Jonathan Anderson understands this well and, as a result, he's enjoyed high praise from critics and a loyal fanbase over the years.

Acting as the creative head of two brands -- Spanish house Loewe and his own London-based label JW Anderson -- the Northern Irish designer has defined his creative pursuits through collaboration and curation.

""I am an enabler. I am in a privileged position to shine a light on what other people do,"" he says of his role as creative director during an interview at JW Anderson's headquarters in London.

Watch now: Inside the mind of Jonathan Anderson, fashion's creative polymath

Unveiling JW Anderson's most recent collection without a traditional runway show, due to the ongoing pandemic, he instead sent would-be guests an interactive booklet featuring photographs of models in various new looks that could be cut out and played with. It was crafty, low-fi and a reminder that fashion is ultimately about making things.

Anderson is a collector of objects, and is passionate about supporting craftspeople and makers through exhibitions and initiatives like the Loewe Craft Prize (""craft is the one of the bedrocks of creativity,"" he says). He is also a creative polymath who happily moves between high-brow and mainstream influences, with references soaring and diving between art history and pop culture.

In ""Disobedient Bodies,"" a 2017 exhibition he curated at the Barbara Hepworth museum in Wakefield, England, Anderson brought together high art and fashion: Figurative sculptures by Henry Moore and Louise Bourgeois stood alongside fashion from the archives of Jean Paul Gaultier and Rei Kawakubo. He said, at the time, that there was ""an excitement about the dialogue of these two characters speaking to each other.""

Anderson has collaborated with a number of brands in recent years, from the accessible Topshop, Uniqlo and Converse to the luxury house of Versace. All of which begs the obvious question: How does he manage to keep so many projects straight in his head?

He admits to having a low threshold for boredom and thriving under pressure. He describes his creative of web of influences as a mind map -- the kind he worked with at school as a child.

""For me, it's all about mind-mapping. I sit at the center of it as an 'eye,' as the curator of it, and (radiating outwards) from that are satellite projects: There is Loewe, there is Moncler, there is JW Anderson, there's Uniqlo,"" he says. ""There are collaborations with artists, or there could be a museum retrospective... They all represent different things to me (and they) get me out of bed in the morning.""

Of these satellites, Moncler is his newest.

Under the banner of ""one house, different voices,"" the Moncler Genius project , which first launched during Milan Fashion Week in February 2018, has tossed aside the idea of appointing a single creative director to helm a fashion label. Instead, the Italian brand invites different creative directors to create individual collections that are released on a rolling calendar throughout the year.

Since its launch, a number of high-profile designers have taken part, including Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli, who designed two collections for the label before moving on. And the project's large-scale, immersive showcases, which exhibit the designers' collections in unique environments during Milan Fashion Week, have produced the very hype the label's CEO Remo Ruffini had hoped for.

Ruffini is up front about this strategy: ""The key objective of Genius wasn't to sell, but to create buzz around the brand, to surprise and to tell more about Moncler's different angles while also attracting new generations,"" he said via email.

Anderson's collection for Moncler Genius took pride of place in Milan amid the hubbub of last February's fashion week. Fast-forward to October and the pieces are now available to buy. In a perfectly choreographed move, a series of images shot by one of today's most sought-after photographers, Tyler Mitchell , were released online alongside the clothing drop. The playful, otherworldly photos generated further attention on Instagram -- and more of the buzz Moncler is after.

In the collection of puffed jackets, shorts and accessories, dedicated fans of Anderson's will see tributes to past his past work. This, he said, was entirely by design, calling it his ""'inflated archive."" A pair of ruffled shorts, for example, are an inflated version of the design he presented in JW Anderson's Autumn-Winter 2014 collection (albeit this time with the incorporation of dinosaur-like three-dimensional spikes).

Treating his Moncler collection as, in essence, a small retrospective might help onlookers struggling to see a reason, or imagine a buyer, for such outlandish designs. Collectors of fashion -- and his most dedicated and wealthy fans -- will no doubt invest in the pieces, which range from a £220 ($280) T-shirt to the designer's £2,390 ($3,000) interpretation of a black puffer jacket.

A look from the new collection by Jonathan Anderson for Moncler Genius.

Moncler will, of course, benefit from the attention, but collaborations like this also help Anderson diversify his revenue streams and extend the reach of his own personal brand. Such an approach is, in this day and age, strategically important. Consumers want deeper connections with the people behind the brands they lend their loyalty to.

But despite his ever-growing sphere of creative influence, Anderson hasn't lost sight of the philosophy at center of his mind map: that ""the making is what's important -- the brand comes second.""

Reflecting on the time that's passed since February he adds, ""I hope we have become more humble, that we actually want to hear the stories of craftspeople."""
403,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/dyeing-pollution-fashion-intl-hnk-dst-sept/index.html,Our colorful clothes are killing the environment,"Textile dyeing is one of the most polluting aspects of the global fashion industry, devastating the environment and posing health hazards to humans.

Asian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blame

This story was produced as part of CNN Style's The September Issues , a hub for facts, features and opinions about fashion, the climate crisis, and you.

When Haji Muhammad Abdus Salam looks across the trash-filled river near his home in one of Dhaka's major garment manufacturing districts, he remembers a time before the factories moved in.

""When I was young there were no garment factories here. We used to grow crops and loved to catch different kinds of fish. The atmosphere was very nice,"" he said from Savar, just north of the Bangladesh capital.

The river beside him is now black like an ink stain. Abdus Salam said waste from nearby garment factories and dye houses has polluted the water.

""There are no fish now,"" he said. ""The water is so polluted that our children and grandchildren cannot have the same experience.""

Bangladesh is the world's second biggest garment manufacturing hub after China, exporting $34 billion worth of garments in 2019. And clothes made, dyed and finished in the country often end up in main street shops across the United States and Europe.

But as consumers browse through the season's latest color trends, few will spare much thought to the dyes used to create everything from soft pastels to fluorescent hues -- or their toxic history.

Fashion is responsible for up to one-fifth of industrial water pollution, thanks in part to weak regulation and enforcement in producer countries like Bangladesh, where wastewater is commonly dumped directly into rivers and streams. The discharge is often a cocktail of carcinogenic chemicals, dyes, salts and heavy metals that not only hurt the environment, but pollute essential drinking water sources.

Bangladesh's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said it was ""striving towards minimizing the negative effect on environment from the largest export generating sectors including ready-made garments and textiles.""

Minister Shahab Uddin said in a statement e-mailed to CNN that a range of measures were being taken to address pollution, including updating conservation and environmental laws, imposing fines on polluters, monitoring water quality, setting up centralized treatment plants, and working with international development partners to improve wastewater treatment.

""Monitoring and enforcement activities ... are playing a vital role in combating the pollution caused by illegal polluting industries. We have a policy and legal framework in place to address the environmental pollution issues of the country,"" he said.

Ridwanul Haque, chief executive of the Dhaka-based NGO Agroho, called toxic chemical pollution a ""huge problem in a country like Bangladesh."" Haque, whose organization provides clean drinking water and free medical care to marginalized communities, said the rivers and canals that run through Dhaka have turned a ""pitch black color"" due to the sludge and sewage produced by textile dyeing and processing factories. The water is ""very thick ... like tar,"" and during the winter -- when monsoon rain no longer dilutes the wastewater -- ""you can smell it,"" he said.

One 55-year-old, who has lived in Savar for the past 18 years and didn't want to be identified for fear of reprisals, said the polluted waterways are a risk to his family's health.

""The kids get sick if they stay here,"" he said, adding that his two children and grandson are unable to live with him ""because of the water.""

Cost of color

The fashion industry uses around 93 billion cubic meters (21 trillion gallons) of water annually, enough to fill 37 million Olympic swimming pools, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Along with finishing, dyeing is the most polluting and energy-intensive processes involved in making our clothes.

Finishing is when chemicals or treatments are applied to fabric to give it the desired look or feel -- such as bleaching, softening or making the garment water resistant or anti-wrinkle. Large amounts of water and chemicals are also used during dyeing, to ensure vivid colors bind to the fabric and don't fade or wash out.

Take denim as an example.

Producing a single pair of jeans consumes around 7,500 liters (2,000 gallons) of water, from growing raw cotton to finished product, according to the United Nations.

To ensure its blue color, the thread or fabric is repeatedly dunked in huge vats of synthetic indigo dye. After dyeing, the denim is treated and washed with more chemicals to soften or texture it. Getting the faded or ""worn in"" look requires even more chemical bathing, which uses acids, enzymes, bleach and formaldehyde.

But jeans aren't the only polluters.

""Every season we know that the fashion industry needs to highlight new colors,"" said Ma Jun, one of China's leading environmentalists, in a phone interview. But, he added, ""each time you have a new color you're going to use more, new kinds of chemicals and dye stuffs and pigments and catalysts.""

Once they're done, the cheapest way for factories to get rid of unusable, chemical-laden wastewater is to dump it into nearby rivers and lakes.

Not all of the chemicals and solvents used are hazardous, though the World Bank has identified 72 toxic ones that stem solely from textile dyeing. Once in waterways, they accumulate to the point where light is prevented from penetrating the surface, reducing plants' ability to photosynthesize. This lowers oxygen levels in the water, killing aquatic plants and animals.

Also among them are chemicals and heavy metals that can build up in the body, increasing the risk of various cancers, acute illnesses and skin problems. Others have been found to increase in toxicity as they work their way up the food chain.

Chemical-laden water is also used to irrigate crops, with one recent study finding that textile dyes were present in vegetables and fruit grown around Savar.

Once in the wastewater, dyeing chemicals are difficult to remove, said Sarah Obser, head of sustainability at PFI Hong Kong, a company that provides environmental and factory audits in Asia. ""The substances don't degrade so they remain in the environment.""

While various types of dyes are used for different fabrics, azo dyes -- synthetic nitrogen-based dyes -- have come under particular scrutiny from the fashion industry and environmentalists. They are commonly used in garment manufacturing and produce bold colors like bright reds or yellows.

But some azo dyes under certain conditions break down and release aromatic amines, a type of chemical compound (also used in pesticides and pharmaceuticals) that can increase the risk of cancer. These are so toxic that the European Union, China, Japan, India and Vietnam have all banned their use and import.

Human impact

Water pollution from the textile industry is a huge problem across garment-producing countries, most of which are found in Asia due to its huge pool of cheap labor.

When environmentalist Ma founded the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) over a decade ago, many rivers and lakes in China -- the world's largest clothes manufacturer -- were so polluted that they were effectively dead, he said.

Since 2006, his NGO has developed pollution databases to monitor companies' environmental performance, tested water sources and color-coded rivers and lakes according to how polluted they are.

""In regions with concentrations of these dyes, we have seen some of the lakes in China contaminated to (such) a level that they are no longer good for use,"" said Ma.

Workers and people living close to factories often bear the brunt of the pollution. According to Ma, fishermen living near dye houses and textile mills along the tributaries of the Qiantang River have seen their catches shrink. ""They have lost their livelihoods because of it,"" he added.

In Bangladesh, the Savar resident who did not want to be named said he doesn't go into the water around his neighborhood anymore.

""This water causes sores on the body,"" he said, adding that people washing their hands or faces in the water have experienced fevers and skin irritation.

NGO executive Haque, whose organization sends mobile clinics to poorer communities around the country, said the toxic sludge also contaminates freshwater sources, because people use shallow wells.

""People don't have any other option so they have to ... drink (from) it. They are hopeless, they don't have money to install a filter or drill (for) deep water,"" he said.

Gastrointestinal problems and skin diseases are among the common ailments that he attributes directly to textile pollution.

CNN has reached out to Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Directorate of General Health Services, and Dhaka health officials for comment.

The chemicals used to dye clothes also impact garment workers who, in some factories, don't have adequate protective clothing and may inhale toxic fumes. In Dhaka, experts say there are a growing number of factories that comply with international standards on chemical use and management, but there are still many smaller or subcontracted factories where conditions continue to fall short.

""People don't have gloves or sandals, they're barefoot, they don't have masks, and they are working with dangerous chemicals or dyes in a congested area. They are like sweat factories,"" Haque said, from firsthand accounts that he's heard while working within communities tied to factories.

But because the textile industry is hugely important to Bangladesh's economy, accounting for 20% of its GDP and employing about 4 million people, residents like Abdus Salam don't want to see factories shuttered.

""Many of our people are working in these factories,"" he said. ""If they close these factories, the workers will become jobless.""

Shift in attitudes

But change is happening. In Bangladesh, there are signs textile producers are taking environmental responsibility more seriously, with brands committing to initiatives, such as the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), that tackle water, energy and chemical use in the industry.

And some Bangladeshi factories have environmental ""best practices and are developing their own connections"" with suppliers, said PFI Hong Kong's Obser. But ""it remains a challenge to fully eliminate those smaller non-compliant ones because the fashion industry is very intransparent and price focused,"" she added, saying many companies do not have the training, knowledge or the funds to treat wastewater discharge or invest in new waterless or environmentally-friendly technologies.

Bangladesh's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said it has made it mandatory for all polluting facilities to install effluent treatment plants and operate them ""optimally."" And under a new environmental policy called Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), textile dyeing, finishing and washing industries ""must submit a time-bound plan to reduce, recycle and reuse the wastewater,"" Uddin said.

""There is definitely room for further improvement,"" though rapid urbanization, high economic growth and industrialization all exacerbate the country's environmental problems. ""These challenges cannot be eliminated overnight,"" he added.

Other countries have also been taking steps. In China, a range of tough new environmental policies have been enacted in the past few years, including a 2017 crackdown on textile and other polluting factories that saw the temporary closure of thousands that were found to be flouting environmental laws. In 2018, the Chinese government introduced a new environment protection tax aimed at cutting polluting discharge, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.

Ma said factories and dye houses are increasingly being moved into industrial zones with centralized wastewater treatment plants, or being threatened with fines and closure if they don't comply with regulations.

Results have been ""dramatic,"" with many of the dead, black rivers he once saw coming back to life.

recent study found that such efforts have improved water quality in some regions but toxic and polluted water still persists in parts of the country.

The fashion industry as a whole has undergone what Greenpeace East Asia's Toxics Campaign Manager Ada Kong describes as ""a paradigm shift"" in its awareness of how chemicals are impacting the environment.

Greenpeace's ongoing ""Detox My Fashion"" campaign that aims to eliminate hazardous chemicals from the fashion industry has, since 2011, seen big brands like H&M, Adidas and Levi's committing to identifying suppliers and implementing tougher environmental regulations and chemical management in their factories and supply chains.

There has also been a push for innovation in finding alternative chemicals and new technologies leading to the development of more environmentally-friendly dyes

Mountain to climb

Many problems remain, however. For instance, China's centralized treatment plants sometimes can't cope with the volume of wastewater produced in its new industrial parks. And existing factories, saddled with costly treatment processes, often build secret discharge pipes or release their wastewater at night to avoid detection, Ma said.

CNN has reached out to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment for comment.

It also remains incredibly hard for consumers to navigate the complex web of supply chains the fashion industry is built on, even if they try to shop ethically . Often, fashion brands don't own their own factories so ""their relationships are not stable,"" with their many suppliers, said Kong.

""They may only work with that supplier for two months, or shorter, for a batch of goods and then shift to another one. This is not good for auditing or ensuring the suppliers are responsible for the environment.""

And while strides towards traceability and accountability have been made, there are still many brands and manufacturers not taking sustainability seriously, experts say.

""The mission has not yet been accomplished,"" said Ma.

Some experts believe the drive needs to come from big brands, which can encourage factories to build water treatment plants or invest in chemical-free technologies by committing to long-term contracts, even if costs rise.

""(What we're) asking for is that brands build a strong and long-lasting relationship with their suppliers, so they can have more say in their environmental performance,"" said Kong.

Yet, ridding the fashion industry of hazardous chemicals is likely to become even more challenging as our clothing addiction increases. Apparel consumption is set to rise by 63% to 102 million tons a year in 2030, according to a 2017 Pulse of the Fashion report.

""For the volume we are consuming, I don't think there is a solution or best scenario without reducing the volume of our consumption,"" Kong said. ""Even if all of us dress in organic cotton and natural dyes it would still be devastating.""

In Bangladesh, those living along Savar's black, contaminated rivers say they still feel helpless to stop the factories from polluting. Many fear repercussions from factory owners who often hold significant influence or political sway.

Frustration appears to be building nonetheless. And if authorities don't take further measures to clean up the water, Savar resident Abdus Salam said, then ""the future of this area will be full of darkness.""

This story was produced as part of CNN Style's The September Issues , a hub for facts, features and opinions about fashion, the climate crisis, and you.

Imagine a handbag that's strong enough for lugging around laptops and water bottles but one you could simply put in the compost heap at the end of its useful life. What's more, it has never been near an animal.

Vegan leather, a cruelty-free and environmentally friendly substitute for animal and synthetic leather (essentially made of plastic) has long been the holy grail of sustainable fashion.

Now, a viable alternative may be making the jump from the lab to closets, and its source may surprise many: the forest floor.

Mycelium, the fibrous roots of fungi, is being crafted into durable clothes, bags and watch straps with a lower carbon cost than animal hides or plastic, and it's a material that won't clog up landfills. While products made from it aren't available to buy yet, industry experts say the material has huge potential to disrupt the market for animal and synthetic leathers. And it has a unique look and feel.

""You touch it, and it's warm. It's not plastic-like,"" said Antoni Gandia, a fungi specialist who works as a scientific consultant with companies developing fungi-based materials.

""It has that fibrousness that you can find in real leather. It has features like porosity, you can see the pores of the organism of the fungi. You can see the little imperfections -- you can't see that with synthetic leather.""

It's grown on organic material such as sawdust or molasses, forming a mat before being treated to produce a leather-like material. It can be dyed, softened, embossed or imprinted with patterns and produced in sizes up to 30 square feet (2.5 square meters), according to a paper published September in the scientific journal Nature Sustainability co-authored by Gandia.

The process is relatively quick -- growing mycelium takes little more than a week, the study said

Carbon footprint

is now largely shunned -- leather's buttery appeal is perhaps more deeply ingrained. The global leather industry Mounting interest in animal-free products means fashion has long been on the hunt for an alternative to leather but, unlike fur -- whichis now largely shunned -- leather's buttery appeal is perhaps more deeply ingrained. The global leather industry is worth $100 billion a year

Leather production relies on hides from livestock farming, which is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and a driver of deforestation for grazing. Leather processing also uses hazardous chemicals and generates large amounts of sludge from treating raw hides.

lower environmental impact, according to the study. Most ""leather"" that is branded vegan is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PU) or some form of natural material combined with PU. While this synthetic leather has alower environmental impact, according to the Nature Sustainability study , and is of course animal free, the manufacturing process uses hazardous chemicals and it's also made from fossil fuels. And like most plastics, the material takes centuries to break down,according to the study.

By contrast, material made from the humble fungi has impeccable environmental credentials. Their growth is effectively carbon neutral since they capture and store carbon that would otherwise be emitted or remain in the atmosphere, according to the Nature Sustainability study. They don't require any light to grow and, other than sterilizing the raw materials, there is no direct energy input required.

Pure and untreated fungi-derived leather is also biodegradable.

""You can throw it in your garden. Maybe it takes two years but it will decompose,"" Gandia said.

'Beneath the forest floor'

said they consider sustainability when making a luxury purchase. A number of startups are banking on consumer interest in a truly vegan fungi leather. Some 66% of US respondents to a survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Companysaid they consider sustainability when making a luxury purchase.

California-based MycoWorks is perhaps closest to producing a commercially available product, with a luxury biomaterial they called Reishi. The company says it has the same quality and aesthetics as leather and it will launch its first products in partnership with ""top-tier"" brands in the coming months, said Sophia Wang, the company co-founder.

""We have committed our full inventory in the coming year to these brands and are now scaling production to provide Reishi to an even broader range of brands and designers in the future,"" she said, declining to name which companies they are working with.

Wang founded the company with Philip Ross, an artist and designer who began developing mycelium as a material for his work in the 1990s. Mycoworks' Italian rival Mogu was also founded by a designer, Maurizio Montalti.

""It took an artist's close observations and design experiments in live cultivation to direct our attention beyond the obvious -- the mushrooms we see in grocery stores or while walking in nature -- to explore mycelium's remarkable capacities, which had been hidden from view, beneath the forest floor,"" Wang said.

Other start-ups working with fungi-based material include New York-based Ecovativ and Mycotech in Indonesia. Some companies are experimenting with leather-like material made from plants, such as Piñatex, which uses pineapple leaf fiber, and collagen -- the protein present in cow leather. Zoa is a leather substitute grown in a lab from genetically modified yeast cells.

Challenges

One of the biggest challenges with fungi-derived leather is making a uniform ""mat"" with consistent thickness, appearance and color, according to the Nature Sustainability paper. It's also necessary to balance durability with biodegradability.

Montalti, the founder of Mogu, said while they have developed promising prototypes, ""they are not yet products.""

""Innovation needs time to deliver what people are looking for,"" he said. He compares the process to the development of Lycra -- a stretchy man-made fiber that can be combined with cotton or nylon and took more than a decade to become ubiquitous in clothing.

""We are able to deliver very consistent raw materials, and together with industrial players, the fashion industry, and luxury groups, we are working side by side to transform the raw material made from fungal fermentation into physical products to be used.""

""The possibilities are all out there but the reality is that the raw product is like any natural product -- subject to transformation and degradation,"" he said. ""That's not what the market is looking for. The market tends to look for a replacement of an animal product.""

The company is finalizing protocols on the best way to coat and treat the material -- a process comparable to tanning leather -- to make it more durable.

While he doesn't expect to launch a product for another 12 to 18 months, Montalti is ambitious for the future. It will one day be possible to grow items of clothing or accessories directly from the fungi, he said, and not just sell sheets of fungi-derived fabric.

Gandia agreed. He foresees a scenario where ""you can grow a leather jacket that can be thicker on the shoulders where it's worn more.""

""It's a material of its own."""

The case rests on one question: Did his ancestors help the Nazis?

Germany's ex-royals want their riches back, but past ties to Hitler stand in the way

Perched on a steep hilltop in southern Germany, the striking turrets of Hohenzollern Castle rise in contrast to the rolling countryside that surrounds them. The fortress is the ancestral seat of Germany's last imperial family. If the country still had a monarchy today, the castle's owners would be its royal family , led by Georg Friedrich, whose ceremonial title is also his legal surname: Prince of Prussia.

Inside, the would-be Kaiser Prince Georg cranes his neck towards an ornate family tree painted on the wall behind him. He proudly describes his lineage, which traces back through centuries of kings and queens who ruled over Prussia (a once-vast area that included parts of modern-day Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Russia and Denmark) through German monarchs like his great-great-grandfather, the Kaiser who led the country into World War I.

But, along with the castle and the wealth, Prince Georg has also inherited a very public and, at times, ugly legal battle with authorities to reclaim a family fortune confiscated after the fall of the Nazis. According to Prince Georg, the vast collection of more than 10,000 items includes everything from priceless artworks to the opulent heirlooms of German history's most powerful and important family.

The case was first filed decades ago , but it has recently provoked ire and outrage among the German public, many of whom believe he's entitled to nothing at all. And some historians are skeptical of his claims.

""I see it as my duty,"" he tells CNN, in his first ever TV interview on the subject. ""I think my family would fully agree to pursue these claims, whether the judges will eventually judge in our favor or not.""

Watch now: Germany's ex-royals want their riches back

Standing between Prince Georg's family and a cache of untold monetary and cultural value is a broadly worded German law that disqualifies those who helped the Nazis into power from restitution or compensation for lost property. To understand today's legal wrangling, you have to go back more than a century into a grim chapter of German history.

In 1918, following defeat in World War I, the country ditched its royal family to become a republic and a democracy. The then-Kaiser and his family gave up their power but got to keep a substantial part of the fortune they'd amassed over the centuries: castles, land, artworks, crowns, swords and jewels. The ex-royals then went into exile in the Netherlands.

After World War II, Germany was divided into west and east, with the communist Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic taking control of the latter and seizing the property of ordinary citizens and ex-royals alike. The vast majority of the then-privately-owned German royal fortune fell on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. It would take almost half a century for the Berlin Wall to come down.

Shortly after, in the 1990s, a reunified Germany passed a law allowing anyone whose property was expropriated to reclaim it. Millions of ordinary families that had fled East Germany used the legislation to reclaim their homes . But the law came with a very specific catch: Those who ""substantially supported"" the Nazis were ineligible.

This all means that a complex legal claim being debated in 2020 hinges, ultimately, on the actions of one man in the 1930s: Prince Georg's great-grandfather (and the son of Germany's last Kaiser, Wilhelm II), Crown Prince Wilhelm.

The result has the potential to shift large portions of museum collections from public to private hands.

""A court decision brings with it the danger of a decision in favour of the House of Hohenzollern and, in the worst-case scenario, of the large-scale removal of objects from the collections of cultural institutions,"" a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Culture told CNN by email. ""An out-of-court settlement, by contrast, would likely make it possible to avoid lengthy court proceedings and would provide a viable foundation for cooperation between the House of Hohenzollern and the affected cultural institutions.""

Asked if Prince Georg's claims are justified, a spokesperson for the Berlin Senate Department of Culture told CNN in an email, ""The political answer is no. From a legal point of view, things can look different. That is the only reason for the talks.""

And beyond the historical treasures at stake, the case ultimately gives rise to a question German society has long grappled with: how to judge the sins of your ancestors.

A uncomfortable family photo

At Hohenzollern Castle, Prince Georg is shown a photo he's seen before: It's his great grandfather Crown Prince Wilhelm, in 1933, dressed in a military uniform and a Nazi armband. He's standing above a large swastika at a rally of 80,000 members of the SA , a Nazi paramilitary group. By this time, Wilhelm had returned from exile on the condition that he wouldn't involve himself in politics -- a promise he apparently couldn't keep.

""It's very hard to look at,"" Prince Georg says. ""These pictures are very strong. Especially when you see the swastika on his arm. It always makes your breath stop, and you ask yourself, 'Why is he wearing that?'""

In the 1930s, Communism was a rising force around the world and the Great Depression had plunged people into poverty, drawing many Germans towards Adolf Hitler's nationalist agenda. Germany had been a fragile democracy for barely a decade when Hitler was elected Chancellor in 1933, the year Wilhelm was photographed in the Nazi armband. There are other photos like it, including one of the Crown Prince locked in a momentary gaze with a grinning Hitler.

Prince Georg says his great-grandfather may have been wearing a swastika, but his primary motivation was to return the monarchy to power -- and he believed Hitler could make that happen. The Nazi leader may have even entertained the possibility. A British newspaper reported in 1932 that he was secretly plotting, upon his election, to tear up the newly-enshrined democratic constitution and form a government ""with the ex-Crown Prince at its head.""

""The Crown Prince was driven by the idea of getting back monarchy or getting back to the throne,"" Prince Georg says of his great-grandfather. ""But he was also misled by the idea that it might be a better to appease the Nazis, at least at the beginning.""

“ This is a disempowered former prince. He was not widely respected. He was a playboy. ” Chris Clark, historian

It soon became clear that Hitler had no plans to hand over power to anyone. The Daily Mirror reported the Crown Prince was ""disappointed at Hitler's changed attitude towards the monarchy,"" though he continued publicly supporting him nonetheless.

""He thought that it might help to keep the (Nazis) in control and lead them (down a different path), which might be more fortunate for our country,"" Prince Georg said. ""And judging from now, this was a horrible misconception.""

Rather than enabling Hitler's rise, Wilhelm and the ex-royal family was, according to Prince Georg's reading, ""seen as a constant threat"" due to their ongoing popularity with some segments of the public. Proof of this, he says, can be seen in 1940, when tens of thousands of people took to Potsdam's streets to mourn the death of the Crown Prince's son. Or in 1944, when Hitler's secretary recalled that, following a failed attempt on his life, Hitler said, ""believe me, it will come out that the real instigator is the Crown Prince!"" He wasn't, and Hitler's paranoia is well documented. But Hitler's suspicion proves he saw the Crown Prince as a threat, not an ally, Prince Georg says.

""He was in a very difficult position because...If he had shown more opposition -- which he is now blamed for not doing -- I have no idea whether I would be sitting here,"" he says, explaining that a distant uncle was sent to a concentration camp for doing just that.

Yet, Prince Georg also argues that Wilhelm had neither the power nor the clout to prevent the dictator's rise.

""By this time, the Crown Prince lacked the political influence to substantially contribute to the rise of the Nazi regime,"" said Prince Georg.

This was the very position taken by Chris Clark, an historian at Cambridge University's St Catharine's College, in a 2011 research paper commissioned by Prince Georg's family, the House of Hohenzollern.

""This is a disempowered former prince,"" Clark told CNN. ""He was not widely respected. He was a playboy... he liked the look of Hitler, he was quite sympathetic with the Nazi party, but he didn't actually become a card-carrying Nazi.

""(Crown Prince Wilhelm's) lack of political talent, his lack of a powerful network and his lack of an official position from which he could wield power meant that, as much as he might want to help Hitler, his help wasn't especially effective.""

That didn't stop the Crown Prince from trying. In a New York newspaper column published in 1933, Wilhelm praised Hitler's ""clear-sighted and energetic leadership"" and blamed communists and Jews for Germany's tattered reputation.

In his paper, Clark concluded that although the Crown Prince undoubtedly supported Hitler, his support wasn't ""substantial."" In other words, the Hohenzollerns ought to be entitled to compensation.

Evolving historical evidence

Plenty of experts have disagreed with Clark -- hinting at the complexity of this longstanding legal battle. Now the Australian-British historian says he has changed his mind, citing newly-uncovered evidence showing that the Crown Prince had more public influence than originally thought.

""That's what happens in history,"" he says. ""We find out new stuff, we change our mind.""

This new evidence was unearthed by Stephan Malinowski, a historian at the University of Edinburgh whose research has concluded that the Crown Prince significantly contributed to the Nazi regime. Malinowski, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is one of four historians commissioned by the government and Prince Georg's family to investigate the relationship between Wilhelm and the Nazis.

CNN interviewed five additional historians for this story, four of whom now side with Malinowski, though most also agreed that neither side's case is iron-clad. Among them is John Rohl, who said that the Crown Prince had once bragged ""that he had actually transposed 2 million votes to Hitler,"" and Stephanie Middendorf, who argues that he helped make the Nazis more palatable to the upper-class elites he rubbed shoulders with.

But there are others who support Clark's original position -- historians like Wolfram Pyta, whose 155-page research paper, also commissioned by the House of Hohenzollern, concluded that the Crown Prince ""actively rejected the Nazi system."" Or, independent historian Benjamin Hasselhorn, who told CNN that the Crown Prince ""did provide support [to the Nazis] but not substantial support.""

The 1994 compensation law effectively ensures that the German government isn't forced to compensate industrial giants -- like Volkswagen and BMW -- who supported the Nazis' rise to power and relied on forced labor from concentration camps, to build cars during WWII. Both companies have acknowledged their historic responsibility and paid compensation to victims.

But the law's intent is unclear when it comes to former royals. In the 1800s, before Germany was a country, the region was comprised of many smaller kingdoms, each with their own royal, or noble, families. Some of them have already quietly secured restitution for property and land lost during communist rule in East Germany, like Michael-Benedikt Prince von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, who in 2003 dropped his claims for restitution of art works, manuscripts and the inventory of the Wartburg Castle near Eisenach, in return for €15.5 million ($18.2 million).

Cultural collateral

According to Prince Georg, the thousands of items on the line range from a simple coffee spoon to centuries-old works of art. Items that ended up outside Germany or were otherwise lost also form part of the negotiations, in case they eventually re-surface. His family is also seeking cash compensation of €1.2 million ($1.4 million), which represents the value of their land at the time it was seized.

According to the Prince's spokesperson, ""It is safe to assume that the current value of the family ́s private property taken by the communists is several hundred times higher."" Berlin state authorities meanwhile told CNN that the overall value of the Hohenzollerns' claim is ""high, but not quantifiable.""

There is no longer any property at stake, though the Prince recently settled his claim for the ancient Rheinfels Castle on the condition that the charity run by his wife receives a portion of ticket sales.

“ This debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action. ” Eckart Conze, historian

Complicating matters for the German government is the fact that Prince Georg is also the largest lender of art to cultural institutions in the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg (both facing legal claims along with the federal government) including the many paintings, furniture and other items on display at Charlottenburg Palace. He owns the crowns of the first Prussian King and Queen, which are displayed alongside an orb and scepter that he's seeking to have returned. He also owns the jewel-encrusted tobacco boxes that once belonged to Frederick the Great, the longest serving Prussian King.

The Prince says he's committed to keeping the disputed items on public display, regardless of whether they eventually change hands. ""I really strongly feel this cultural responsibility to contribute something to the country and to show these items to the public,"" he says. ""Actually, we are on the same side as the government.""

He insists his claim is not about money.

""If it was that easy, I think my ancestors would have sold this place, the Castle Hohenzollern... and we would have sold our (remaining) art collection, which we lend to Berlin and to Brandenburg"" he said. ""It's not as simple as just taking a check.""

Yet, he may face an uphill battle convincing a skeptical German public of his charitable motivations. And while the case has been quietly ongoing for decades, it has recently become a matter of public interest, thanks in part to Jan Böhmermann, host of a satirical program akin to ""The Daily Show.""

In the half-hour segment, the late-night comedian roasted Prince Georg for having the ""balls of steel"" to bring his demands to court. The comedian also dismissed his claims as outrageous and hypocritical, given that genocide victims in Germany's former colonies under the royals' rule were never compensated.

High-profile clashes

Prince Georg has also been criticized for his public handling of the case. His legal team has filed at least 30 warning letters and lawsuits, primarily targeting historians and journalists, since the case became public. Historian Eckart Conze says he was served with a lawsuit after criticizing the Prince for serving too many lawsuits. Specifically, he says the Prince's lawyers took aim at his claims that the legal threats were an attempt to ""suffocate an important and necessary public debate.""

Conze says he had a choice: refrain from making similar statements or prepare for a legal fight. The historian chose the latter and is awaiting his day in court, though many of his colleagues have kept quiet because they can't afford to do the same, he says. A German non-profit called the Open Knowledge Foundation is currently crowdfunding for the legal defense of journalists and historians who say that they have been threatened by the Hohenzollerns' lawyers.

""This debate really belongs in the public and it cannot, and should not, be suffocated by legal action,"" Conze says.

Prince Georg insists that he's never sued over critical reporting, only false or defamatory statements.

""I think it is very important to have the freedom of the press, as it is part of our constitution. And it's also a pillar of our democracy. But lying is not, and that was the only thing we tried to straighten.""

Asked if he regrets his public handling of the case, he says, ""We could have been better on that, yes.""

Negotiating positions

The would-be Kaiser -- who is also 202nd in line to the British throne according to royalty expert Marlene Koenig -- says he hasn't sought out attention, but the legal wrangling has made it impossible to avoid. When he first took over as head of the House of Hohenzollern at age 18, he initially wondered if he wanted the responsibility at all. But his grandfather asked him to continue the restitution case, he says, a promise that still motivates him today.

""I feel obliged to fulfill his last will because he also wrote very explicitly in his testament that he expects me to follow his footsteps,"" he said.

An extended interview with Prince Georg

But this case is, now, much bigger than Prince Georg or his grandfather. Beyond the moral question of how the legal system ought to judge the transgressions of the Crown Prince, it encourages a broader national discussion in a country that is still reconciling the past. Germany is, after all, still putting accused Nazi war criminals on trial 75 years after the end of the World War II. By asking whether Crown Prince Wilhelm facilitated the Nazis' rise, Prince Georg also thinks Germans ought to ask who else was responsible. What about the millions who voted for them? Or the big businesses who supported them?

This is, Prince Georg says, a national debate that's yet to be resolved."" (Our claims) are not the reason for the discussion... I think we are kind of a symptom for the whole discussion -- or the discussion that needs to take place,"" he says, clearly hoping the historical debate won't distract from Germany's more recent legal traditions: to judge a case based on the law, not society's evolving moral standards. ""I'm very happy that I live in a constitutional state.""

For now, neither the prince nor the Brandenburg government appear willing to risk an all-or-nothing outcome by taking the case to court. Both sides recently agreed to delay court proceedings, which were due to begin in August, for another year to give them more time to reach a negotiated settlement.

The world may be in the midst of a global pandemic, but visitors to a new Beijing exhibition could be forgiven for thinking the battle has already been won.

A triumphant art show celebrating the ""great spirit of the Chinese people"" in fighting Covid-19 opened this month at the country's National Museum, near Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing.

Through a collection of almost 180 artworks, including sculptures, watercolors and dramatic oil paintings of heroic doctors, the exhibition aims to document the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and its aftermath.

But given that the country heavily censors art, the contents of the museum's exhibition mirrors the official stance on China's containment of Covid-19 . Through images of aid workers, the exhibition's messaging also appears closely aligned with government narratives around the country's international response to the crisis -- or ""demonstrat(ing) China's responsibility as a major country in dealing with ... a major public health emergency,"" as the foreword at the show's entrance proclaims, despite criticism of officials' early attempts to suppress news of the virus ahead of the busy Chinese New Year holiday in January.

Once inside the exhibition, titled ""Unity is Strength,"" visitors are led through three sections: The work of established visual artists, followed by works of calligraphy and contributions from amateur artists from around the country.

It is in this first section, curated from over 75,000 submissions received by the China Artists Association, that some of the most striking images can be found.

Take the large-scale triptych by Pang Maokun, the head of a major arts institute, that shows a medical worker in various states of exhaustion. Or an oil painting depicting jubilant doctors and nurses in front of a large Chinese flag, evoking the style of Socialist Realism popular among revolutionary painters in the decades following the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949.

Both are typical of the exhibition's focus on China's medical response. Elsewhere, masked doctors are pictured putting on personal protective equipment, examining X-rays and gathering around patients' bedsides.

And while many of the subjects are unidentified, renowned epidemiologist Li Lanjuan and respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan both make a number of appearances -- the latter as a sculpted metal bust and a hyper-realistic oil portrait showing a small tear rolling down his cheek.

Images of the late whistleblower Li Wenliang , whose attempt to alert fellow doctors to the initial outbreak was silenced by authorities, are an unsurprising omission, however. So too are scenes that appeared to show Wuhan's overcrowded hospitals being pushed to their limits at the beginning of the crisis.

Spreading 'positive energy'

Other themes addressed in the exhibition include the ""resumption of work and production"" and the delivery of overseas medical aid -- both of which are presented as victories for the government as the country recovers from lockdown restrictions that brought much of China to a standstill earlier this year.

Construction workers, infection control staff in hazmat suits and delivery drivers all feature, as do soldiers and aid workers boarding buses and planes loaded with supplies.

In addition to paintings, the art on display comes in a variety of other media, including posters, seal carvings, comic strips and woodblock prints. A huge group statue, reminiscent of the famous revolutionary monument in Tiananmen Square, depicts more than a dozen masked workers with their arms raised in waves, clenched fists and thumbs-ups.

Little information is provided to visitors, aside from each artwork's title. But the content and context are clear enough -- and very much in keeping with President Xi Jinping's vision for the arts and cultural sectors. In a 2014 speech , echoing Communist China's founder Mao Zedong, the Chinese leader stressed that ""modern art and literature needs to take patriotism as its muse, guiding the people to establish and adhere to correct views of history, the nation, the country and culture.""

Xi also used the landmark speech to outline the importance of spreading ""positive energy"" through art -- a phrase used, verbatim, by the Chinese Artists Association's vice chairman Xu Li at the Covid-19-themed show's opening ceremony. The artworks, Xu added, are intended to ""unite the people and opens up new and powerful spiritual forces,"" according to remarks later published by the association

Getting back to normal

There are elements of truth beneath the veneer of propaganda, however.

The world's most populous country with 1.4 billion people has, to date, reported fewer than 90,000 cases and under 5,000 deaths, significantly lower than many of the world's other major economies. The virus now appears to be largely under control -- on the day of CNN's visit to the exhibition, mainland China recorded just 30 new cases of the virus, none of which were in Beijing.

Nonetheless, visitors to the museum, which reopened in May with a limited capacity of 3,000 people per day, are still required to wear a mask, undergo a temperature check and present a ""green"" code -- indicating that the user is not subject to quarantine restrictions and thus can move around freely -- on an official health tracking app.

The National Museum of China is not the only cultural institution in China to host pandemic-themed exhibitions, though others have approached the topic in somewhat less self-congratulatory ways. Shanghai's West Bund Museum has recently brought together work created by nine contemporary artists during lockdown and its aftermath, while the city's Science and Technology Museum considers the history of humans' fight against pandemics in its new show

407,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/skin-decision-netflix-plastic-surgery/index.html,'Skin Decision' re-thinks the classic makeover show to reveal an overlooked side of plastic surgery,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

For vanity or medical necessity? To enhance or to correct? Clients or patients? Plastic surgery has traditionally been divided into two separate camps: the cosmetic and the reconstructive.

Cosmetic procedures are broadly about the quest for beauty, whereas reconstructive ones restore functions lost or impaired. The two may share history, expertise and technology, but when it comes to our attitudes toward going under the knife, the dichotomy matters.

Netflix's new reality show ""Skin Decision: Before and After"" demonstrates, however, the distinction between what is considered cosmetic and reconstructive isn't always so clear.

Across the first season's eight episodes, Dr. Sheila Nazarian and nurse Jamie Sherrill consult patients carrying the scars, irregularities and deformities of personal trauma. Some have suffered violent attacks or road accidents; others bear painful reminders of lifelong acne or the physical damage of alcoholism.

But it could be argued that all of the participants stand to gain psychologically from undergoing some form of surgical or non-surgical cosmetic procedure, even if it isn't strictly necessary. Using their field's latest technologies, Nazarian and Sherrill eliminate scar tissue, smooth damaged skin and restore patients' smiles (quite literally in the case of one man, whose facial injuries caused pain every time he smiled).

They use tucks, fillers and lasers -- treatments that are, on paper, cosmetic rather than reconstructive. Yet, their patients aren't searching for perfection.

Unlike other plastic surgery reality shows, which routinely document wealthy participants' efforts to remove wrinkles, enlarge breasts or lift buttocks, those appearing on ""Skin Decision"" often just want to return to their former selves. As a patient with large amounts excess skin, following a dramatic weight loss, explains in one episode: ""I don't have to look like Barbie. I just want to look normal.""

""It's an emotional change, it's a therapeutic thing we do rather than just vanity and a spectacle."" Dr. Sheila Nazarian, ""Skin Decision""

Few participants better exemplify surgery's potential to transform people's lives than Katrina Goodwin, who appeared on the show following a horrific 2017 attack in which she was shot nine times by her then-husband, who went on to kill the pair's two young daughters. Nazarian and Sherrill helped to remove scar tissue on Goodwin's abdomen, reconstruct cavernous bullet wounds and remove a tattoo bearing her ex-husband's name using advanced laser equipment.

""Every time I took a shower I was reminded (of the tragedy),"" she told CNN over the phone from Washington, D.C. ""Now, when I take a shower I'm reminded ... that this is phase two. This is my new beginning.

""Before appearing on the show, I didn't realize how defeated I was -- defeated in my whole body language,"" she added. ""Now friends and family say, 'You walk taller, you walk prouder, you seem happier.' So it was a transformation, and a way for me to reclaim myself and feel complete, like a normal woman.""

Differing motives

When it comes to plastic surgery, the idea of normality is a subjective one, according to professor of clinical psychology and psychotherapy at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, Jürgen Margraf, who has studied the mental impact of undergoing cosmetic procedures.

""There's nothing to argue against getting rid of a scar -- why should you walk around with a scar?"" he said in a phone interview. ""But then you can extend this argument. Let's say you're born with a crooked nose. Why should you live with that and try to make the most of it?""

, for instance, who have such a distorted view of themselves that they ""will never be satisfied with whatever surgery you do."" Assessing patients' psychological suitability for surgery, therefore, also comes down to what they hope to achieve. There is a difference, Margraf said, between patients with just one bodily feature they're dissatisfied with and those with body dysmorphic disorder , for instance, who have such a distorted view of themselves that they ""will never be satisfied with whatever surgery you do.""

""Skin Decision"" surgeon Dr. Nazarian, who carries out a broad range of procedures at her Beverly Hills clinic, also appears more concerned with how realistic patients' expectations are -- and how likely they are to be pleased with the results.

""The question I'm constantly asking myself is, 'Is this person capable of happiness?'"" she said in a phone interview. ""If I think someone is perseverating over something imperceptible, I'll tell them, 'I don't think I can make you happy.'

""I think ('Skin Decision') is the first time that plastic surgery has been shown for what it is,"" she added. ""It's an emotional change, it's a therapeutic thing we do rather than just vanity and a spectacle.""

Patients in need

Today, a variety of cosmetic procedures are being used to treat patients in unexpected ways, according to Dr. Linda Lee, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear's Facial Nerve Center, part of Harvard Medical School.

Lee, who specializes in facial plastic surgery, has started using cosmetic fillers to treat patients with Bell's palsy , a condition that causes partial or complete paralysis on one side of the face. The non-invasive procedure sees a gel-like substance injected beneath the skin to restore volume.

""When the muscle is wasted, there's no surgery that's going to make that better. But two syringes of cheek filler make an amazing difference in five minutes,"" Lee said in a phone interview, saying that the injections have given her patients' faces a more balanced appearance.

""It's a different skill (as a doctor) -- I'm not trying to make you look younger, I'm trying to make you look symmetrical.""

But as far as insurers -- or, in countries with public healthcare systems, state hospitals -- are concerned, work like this exists in a ""gray area"" between cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, Lee said. Healthcare policies traditionally only pay out for procedures that are shown to restore function or the ability to carry out everyday tasks. (Nazarian said she would not expect the procedures carried out in ""Skin Decision"" to be covered by insurance companies in the US).

As such, participants in the Harvard Medical School study had to pay out of pocket for the injections, though they were offered at cost price (around $350 to $400 each). Lee hopes that her research can help encourage insurers to cover the treatment, which is far less invasive than alternatives like facial reanimation surgery -- even though ""people think of fillers as for aging and wrinkles.""

As one of the study's patients, Suzanne Nevins, attests, this ""cosmetic"" procedure can help restore function too. Having suffered paralysis on the right side of her face, the 67-year-old postnatal nurse said that her speech and ability to eat foods like soup had been impaired by the condition.

""I could cry, because I could not believe how much getting that lower lip firmer helped,"" she said in a phone interview. ""I ate better, I spoke better and I was much more comfortable. It's physical health, but it's also mental.""

For Lee, demonstrating the psychological benefits of the treatment is an important part of her research. Her study found that Bell's palsy patients were less likely to avoid photographs after receiving filler injections, and were less worried about people thinking they had suffered a stroke. Participants also reported what Lee described as a ""significant"" improvement in personal confidence after receiving the filler.

Beyond function

As our understanding of mental wellbeing becomes more nuanced and holistic, so too may our definition of ""functionality."" It more often relates to the physical, but what if a body issue affects a patient's ability to function socially, professionally or interpersonally?

""There's a continuum, from having social anxiety to being severely impaired (by it),"" said Margraf. ""At one end of the continuum, social anxiety has an illness-like quality that impairs your quality of life more than being a terminal cancer patient.""

For patients in ""Skin Decision"" and Harvard's Bell's palsy study alike, the potential psychological gains of cosmetic work are self-evident. Yet, there is evidence that patients' ability to benefit from aesthetic procedures depends on their mental well-being going into them.

""If you're not ready, if you're not strong enough and if you haven't gotten the right help mentally before doing this, you may be doing it for the wrong reasons."" Katrina Goodwin, patient on ""Skin Decision""

13-year study in Norway found that women with mental health issues who underwent cosmetic surgery were more likely to later experience depression, anxiety and eating problems, while another found that women who underwent breast augmentation were more likely to die by suicide.

""Past behavior is a good predator of future behavior,"" Margraf said. ""So, if you're depressed before the procedure, you'll come out more depressed, in comparison to others, in the future.""

Goodwin, who completed filming for the show two-and-a-half years after surviving the tragic murder-suicide, said that having cosmetic surgery ""opened my own mental prison."" But the 39-year-old also pointed to the dangers of treating it as a psychological cure-all.

""Your heart and mind have to be emotionally ready... If you're not ready, if you're not strong enough and if you haven't gotten the right help mentally before doing this, you may be doing it for the wrong reasons.""

408,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/fox-eye-trend-asian-cultural-appropriation-trnd/index.html,The 'fox eye' beauty trend continues to spread online. But critics insist it's racist,"Written by Alicia Lee, CNN

""Ching chong eyes!"" That's what elementary school kids used to call Sophie Wang. It was an insidious racist slur casually thrown around as they mocked her Asian ethnicity while pulling on the corner of their eyes. Upward for Japanese. To the side for Chinese. Downward for Korean.

Wang is now 17 and many years removed from the days when her Asian American identity was reduced to ""a single facial feature."" And yet, scrolling through social media posts in recent months has brought those memories flooding back thanks to a new beauty trend: ""fox eyes.""

On Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, people from all over the world have been posting videos and photos modeling the look -- using makeup and other tactics to emulate the lifted, so-called ""almond-shaped"" eyes of celebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Megan Fox.

Fox-eye makeup tutorials show how to use a combination of eye shadow, eyeliner and fake eyelashes, to get a winged aesthetic. Tips include shaving off the tail end of eyebrows and redrawing them to appear straighter and angled upwards. Others have also suggested pulling hair back into a high ponytail or using tape to further lift the eyes. Accentuating eyes to appear slanted, or elongated in shape, creates a more sultry effect, according to some makeup artists creating the look.

But to Wang and other Asian Americans, the ""migraine pose"" that sometimes accompanies these images -- using one or two hands to pull the eyes up by the temples to exaggerate the result -- is far too similar to the action used to demean them in the past.

Emma Chamberlain, an influencer with 9.8 million followers on Instagram, was recently criticized for posting a picture that showed her striking this pose while sticking out her tongue.

Her fans rushed to defend her, commenting that those that felt offended were ""overreacting."" Chamberlain later deleted the picture and apologized , saying it wasn't her ""intention"" to pose in an ""insensitive way"" and that she was ""so sorry to those who were hurt by it.""

But the damage had already been done.

""They mock my eyes then say ching chong call me a dog eater and then call me a ch*nk. Like why would you think I'd be fine with Emma's post?"" one person tweeted . ""Obviously if she gets to do slant eyes whilst getting praised but it's my natural eye shape and I'm getting discriminated (of course) I'm mad.""

""It's a new trend that brings out old stereotypes and old taunts,"" Wang said in a phone interview. ""Because it makes people like me feel uncomfortable and (to) some degree annoyed, it's time to talk about it.""

What people don't understand, Wang wrote in an op-ed for student-run newspaper Stanford Daily in July, is that the gesture has ""racially-charged historical weight,"" referring to past satirical depictions of Asians in Western media -- caricatures poking fun at facial features to portray them as ""barbaric,"" ""subhuman"" and inferior.

""Yet in the 21st century, these Asian features have suddenly transformed into beauty trends for non-Asian people,"" she wrote, adding that the trend is an act of cultural appropriation.

Appropriating Asian eyes

Kelly H. Chong, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas, defines cultural appropriation as the adoption, often unacknowledged or inappropriate, of the ideas, practices, customs and cultural identity markers of one group by members of another group whom have greater privilege or power.

""The cultural influencers from the dominant group legitimize it as a cool, style 'trend,' and in the process exoticizes and eroticizes it,"" Chong added in an e-mail interview. Even the term ""almond eyes,"" she says, which is being used to describe the shape of fox eyes, has long been used to describe the shape of Asian eyes.

She points to Hollywood's uncomfortable past in the appropriating the shape of Asian eyes. In the early 1930s, makeup artist Cecil Holland used techniques -- some, similar to creating fox eyes today -- to transform White actors into villainous Asian characters, like Fu Manchu. And Mickey Rooney, the White actor playing the part of Holly Golightly's thickly-accented Japanese neighbor in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" cemented ""the buck-toothed, slit-eyed Asian man look"" in the popular imagination.

TikTok user @LeahMelle, whose video denouncing the fox-eye look went viral, said she couldn't believe that such a trend could be so popular nowadays.

""This wasn't some dated movie where you could blame the distorted norms of the time period. This was happening now. And it was still viewed as acceptable,"" she wrote in an email.

Like most beauty trends, the craze for fox eyes will eventually subside, and has begun to already since it first came about earlier this year. But that's exactly the problem, according to Stephanie Hu, founder of Dear Asian Youth, a California-based organization that encourages Asian activism.

In an Instagram post , entitled ""The problem with the #FoxEye trend,"" the organization wrote, ""While it may not have originated from a place of ill-intent, it appropriates our eyes and is ignorant of past racism.""

""It really feels like this is a temporary trend,"" Hu said, adding that she believes Asians' eye shapes aren't just something to be casually adopted and then ""given back"" when the trend is over.

""Our eyes are something that we have to live with every day,"" Hu said in a phone interview.

Pressure to assimilate

Many Asians have long felt the pressure to alter the shape of their eyes, and to make them appear larger.

Blepharoplasty is used to create double eyelids, or a supratarsal eyelid crease. It's one of the most common cosmetic procedures in East Asian countries, as well as among Asian Americans. But when it was first popularized, in the early 1950s, it was used as a tool for Korean women to assimilate in the US.

According to The Korea Herald , American military plastic surgeon Dr. David Ralph Millard first performed the surgery during the Korean War. His first patients were Korean war brides who had married American soldiers. Because the brides were considered ""both cultural and racial threats to the US,"" the paper wrote, many of them would get the surgery in an effort to assimilate and appear ""less threatening.""

""Surgically altering the 'slanted' eyes became a mark of a 'good' and trustworthy Asian, one whose modification of the face provided a comforting illustration of the pliable Asian, and served as evidence of the US as the model and Asia as the mimic,"" wrote Taeyon Kim, then a PhD student at Bowling Green State University, in her 2005 dissertation, which is quoted in the article.

""While it is primarily beauty that motivates (today's women's) desire to alter their eyes, this beauty is built on a legacy of history of Western science and race that privileged the white body as the normal, beautiful body,"" Kim wrote.

That pressure to assimilate has carried to recent decades. In 2013, TV personality and news anchor Julie Chen, revealed on ""The Talk"" that she had blepharoplasty done as a 25-year-old, to get ahead in her career. A former boss had told her that ""Asian eyes"" made her look ""disinterested"" and ""bored.""

After surgery, Chen said, ""I did look better, at least by societal standards,"" in a 2016 op-ed for Glamour.

When social trends go viral

What is deemed attractive these days is significantly influenced by social media, where beauty trends can quickly go viral, and arguably just as quickly become destructive to a person's confidence and self worth.

On Tiktok, the hashtag #foxeye has already accumulated 72.8 million views, while on Instagram, the hashtag #foxeyes has more than 70,000 posts.

Asian American makeup artist Marc Reagan said when he first spotted the fox eye trend, he didn't think it was problematic. He simply saw it as a set of makeup techniques to enhance the eyes and to exaggerate an almond shape.

But it ""morphed into something different,"" he said, noting that it became offensive when people started adding the gesture of pulling up at the temples.

""I absolutely think that everyone needs to pause before they take (that) action,"" Reagan said in a phone interview. ""Everyone needs to pause, take a step back: 'Is this something that could be interpreted the wrong way?' 'Am I taking it down the path where it turns from being a simple makeup trend into appropriation?'""

Reagan added he isn't surprised that some people are feeling hurt by the trend, especially in light of the pandemic, when East Asians have been increasingly targeted with racist attacks or slurs . Some people, including the US president have referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" or ""kung flu .""

""You can't be surprised that someone's going to be offended by you exaggerating a feature on your face that mimics something that they've been made fun of or discriminated against for. So we are (living) in a really sensitive time and those types of things need to be taken (into consideration) every single day.""

China's Three Gorges Dam is one of the largest ever created. Was it worth it?

Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydropower project ever built.

When construction began in 1994, it was designed not only to generate electricity to propel China's breakneck economic growth, but also to tame China's longest river, shield millions of people from fatal floods and, as a symbol of technological prowess, become a searing point of national pride.

But it hasn't quite worked out that way.

people along the Yangtze River. And while the government be able to protect communities around its immediate downstream against a ""once in a century flood,"" its efficacy has frequently been questioned. For a start, the whole project cost 200 billion yuan ($28.6 billion), took nearly two decades to build, and required uprooting more than a millionpeople along the Yangtze River. And while the government promised the dam wouldbe able to protect communities around its immediate downstream against a ""once in a century flood,"" its efficacy has frequentlybeen questioned.

Those doubts recently resurfaced, as the Yangtze basin saw its heaviest average rainfall in nearly 60 years since June, causing the river and its many tributaries to overflow.

More than 158 people have died or gone missing, 3.67 million residents have been displaced and 54.8 million people have been affected, causing a devastating 144 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) in economic losses.

told China's state news agency Despite the havoc, Chinese authorities claim the Three Gorges Dam has succeeded in playing a "" crucial role "" in intercepting floodwaters. The dam's operator, China Three Gorges Corporation,told China's state news agency Xinhua that the dam has intercepted 18.2 billion cubic meters of potential floodwater. A water resources ministry official told state-run newspaper China Youth Daily that the dam ""effectively reduced the speed and extent of water level rises"" on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze.

But with multiple gauging stations monitoring river flows in the Yangtze basin seeing record-high water levels this summer, some geologists say the limited role of the Three Gorges Dam in flood control has been laid bare.

'A tea cup for a big tub of water'

The Three Gorges Dam is an awe-inspiring structure.

Firstly, it is one of the few man-made structures on Earth that's visible to the naked eye from space, according to NASA . Completed in 2006, the body of the dam is immense. It is 181 meters (607 feet) tall and spans 2,335 meters (1.45 miles) across the Yangtze just before the deep, narrow valley gives way to plains.

Then there's its accompanying hydropower plant, which was completed in 2012 and has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts, or more than three times the capacity of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest in the United States.

top reason for building the dam wasn't power generation, but to prevent flooding. But according to the Chinese government's 1992 proposal , thetop reason for building the damwasn't power generation, but to prevent flooding.

Here's how it works: the enormous dam is situated on an upstream section of the Yangtze and helps prevent flooding downstream by trapping rainwater in a huge reservoir, and then controlling the release of that water through its sluice gates. The 660 kilometer (410 mile) reservoir winds upstream through the narrow valleys of the Three Gorges -- a series of steep canyons known for their imposing beauty and once treacherous currents -- to Chongqing, a sprawling municipality of 30.5 million people in western China.

During the dry season, October to May, the reservoir's water level is kept at a maximum of 175 meters (574 feet) to optimize electricity generation at the adjoining hydropower plant. Before the summer rains arrive in June, it's gradually lowered to 145 meters (475 feet) to make room for the incoming floodwaters.

The lowering of water levels creates 22 billion cubic meters of storage space -- enough to contain nearly 9 million Olympic-size swimming pools of water. But that's nothing compared with the sheer volume of floodwater that can flow into the dam during bad years, said Fan Xiao, a Chinese geologist and long-time critic of the dam.

During a ""once-a-century flood"" more than 244 billion cubic meters of water -- or about twice the volume of the Dead Sea -- can pass through the Three Gorges in two months, according to Fan's calculations.

The storage capacity of the dam's reservoir can handle only about 9% of that amount, he added.

""It's like using a small cup to deal with a big tub of water. In terms of flood control, the cost of the dam has surely outweighed the gain.""

Besides, the dam can only hold back the water for so long, as it has to make room for new rains -- and in flood season torrential downpours can come in quick succession.

Last month, three flood waves have already hit the Three Gorges. The dam has opened its sluice gates multiple times since late June to release water from its reservoir, drawing criticism on Chinese social media that this exacerbated the floods downstream.

delay and stagger the floodwaters reaching downstream. The company running the dam denied this, telling state-run tabloid the Global Times that it had helped todelay and stagger the floodwaters reaching downstream.

But Poyang Lake, in Jiangxi province, still swelled to its highest level in history -- surpassing the previous record set by catastrophic floods in 1998, which killed more than 3,000 people. Other places downstream also broke historical records.

David Shankman, an emeritus professor of geography at the University of Alabama, who has studied flooding on the middle Yangtze, said the record-breaking water levels showed that the Three Gorges Dam could not prevent severe floods. ""That's a factual statement,"" he said. ""This dam is fully operational for many years now, and now we have the highest water level ever recorded.""

Studies by Chinese and foreign researchers over the years, Shankman added, have found that the dam's reservoir is too small to significantly reduce downstream discharge during severe floods, although it does help alleviate flooding during normal years.

Miroslav Marence, an associate professor of storage and hydropower at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, said the problem is not the design of the dam, but the expectation that the dam can solve all the problems of flooding on the Yangtze, the third largest river by volume in the world. ""It's impossible to do it just with a dam,"" he said.

For example, while the Three Gorges Dam can reduce the intensity of floods coming from upstream to a certain extent, it won't be able to prevent floods caused by intense rainfall on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze or the tributaries in its basin entirely, he added.

And that is part of the problem: A lot of the flooding in central and southern China this summer, for instance, was caused by rains that fell downstream and didn't ever go through the dam.

The dream of every Chinese leader

The Chinese have for millennia manipulated waterways for flood control, irrigation and navigation. For China's imperial rulers, the ability to harness rivers not only saved lives and brought prosperity, but also gave legitimacy to their reign, as natural disasters were taken as a sign that the emperor had lost the mandate of heaven, by which he ruled.

This ambition to control water resources has only grown in modern times, with the prowess of technology.

Every Chinese leader since Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, dreamed of building a massive dam on the Yangtze, which has repeatedly wreaked havoc on its banks during flood season.

In an industrial blueprint he laid out for the Republic of China in 1919, Sun envisioned damming the Three Gorges to improve navigation and provide hydropower for the whole country.

The revolutionary leader did not live to see this dream realized. His successor Chiang Kai-shek carried on with the task in the 1940s, inviting renowned American engineer John L. Savage -- best known for his work on the Hoover Dam -- to survey the valleys and draw up a design for the Three Gorges Dam. Chiang even sent dozens of Chinese engineers to the US for training, but the project was abandoned during the Chinese Civil War.

After the Chinese Communist Party took power, Chairman Mao Zedong endorsed the project, writing about ""walls of stone"" and ""a smooth lake rising in the narrow gorges"" in a poem. But his plans were disrupted by the turmoil of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

When his successor Deng Xiaoping brought up the idea again in the late 1970s, it was strongly opposed by some leading hydrologists, intellectuals and environmentalists, who pointed to its human and environmental costs, from the mass relocation of residents to threats of geological hazards, environmental damage and loss of archeological sites.

"" It was heavily debated throughout the next decade, which was the most politically relaxed and liberal era in the history of Chinese Communist rule. But following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, open dissent was stifled and the political atmosphere turned oppressive. Four months after the massacre, authorities banned Yangtze! Yangtze! "" -- a book highly critical of the project -- and jailed its author, Dai Qing , a journalist and one of China's earliest environmentalists.

Confident that it could now push through the plan, the government put the dam to a vote before the country's legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), in 1992. The dam was approved, but about one-third of the delegates refused to endorse the plan -- an astonishingly low approval rate for China's usually compliant rubber-stamp parliament.

Some delegates said they were blindsided when the Three Gorges Dam suddenly appeared on the NPC's agenda, without advance notice or discussions about the project, according to a 1994 edition of ""Yangtze! Yangtze!""

Yang Xinren, a delegate from Jilin province in northeastern China, was quoted by the book as saying : ""The majority of the delegates are not fully informed of the technical aspects of the project. So no matter how we vote, we vote in blindness.""

Why is the dam so controversial?

One of the most controversial aspects of the mega-project was its enormous cost for villagers who had lived for centuries on the banks of the river. To make way for the dam's massive reservoir, about 1.4 million people were uprooted, their ancestral homes demolished, communities broken up and farmlands flooded.

Building the Three Gorges Dam displaced more people than the three largest Chinese dams before it combined. The reservoir submerged two cities, 114 towns and 1,680 villages along the river banks.

Displaced residents have complained about inadequate compensation and a lack of farmland and jobs after relocation. Many have accused local governments of embezzling resettlement funds and using excessive force to quell protests. In 2013, the Chinese government acknowledged that some of the funds were embezzled or misused.

Many also faced a reduction in living wages. According to Chen Guojie, a scholar at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Sciences, incomes of migrant families dropped by 20% after relocating, as they were forced to abandon their fertile riverside flatlands to farm on the steep, unsteady slopes.

The dam has also had a serious geological impact. Chinese officials and experts admitted at a forum in 2007 that the Three Gorges Dam had caused an array of ecological ills, including more frequent landslides, China's state news agency Xinhua reported at the time.

""The huge weight of the water behind the Three Gorges Dam had started to erode the Yangtze's banks in many places, which, together with frequent fluctuations in water levels, had triggered a series of landslides,"" the Xinhua report said, citing officials and experts at a meeting.

The water in the reservoir saturates and erodes the base of the cliffs, and the fluctuation in water levels changes the weight of the reservoir and the pressure on the slopes, destabilizing the shoreline, geologists say

The first disaster came in 2003, shortly after the reservoir started to fill for the first time. As the water reached 135 meters (115 feet), landslides began to occur. A few weeks later, on a tributary of the Three Gorges, a large chunk of a mountain split off and slipped into the river, killing 24 people, destroying 346 houses and capsizing over 20 boats.

The dam, which sits near two major fault lines, has also been blamed for a surge in earthquakes in the region. Scientists argue that the weight of the large reservoir and the permeation of water into the rocks underneath can trigger earthquakes in regions already under considerable tectonic stress.

According to a study from the China Earthquake Administration, in the six years after the reservoir was filled in June 2003, 3,429 earthquakes were recorded along the reservoir; only 94 earthquakes were recorded from January 2000 to May 2003.

Another major concern is the blocking of sediments. By cutting the flow of the Yangtze River, the dam has retained huge amounts of silt, which not only dampens its flood control capacity by filling the reservoir, but also causes significant erosion downstream.

days after the reservoir was filled for the first time in 2003, didn't help to alleviate concerns about the dam's safety. Officials said at the time that the cracks were not a threat to the dam, but could cause leaking if not fixed, according to And finally, the discovery of 80 large cracks on the Three Gorges Dam's concrete face, justdays after the reservoir was filled for the first time in 2003, didn't help to alleviate concerns about the dam's safety. Officials said at the time that the cracks were not a threat to the dam, but could cause leaking if not fixed, according to Xinhua.

For those who remembered the collapse of 62 dams in Henan in 1975, amid heavy downpours during a typhoon, it was of little comfort. That event killed more than 26,000 people by the official count -- though other estimates were several times higher.

This year, as the floods worsened, rumors over the Three Gorges Dam's deformation have resurfaced, drawing fierce rebuttal from state media.

But in 2011, the Chinese government admitted the Three Gorges Dam had created a range of major problems.

""While the Three Gorges project provides huge comprehensive benefits, there are urgent problems that need to be addressed, such as stabilizing and improving living conditions for relocated people, protecting the environment, and preventing geological disasters,"" China's cabinet, the State Council, said in a statement

Changing attitudes

A month before the Three Gorges Dam broke ground in late 1994, Daniel P. Beard, the Commissioner of the US Bureau of Reclamation, declared ""the dam building era in the United States"" to be over, at an international conference. The US would be finding alternative ways to solve water problems.

The costs of such projects exceeded original estimates and many benefits were never realized, Beard said.

Shankman, the geologist at Alabama University, said many dams in the northwestern coast of the US were actually removed because they blocked the migration of fish from the ocean up the rivers, causing their populations to drop. In the southeast of the country, upstream dams in the mountains created environmental problems, driving fish species to extinction, causing water pollution, and the recession of coastlines due to the blocking of sediments.

Marence, the dam expert in the Netherlands, said after the boom in dam building from the 1950s to the 1980s, more countries and organizations started to become aware of their environmental impacts.

2019, China had But China pushed on. By2019, China had 23,841 large dams, accounting for 41% of the world total, with Fan saying most of them were built after 2000. The US was the runner-up on the list, with 9,263 large dams, according to the International Commission on Large Dams. The organization defines a ""large dam"" as a dam with a height of 15 meters (49 feet) or greater, or a dam between 5 meters and 15 meters which can contain more than 3 million cubic meters in its reservoir.

But dams with hydropower facilities do ""produce a lot of cheap energy, and it's renewable,"" said Matthijs Kok, a hydraulic engineering professor at Delft University of Technology.

""However, they have an environmental price, and if we want to build new dams, we should look carefully at the environmental damage. We have to find compromise,"" he said.

Some geologists say instead of relying on dams to stop flooding, we should give rivers space and allow them to expand during the flood season.

""Large alluvial rivers naturally flood during the wet season. Floodwater is not a problem, that's simply what rivers do. The problem is when you have a lot of people living in the areas that are subject to flooding,"" Shankman said.

Along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze are some of China's most densely populated areas. For centuries, people have built levees to protect their communities and farmlands from flooding. But these measures, too, are imperfect.

With the climate crisis expected to bring about heavier, more frequent flooding, some experts say China will be forced to find new solutions for future generations.

But will it be possible -- or even safe -- to make radical works in the increasingly charged political climate?

Few in Hong Kong will forget the iconic ""Lady Liberty"" -- a towering white statue depicting a protester in goggles and a gas mask striding through a plume of sculpted tear gas.

The crowd-sourced design was inspired by female protesters, in particular a young woman, believed to be a first aider, who was allegedly shot by police in the eye with a beanbag round during a pro-democracy demonstration last year.

The crowd-sourced design was inspired by female protesters, in particular a young woman, believed to be a first aider, who was injured in the eye by an alleged police beanbag round during a pro-democracy demonstration last year.

The work appeared at several rallies, but then its creators sought greater visibility: a location where the 4-meter-high (13 feet) artwork could perch as a mark of defiance.

So, during a hot and rainy night last October, a team of volunteers and professional climbers hauled the statue, which weighed 80-kilograms (176-pounds) without its base, up a steep mountain in parts: Eight people on the legs, another eight on the upper torso and head, two on the umbrella, three on the flag pole and additional helpers to direct the team up the intrepid and uneven course.

By dawn, ""Lady Liberty"" was assembled on Lion Rock, overlooking her besieged city and brandishing a flag reading ""Free Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.""

But not for long. The next day, the statue was toppled and spattered with red paint by unknown vandals.

Seven months later, she's back. And so is a potential threat to artistic expression, in the form of a national security law proposed by Beijing.

The law , which is expected to ban sedition, secession and subversion of China's central government, will be introduced through a rarely used constitutional method that could effectively bypass Hong Kong's legislature -- thus undermining the city's autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

What this means for the city's creative community is uncertain. But if China's attitude towards dissent on the mainland is any indicator, artists in Hong Kong could face blatant censorship, intimidation and even jail time for politically themed works.

Following a forced hiatus, brought about by citywide measures imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the pro-democracy movement has stirred in recent weeks.

The remnants of the original ""Lady Liberty Hong Kong"" are currently displayed on the second floor of a small cafe and exhibition space in the city's Sham Shui Po district -- hidden from street view to avoid attracting unwanted attention.

“ It symbolizes we are struggling, holding up pressure from up north, or from up top. ” Lady Liberty Hong Kong spokesperson

Along with these ""relics"" -- as the show's curators describe them -- a new, slightly altered version of the statue has been unveiled, an imposing floor-to-ceiling sculpture of ""Lady Liberty"" in typical protester attire. One fist is clenched, while the other hand is turned, palm up, to face the exhibition space's low ceiling.

""It symbolizes we are struggling, holding up pressure from up north (China), or from up top,"" said a spokesperson from the non-profit group, Lady Liberty Hong Kong , who would only give his code name Flash because, like other protesters, he is fearful of retribution.

That the show opened the same week Beijing announced its hugely controversial national security law is purely coincidental. Yet the proposed legislation is now a huge concern among some of the artists taking part.

""This kind of exhibition, if the law was passed, would not be allowed,"" argued Kacey Wong, whose work is featured in the show.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a press conference Tuesday that fears of strict new curbs on freedom of expression were unfounded, as the law is yet to be drafted. ""There is no need for us to worry because in the last 23 years whenever people worried about Hong Kong's freedoms of speech and freedoms of expressions and protest, time and again Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values.""

But many in the city feel differently.

In a leaderless and largely faceless movement, art hasconveyed protesters' fears and hopes. It has come in the form of ephemeral Lennon walls, which sprung up throughout the city (and were torn down just as quickly), as well as the countless memes, posters, flags and banners.

The pace at which designs are turned out and shared online is almost feverish -- and the images often contain details of the next protest and what to bring, or a record of the previous night's violent clashes.

Hong Kong's unique cultural identity has underpinned the pro-democracy movement's messaging, and has also been communicated visually through art and design.

""This movement has combined (different elements of) Cantonese culture -- the spoken language, the slang. You see a lot of characters, like Pepe the Frog, borrowed and transformed to fit the local context,"" said one of the curators of ""Yellow Objects,"" a recent exhibition showcasing 18 protest posters made by anonymous graphic designers.

""You can see how we incorporated our cross-cultural influences -- manga, the West, games, graffiti -- and how it reflects growing up in this international city,"" said the curator.

20,000 posters from the ""Yellow Objects"" exhibition -- such as this one, depicting a mother helping her son wear a helmet for a demonstration -- were distributed to the public, and plastered throughout the city.

Strangers have also reached across disciplines to create enduring symbols of protest. ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" a rousing song composed by a protester in his mid-20s, has become an unofficial anthem belted out by flash mobs and mass gatherings .

accompanying Anaccompanying music video , boasting a full orchestra and chorus, was created less than two weeks after the song's release and now has more than 4.6 million views on YouTube.

In keeping with the collective spirit of the movement, the works have been created by both amateurs and professionals -- mostly anonymously. And, in light of Beijing's new proposed law, perhaps with some degree of foresight.

“ The Chinese Communist Party is trying to generate fear. ” Kacey Wong, artist

""When the extradition bill was (first proposed), arts and cultural practitioners came out to express their opinions very early on, because it immediately threatened freedom of speech,"" said Clara Cheung, an artist, curator and newly elected councillor for Wan Chai district. The bill -- which would have allowed extradition to mainland China and sparked the large-scale protests -- was eventually withdrawn last September.

""Now we don't know how this (new proposed legislation) will work,"" Cheung added. ""Actually we don't believe in the legal system of mainland China, and there's no clear definition about national security. It's not clear at all. A worry of mine is, if it's passed, will they trace back activities done by artists?""

With so much of Hong Kong's contemporary art now centering around freedom, democracy and resistance, Beijing may consider it a significant threat.

Protest art has arguably fueled anti-mainland sentiments, while tirelessly ridiculing both Carrie Lam and Chinese president Xi Jinping depicting them as evil or inept caricatures. Given the expected broad scope of the proposed law, it would not be far-fetched to imagine that artists could -- alongside high-profile activists and lawmakers -- be targeted for acts deemed subversive against Beijing.

""The Chinese Communist Party is trying to generate fear,"" said Wong, urging fellow artists not to lose faith and to continue producing work amid perceived threats from the proposed new security law.

""Look at what is going on in mainland China. They (the artists) are still doing it, but in a super Morse code way ... all kinds of subversive language-based criticism. You'll still be able to decode it. That's the power of art.""

Silencing artistic expression

Even before last year's raging pro-democracy demonstrations, artists were creating political works with increasing fervor. Many wrestled with concerns about Chinese encroachment and its threat to Hong Kong's culture and way of life, as well as the 2047 deadline -- the year when the territory's half-century ""one country, two systems"" arrangement with Beijing, expires.

of creative protest, two artists lit up the facade of the International Commerce Center, the city's tallest skyscraper, with a nine-digit clock counting down by the seconds to July 1, 2047. The installation, titled ""Countdown Machine,"" was later In 2017, in one of the Hong Kong's most audacious displaysof creative protest, two artists lit up the facade of the International Commerce Center, the city's tallest skyscraper, with a nine-digit clock counting down by the seconds to July 1, 2047. The installation, titled ""Countdown Machine,"" was later pulled by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council.

“ You have to talk about politics in an indirect way, or you have to talk about something else. ” Sampson Wong, artist

Artists say self-censorship is already occurring -- particularly in publicly funded institutions and art initiatives. ""Local artists have the awareness that if you work with the Hong Kong government, you can already assume politics is not allowed,"" said Sampson Wong (no relation to Kacey), co-creator of the ""Countdown Machine."" ""You have to talk about politics in an indirect way, or you have to talk about something else.""

Significant events in Hong Kong's recent past, such as last year's protests and the 2014 Umbrella Revolution, are eerily absent in public spaces like the recently reopened Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA), which positions itself as representing the city's ""unique cultural legacy"" -- despite the proliferation of artworks created in both movements.

""At such a moment, it (the HKMoA) seems to exist in an isolated bubble,"" Wong noted. ""Even after its renovation, it's so outdated. It doesn't talk about society or politics. ""This type of dislocation is felt by artists and audiences. The formal art world is trying to figure out how to respond to the political climate of Hong Kong because if they don't respond, they will lose the public.""

While HKMoA did not respond to CNN's specific questions around self-censorship pressures and the absence of political art, the museum said in a statement that its exhibitions feature a selection of ""suitable art works"" that are ""based on criteria such as the themes of individual projects, artistic achievement of the artist as well as artistic merit of an artwork.""

The disconnect, until now, appeared to only pose an existential threat to Hong Kong's status as an international arts hub, which was built around the city's annual hosting of the Asian edition of Art Basel -- the world's largest art fair -- the influx of commercial art galleries, and the soon-to-open M+ Museum. A politically-engaged grassroots art movement has also grown in tandem.

How for example,might it affect the curation of the M+ museum's 1,500-strong collection of Chinese contemporary art (donated by Swiss collector Uli Sigg, and includes works by dissident artist Ai Weiwei ) remains to be seen.

In a statement to CNN, M+ said that the museum's ""curatorial autonomy and independence"" are safeguarded by a ""clear structure of governance and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Ordinance.""

Perhaps more pressing is the silencing effect the legislation may have on the city's artists. Wong said the ""Countdown Machine"" installation isn't something he would be comfortable creating in today's climate.

""It was lucky that (when) we did it four years ago, we only had some of the art world after us. If we did that work now, we would be in danger. The whole establishment would come after us.

""Right now whatever liberal thoughts, when they are associated with challenging the establishment (Beijing) ... I can foresee that artists and educators will be treated as the origin of revolutionary thoughts.""

411,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/yulia-tsvetkova-pornography-gay-propaganda-law-lgbtq-activism-russia/index.html,"In Russia, portraying women's bodies can get you arrested","Written by Valeria Costa-Kostritsky, CNN

Yulia Tsvetkova is unsure about her future. She has been criminally charged with the ""production and dissemination of pornographic materials,"" after sharing stylized depictions of vaginas on social media. The resident of a remote city in Russia's Far East, she was released from house arrest on March 16 after four months, but is still under strict travel restrictions and faces up to six years in jail.

Tsvetkova, 27, says that her trouble with the authorities started in early 2019. The youth theater group she had founded was scheduled to put on a play about gender stereotypes and another about militarism. Following pressure from the authorities, Tsvetkova ultimately canceled the play performances, and the festival they were featured in.

""I don't know which was worse for the authorities, the play about gender, which they don't understand, and they are afraid of, or the other play, which was pretty political, very sharp. I guess it's the combination of both that got me here,"" she said over a phone call. ""After that I was called to the police station every week or every other week,"" Tsvetkova said.

Tsvetkova's lawyer, Anna Plusnina, believes the police are deliberately harassing her client. ""I believe that the persecution began in February 2019, when Yulia decided to stage the play ""Blue and Pink"" (about gender stereotypes) in her city,"" said Plusnina in an email regarding these meetings with the authorities.

""Women who are alive have body fat and this is fine!"" A drawing by Tsvetkova Credit: From The Calvert Journal

""Over the next six months, Yulia and her mother were summoned to the city administration and for questioning by law enforcement agencies, before they could start a criminal case against Yulia in the summer of 2019,"" Plusnina continued. ""I believe that the goal is to limit her right to participate in cultural life and her right to free artistic expression.""

The Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Khabarovsk region in Russia's Far East did not respond to a request for comment.

The pornography charge came after the police discovered a group called ""The Vagina Monologues"" (named after Eve Ensler's play) that Tsvetkova founded and moderated on Russian social media network VKontakte, which encourages women ""to remove the stigma around the vagina and female physiology in general."" She says that she posted most of the content , which was all created by other people.

Tsvetkova, who lives in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in a part of Siberia that used to house Gulag labor camps, says police searched her apartment last November, and that they seized computer equipment and documents.

""There were lots of questions and then they found my work on the Internet and understood how they could make this case,"" she said. ""It's a pretty common scheme: the police search for what crime they can find in the activist's work and then open a case.""

She is currently forbidden to leave her town or change address and is waiting for a court date.

Not a new issue

The criminal charge that Tsvetkova is facing is not her first run-in with the police over art depicting women's bodies. They had previously investigated her own drawings, which were part of a body-positivity project called ""Women are not Dolls"" that Tsvetkova had also posted on VKontakte. The line drawings included messages like: ""Women who are alive have body fat and this is fine!"" and ""Women who are alive have muscles and this is fine!""

In January 2020, she was also charged under the so-called ""gay propaganda"" law, an administrative offense which can carry a hefty fine, for a drawing depicting two same-sex families with children, accompanied by the caption ""Family is where there's love. Support LGBT families!""

Across Russia, feminists and LGBTQ activists, who, in past years, have been emboldened by the country's version of the #metoo movement and by campaigns protesting violence against women and advocating for body positivity, have been vocal in their support for Tsvetkova.

On June 27, Russia's Youth Day (a national day of celebration), activists and publications posted a ""Media Strike for Yulia"" banner on their websites and social media platforms. An online poetry marathon was also held in her support.

Russian public figures have voiced their support for Tsvetkova, including actress Renata Litvinova, television host Ksenia Sobchak and veteran broadcaster Vladimir Pozner -- who made a video in which he says the case against Tsvetkova is unacceptable.

""Women who are alive have imperfect skin and this is fine!"" A drawing by Tsvetkova Credit: From The Calvert Journal

However Russia remains polarized on LGBTQ rights. The government has enacted anti-LGBTQ legislation, using laws to crack down on activists and LGBTQ rights supporters. This includes the use of the pornography law used against Tsvetkova, and, notably, the ""gay propaganda"" law, which bans ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations around minors,"" signed by Vladmir Putin in 2013, and condemned by the European Court of Human Rights as homophobic.

Meanwhile a recent referendum saw Russians voting in favor of proposed amendments to the constitution, one of which defines marriage as a union between a man a woman.

Ongoing support

Last week, Eva Tsvetkova (no relation to Yulia but a close friend and 28-year-old doctor) demonstrated in support of Yulia with 35 other women in Moscow.

""Yulia's case is important and political,"" she said via instant messenger. ""Because the charge of 'pornography' is a very obvious pretext for attacking people who disagree with the regime. Yulia has been involved in educational projects, in feminism, and importantly, she is a lesbian and she has been saying that LGBT+ people are citizens of this country just like everyone else -- an idea that our authorities oppose categorically.""

Along with 95 others, Anastasia Pyari, a 40-year-old journalist and poet who lives in Saint Petersburg, took part in the online poetry marathon in support of Tsvetkova. She recorded herself reading a poem in which she describes having sex with a woman. ""Many lesbians I know don't talk about their sexual orientation at work,"" she said over the phone. ""They say there's no need to make it public or to advocate it, but I think it's worth talking about, because if young women knew it was not shameful to be with another woman, many would lead happier lives.""

""Women who are alive have muscles and this is fine!"" A drawing by Tsvetkova Credit: From The Calvert Journal

""I'm proud of being part of what is happening right now, to see such a rise of awareness around these issues,"" Yulia Tsvetkova said. ""It was a shock for me when even the magazine ""Domashniy Ochag,"" (Good Housekeeping) which is for housewives, very traditional and very conservative, wrote about my case to support me.""

Ekaterina Zakharkiv, a literature Ph.D. student who co-organized the poetry marathon, is proud of having managed to explain Yulia's case to her grandmother. ""She agreed it's unfair. It was a big step for me. I took a photo of her standing in the middle of a field of flowers in her garden, holding a placard saying: 'If Yulia Tsvetkova is a criminal what does it say about (famous artists who paint nudes like) Boucher, Courbet and Rubens.'""

When asked what she thinks about all the support she has received, Tsvetkova says she is most touched when she hears from those, like her, who live in remote places. ""The most important actions that I see are happening not in Moscow, not in Saint Petersburg,"" she said. ""Some protests are happening in small towns where I know that protesters don't have the freedom or the safety that the community enjoys in Moscow, so they risk more, they sometimes risk their freedom for going to the street and saying, 'Freedom to Yulia Tsvetkova.'

""(This is happening) in Kirov, my mom's hometown, which is super conservative, and even in Komsomolsk,"" she continued. ""And for me that's something unbelievably touching because I know what it means to live in a small town and to be a feminist, how scary and lonely it might be.""

412,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/what-should-our-monuments-of-the-future-look-like-hank-willis-thomas/index.html,What should our monuments of the future look like?,"Written by Hank Willis Thomas

Hank Willis Thomas is an artist and the co-founder of the collective For Freedoms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

Monuments are critical tools in shaping the values and identity of society. Most of what we know about many ancient cultures -- Egypt, Great Zimbabwe, Greece, Rome -- are through public monuments. So we have to imagine that much of what future generations will know about us is through the monuments we choose to put up and preserve.

There isn't that much public space dedicated to contemplation. Many of the images and objects we see outside are advertisements that are directing us to buy something rather than asking us to reflect on something.

In two of the public sculptures that I've created, ""Unity,"" of an arm pointing skyward, at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City; and the forthcoming work, "" The Embrace ,"" a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, in Boston, I referenced incredibly common gestures that personify all of us.

""The Embrace"" is schedule to debut in Boston Common in 2022. The statue, dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, is about the ""power and intention behind an embrace what it means to hold and uplift one another,"" Willis Thomas said. Credit: Hank Willis Thomas

With ""Unity,"" my studio and I took a scan of the arm of an African immigrant athlete, Joel Embiid. There's poetry and a potency to a 22.5-foot-tall bronze arm of an immigrant pointing to the sky, echoing the gesture of the city's most famous monument, the Statue of Liberty. I hope it has a depth to it that will take greater meaning over time.

At their best, monuments become a locus -- a point around which people can gather and commune. I think many of the best public monuments we have in the United States are our rallying points. I went to high school in Washington D.C. and I remember being able to walk up to the Lincoln Memorial at one in the morning. I also grew up in New York City and my friends and I would meet up by ""Alamo,"" -- a sculpture also known as ""The Cube,"" in Astor Place, which has become a space to congregate since it was created in the 1960s.

In particular, I've always admired the sculptures of Swedish-American artist Claes Oldenburg, who could take any quotidian object, such as a garden spade or badminton birdie, and monumentalize it. In Philadelphia, where my mother is from, he made a colossal clothespin that sits outside of City Hall. But, his sculptures tend to be of Western, American, middle-class iconography. When I designed ""All Power to All People,"" of an afro pick with a raised fist, I wanted to make an object that spoke specifically to African Americans. In Philadelphia, where it exhibited for nine weeks in 2017, the black community has always been there, but it is rarely acknowledged and appreciated. The work is a symbol of unity, pride and self-care.

That work also sat just feet away from one of the most contentious statues in Philadelphia, of discriminatory former mayor and police commissioner Frank Rizzo. After 22 years, it was recently removed after protesters targeted it. The demands of the citizens were finally heard. When I created ""All Power to All People,"" I wanted it to offer an alternative to Rizzo's likeness, to show a design that celebrates community rather than killing it.

As we've watched monuments come down worldwide -- Confederate leader Jefferson Davis removed in Richmond, Virginia; Christopher Columbus statues beheaded and dismantled across the United States; slave trader Edward Colston toppled in Bristol, UK -- you can see what the public can do by just coming together and making a decision. We saw that with the Berlin Wall: People had had enough. I think that it's necessary to make that space for anger and frustration, but, as we move forward, rational reconsideration is really important, too.

Who are we today? What do we value today, as opposed to 200 years ago? We should give thought to not only what to do with the statues we take down -- in Budapest, for example, they have a park of disposed Communist-era statues -- but the lifespan of the new statues that we erect. We have limited public space as it is; maybe areas like Columbus Circle in Manhattan should be reimagined every so often. For the Colston statue in Bristol, over a century was long enough. There are other people, out of the billions who have been born since then, that we could celebrate in that square. Maybe we have to stop thinking that statues need to be forever.

We also have to consider the context of our existing monuments. My former professor, Robin DG Kelley, once discussed with me that during the American Civil War, the North may have been the victor, but the South won the narrative battle. The Confederacy only lasted four years, and yet over a century later there are still statues celebrating people who were traitors to the Union. I believe we may only be coming to the conclusion of the war now, 155 years later, as these statues are removed.

Public monuments have a higher charge now. They can celebrate a specific individual, or a group of people, but they should also invite a broader conversation about how a memorial can connect to the rest of the world and represent its people.

We should also remember that what we choose to hold onto is not necessarily as important as what we choose to forget. There are so many forgotten figures in history because they didn't have the best PR or simplest narrative to retell. Instead of celebrating grand, straightforward narratives, we should acknowledge the complexity of particular moments. It's our responsibility in the 21st century, when we have incredible access to information, to understand that there's never going to be one sufficient way of telling history -- it's really through embracing nuance that we can learn from the past."
413,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/kalki-subramaniam-opinion/index.html,"I'm on a mission to empower India's transgender community, one painted palm at a time","Written by Kalki Subramaniam

Kalki Subramaniam is a transgender rights activist, artist and founder of the Sahodari Foundation . The opinions in this article belong to the author.

I remember my childhood so vividly. Until the age of 11, I was a playful, happy child at home, and a good student at school.

Growing up in rural India, I was considered the more privileged child among my two sisters, having been born male. Yet, deep inside, I longed to be my true self.

I was a naturally effeminate child. I felt uncomfortable being addressed as ""he,"" and it seemed like there was this girl inside who liked everything a little girl of my age liked. This made me a constant target. But I didn't fear those big, bullying boys and would fight back, never ashamed of who I was.

Then, at the age of 14, I gave up. After I started losing interest in school, certain teachers became aggressive and would punish me with a cane. I could never tell my parents. Amid painful episodes of shame and self-doubt, I considered ending my own life, though my family's love stopped me from doing so.

I cut class and would go to parks and forests to get away from everyone. Under the trees, I wrote poetry and imagined my future life in drawings, which helped me heal my inner wounds.

""I with in"" by Kalki Subramaniam. Credit: Courtesy Kalki Subramaniam

When I finally came out as transgender to my parents, I was taken to a psychiatrist to help with my gender dysphoria, or the distress caused by the discrepancy between a person's body and their gender identity. He asked me to draw how I saw myself in the future, so I drew a beautiful girl with a long skirt, hat and a big smile. He was taken aback, but he eventually helped me gain my family's acceptance.

This is the dilemma faced by teen children with gender dysphoria. Unable to bear the bullying but terrified of disappointing their parents, they fear going to school and they fear dropping out, too. If they ""out"" themselves, only a few are accepted by their parents.

""The deepest wounds cannot heal until they are expressed. Practicing art helps us heal emotional injuries, by providing a safe opportunity for self-expression and shaping one's identity."" Kalki Subramaniam

When our families reject us, we find solace and refuge with other ""hijras"" who are also struggling to survive. In my lifetime, I have lost many transgender friends to suicide. Other friends died from AIDS.

As a teenager, I witnessed -- and was the victim of -- harassment. A transgender friend of mine, who was a sex worker, was raped by seven men. Another friend was chased by her own brother wanting to burn her. While another friend was driven out by her family. These childhood experiences built my raging desire for justice and inspired me to become an activist for the transgender community.

Healing through art

After completing my master's degree in journalism, I started a magazine called Sahodari (or ""sister"") to reach out to and support the transgender community. I used photographs, art and text to educate people about mental health, transitioning and their right to dignity.

Within a few years, I had founded the Sahodari Foundation and trained our team in visual storytelling.

Art has helped me identify my self-worth. It has been a medium for me to express my hope, joy, fear, anguish, desires and struggles. It is a reflection of my deep self that mirrors my journeys. It is a divine experience. When I paint, it is like my blood flows into the canvas and there is a soul connection. My artworks ""The Purple Princess"" and ""I with in"" celebrate the pure feminine and androgynous expressions with bright fluorescent colors. More recently, I have started to incorporate augmented reality into my artworks -- a technology that will help provide another level of meaning and emotional engagement with audiences.

Many people in the community are artistic and creative, but they seldom have the opportunity to practice their art. I realized that our community could not only express themselves through art, they could make a living from it. That is how our Transhearts project was born. I traveled with my team to several cities and small towns in south India to offer free workshops on expressive painting. It has been a therapeutic experience for the participants. When they are making art, they forget time.

We have exhibited the community's artworks in galleries, universities, colleges and public spaces. The reception had been tremendously positive. When people see the artwork they can identify and empathize with us.

Each piece of art tells a story. Abinaya's ""The Struggling Sex Worker"" was a moving work, very raw in portraying the exploitation of trans bodies. Viji D's ""Begging Cycle"" expresses the anguish of asking for money from strangers in trains to meet her basic needs. Nayanthara's ""Finding Oneself"" is beautiful, spiritual and powerful.

The deepest wounds cannot heal until they are expressed. Practicing art helps us heal emotional injuries, by providing a safe opportunity for self-expression and shaping one's identity. It can bring out our beautiful side. It can make us more tolerant of differences -- and of one another.

Standing up against violence

Sexual violence is a terrible, horrible, health-affecting issue that transgender people have endured for decades. Research from the Indian states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka found that four in 10 transgender people will experience some form of sexual abuse before the age of 18. Many of us remain silent victims.

The Red Wall Project was created to empower the voices of India's transgender and gender-diverse people, and to help resist the crimes perpetrated against us. It is a community ""art-ivism"" project whereby participants are interviewed by my team and write down their experiences of assault, abuse or rape on paper marked with their palm prints in red paint.

Listening to the experiences can be traumatizing, yet we are determined to do it. If we don't tell our community's stories, who will?

With their consent, we bring these stories to the public. During the exhibitions, I use my poetry and performance art to provoke dialogue about taking action against gender-based crimes.

Participants in the Red Wall project write their stories. Kalki sees the red painted palms signifying ""a slap against abusers and a sign of resistance."" Credit: Sahodari Foundation

The testimonials have been exhibited at the British council in Chennai, the Alliance Française in Trivandrum and various other educational and cultural institutions across India.

We want to reach out to India's young people with our stories, and tell them that it is unacceptable to hurt people based on their gender identity. Through victims' first-hand accounts, we can show them that we are human beings who deserve better treatment, respect and dignity.

Whenever we exhibit these testimonials, I see people reading them patiently for hours. I have seen visitors who, after reading, sit in silence in tears. Young people come to me and say, ""What can I do to stop this violence? How can I be supportive?"" And I tell them: ""Educate yourself more, sensitize your family and your friends to be trans-friendly. Empathize with us. That is all we need.""

Struggle for recognition

For decades, our community has struggled for acceptance and equality. In 2014, hard-fought battles led to a milestone victory when India's Supreme Court finally recognized transgender people as a ""third gender."" It was a move I had long lobbied the judiciary for, and the legal recognition meant, for instance, that people could enroll at academic institutions, as openly transgender, without fear.

Many corporations have started to hire transgender employees. Years of activism and awareness-building have resulted in many other welcome changes, including the positive portrayals of transgender people in mainstream media and films. In January 2020, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act came into effect, providing further legal protections of our rights and welfare.

There is still much work to be done. We are still fighting for affirmative action to ensure jobs and places at educational institutions. We want protection against stigma and discrimination, and legal guarantees that the punishments for crimes against transgender people will be severe.

But the rainbow is shining bright and beautiful. I see hope. I see a better future for our generation of queer Indians. I see India as a place that can uphold LGBTQI rights in the world. And I see India as a pioneer of transgender rights in the future."

Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola is known for her rich, textural portraits of black life, layered through intricate ballpoint pen, charcoal and pastel.

Born in 1985, Ojih Odutola is fundamentally a storyteller, influenced by the narrative traditions of her childhood. Her 2017 show at the Whitney Museum, her first solo exhibition in New York, unfolded a dual, interconnected narrative about two fictional aristocratic families in Nigeria.

More recently, when the Barbican Centre in London closed due to Covid-19 restrictions in March, it was just days before her first UK exhibition, "" A Countervailing Theory ,"" was set to open. Now, with the show postponed, Ojih Odutola has put together a virtual exhibition for New York's Jack Shainman Gallery, "" Tell Me a Story, I Don't Care If It's True ,"" made primarily of works created while the artist was at home over the past few months.

Her yet-to-be-seen Barbican show centers around myth-making and features 40 drawings based on an ancient legend, set in Nigeria, that the artist imagined herself. Her more intimate virtual show for Jack Shainman, meanwhile, focuses on solitary, free-flowing stories told through images and text.

Here, Ojih Odutola discusses both exhibitions, her rich exploration of black identity and how art can be a balm and a space for agency in a time of crisis.

CNN: Can you walk us through what your Barbican show will look like when it's unveiled?

Toyin Ojih Odutola: Some pieces are seven feet tall and some are really, really small. It's all based on a myth I wrote last year involving an ancient civilization and set in Plateau State in central Nigeria. For me, it was a need to delve into visual storytelling in a way that was engaging and different, and felt very present.

There are these striations throughout each drawing, and they may look like a decorative motif, but in fact, it's the system at work. When you see a drawing fully populated with these lines, you're seeing the system that is not spoken, not seen, but is everywhere in the world of these characters. It influences and affects them but they don't acknowledge it. It's just there. So of course it affects everything.

(The exhibition) deals with gender, power, hierarchies, oppression and imperialism in a way that I hope, once it's unveiled, is very subtle and nuanced and talks about the insidious nature of systemic oppression.

How did your new virtual exhibition, ""Tell Me a Story, I Don't Care If It's True,"" come about?

The title of the show came to me in February before lockdown. It was something that felt right and applicable to the time. It's a series of diptychs, standalone drawings and standalone text works. They're stories that came to mind, which was quite new for me because I tend to plan things a lot. This show was much more introspective.

These stories are anecdotal; they're isolated vignettes. There's not too much context, but just enough information to understand. There's a conversation happening between image and text. In one, you encounter a figure leaning against a couch, and you may have your ideas about what that figure is thinking -- the interiority of that moment. And then you read the text, and go back and forth between the two, and form your own meaning.

Viewership is an activity. Take a moment, take a beat. I hope that it's a way to question what you see and read.

Which oral or written traditions related to myths have influenced you?

I grew up in a household where the oratory was the means. Gathering around and hearing someone tell a tale is a huge part of Nigerian culture. I also grew up in a house with two amazingly funny parents who love to tell stories about anything. I've always treasured that. And it wasn't until I got much older that I realized how precious it was to have that experience and to have access to that.

When I first started my career, I was just drawing figures and not really thinking about narrative. But there's a wealth of knowledge that I already have in my own personal history and experience -- and I can apply that to a visual narrative and really help people see the possibilities of figurative work.

I'm heavily influenced by comic books and animation. For the Barbican show, engaging with epic mythology was my way of being completely free and creating something from scratch. Unlike ""Tell Me a Story, I Don't Care If It's True,"" there's no text (in the Barbican show) -- there's no reference for the audience, and everything is otherworldly and strange. But what I hope is that as they walk through that space, they start to acclimate themselves to my visual language.

You often explore the texture and meaning of skin in your work. How has this evolved with your practice?

Initially I wanted to figure out a way to visually translate what skin felt like. I use sinewy lines; it's very layered, and I was mostly doing ballpoint pen ink works. And then I began including other drawing materials like charcoal and pastel, and now, most recently, colored pencil and graphite.

Ojih Odutola compares black skin to water, calling it ""a mercurial surface, a terrain...a place where so much beauty and positivity proliferates."" Credit: Toyin Ojih Odutola/Barbican

When I think about the surface of skin I think about the work of multimedia artist Roni Horn, who uses water as a metaphor for a surface that's ambiguous and ever-changing. I think about skin in a very similar light. Skin is a terrain. It's a landscape that you project meanings onto. It has its own history.

When I look at black skin, I think of it as a mercurial surface -- a terrain, a construct, a projection, but also a place where so much beauty and positivity proliferates. It includes so much and it holds so much.

Following the death of George Floyd, there's been so much conversation about black trauma, depictions of black people in the media and how those images are circulated. How do you think art can play a role at this time?

There's a lot of noise -- images can be noisy. But with art, it's just you and this work. You're in dialogue with it, and there's no right or wrong way to engage. Art provides the opportunity for people to be still, to think and digest this moment and try to understand it.

I have made a pact with myself, as an image-maker, that if I am going to contribute images to the plethora of those available on the internet that I will not show black pain, deaths or trauma.

That's my choice. And if you are an artist who does deal with those things, fine. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but for me it's very important that I provide images and texts that give people something else to engage with because we already know that trauma and pain is a sad and unfortunate thing that connects black people globally.

Black people are catalysts. In every society we've been a part of, our culture has left an indelible mark. That is no accident. And so we shouldn't always think that we're coming from a place of lack, that we are powerless. I'm not saying that these aren't realities. But it's not how we should read ourselves as a community, as a collective (and) as a diverse, brilliant diaspora.

And as someone who's a part of the diaspora, I want to give people space to engage with potential, to engage with our capabilities. Yes, they are afraid of us because they don't know what we're capable of. But we should not be afraid of what we are capable of."
415,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-song-dance/index.html,How North Korea's ideology is built on song and dance,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

""So dear to all our hearts is our General's glorious name; our own beloved Kim Il Sung of undying fame,"" go the lyrics to one of North Korea's best-known songs, ""Song of General Kim Il Sung,"" which honors the country's founding ruler and eternal president.

""Tell blizzards that rage in the wild Manchurian plains,"" it continues. ""Tell, you nights in forests deep where the silence reigns.""

It's a triumphant marching song that ethnomusicologist Keith Howard has heard countless times since he first visited North Korea in 1992. Universally known across the country, it is played on news broadcasts and sung by schoolchildren. Howard even saw the lyrics etched onto rocks along mountain paths in order to inspire walkers.

""It really sets out who Kim Il Sung is, and celebrates him as the person who fought the Japanese single-handedly and then got rid of them -- which is the authorized picture of what happened,"" said Howard, a professor at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, in a phone interview.

""It's much more important than the national anthem, because the national anthem is essentially what you play to foreigners, whereas this is what you sing in (North) Korea.""

Despite dedicating years of research to the hermit kingdom's musical traditions, Howard admitted that his work involves listening to an excessive number of ""mind-numbing"" songs that ""you probably wouldn't want to listen to for more than five minutes."" But his new book "" Songs for 'Great Leaders '"" is not simply a survey of music, dances and instruments -- it's an exploration of how they reflect and reinforce the state's ideology.

If, as Howard's book suggests, North Korea ""behaves as if its whole territory is a theater,"" then it is one alive with song and dance. And given country's strict control over creativity, they are almost exclusively used as instruments of propaganda -- from the country's ""mass games,"" in which thousands of people perform in perfect unison, to school classrooms, where children are taught a repertoire of approved songs from an early age.

Music's evolving role

It's a story the British professor traces back to the 1930s, when Korea was still under Japanese rule. As well as introducing new styles of music, Japan dominated East Asia's recording industry, and Korea's professional musicians would often have to travel to studios in Tokyo and Kyoto in order to record. It was also in this era that communist guerrillas, who resisted colonial rule, began adapting -- and often directly copying -- songs from the region's other revolutionary groups.

""North Korea would deny this, and say the revolutionary songs were totally independent and written by people close to Kim Il Sung,"" said Howard. ""But they all, to us, sound exactly the same as the equivalent ones from China or the Soviet Union.""

By the time Kim Il Sung -- grandfather of current leader, Kim Jong Un -- seized power in 1948 following the division of Korea, he set about reshaping its arts traditions. In a 1955 speech , he said that his country had ""failed to take measures for a systematic study of our country's history and national culture,"" and called for ""every effort (to) be made to unearth our national legacies and carry them forward.""

Instead of creating new state songs from scratch, Kim sent musicologists out to the countryside to document the folk music and poems already known to many people. Despite millennia of shared culture on the Korean peninsula, Kim prioritized songs that originated from the north. He then ordered them to be recast using socialist themes, their lyrics rewritten to serve political ends.

By the late 1960s, the leader's then-young son Kim Jong Il had ""taken the reigns of artistic production,"" Howard explained. This period saw the arts play an increasingly important role in the construction of national identity, with new operas, cantatas and stage productions recounting and glorifying the country's past.

Chief among them are the so-called Five Great Revolutionary Operas, which offer revisionist takes on North Korea's history, alongside communist messages and celebrations of the country's leaders.

The first of them, 1971's ""The Sea of Blood,"" tells the tale of a peasant who overcomes Japanese brutality before joining the guerrilla fight against her oppressors. ""The Flower Girl,"" meanwhile, charts the struggles of a family indebted to a ruthless landowner, in a searing critique of pre-communist feudalism.

These productions ""enshrine everything you're supposed to know"" about the country's foundations, Howard said. ""They're fairly dark in terms of lighting and (storylines) -- until the very end. Then, in the last 10 minutes, there's a section where everything becomes light, and it's the light of Kim Il Sung who has triumphed and rebuilt Korea.""

Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea after his father's death in 1994, is also responsible for expanding the country's mass spectacles -- highly choreographed performances involving tens of thousands of singers, dancers and gymnasts. Usually performed at the world's largest stadium, Pyongyang's May Day Stadium, the shows tell North Korea's story in an impressive display of color and coordination.

But, beyond the obvious, the shows promote collectivism in unseen ways, explained Howard, who said the choreography is often ""deliberately complicated.""

""It could be a lot simpler,"" he said. ""(But the routines) are made complicated to the extent that if one person goes wrong, the whole team -- the whole setup -- will collapse.""

As Kim Jong Il himself told the producers of mass performances in 1987, ""The schoolchildren, conscious that a single slip in their action may spoil their mass gymnastic performance, make every effort to subordinate all their thoughts and actions to the collective.""

Musical monopoly

The idea that an authoritarian regime might use music and dance as tools is hardly a novel one.

After all, almost every society institutionalizes songs that evoke shared values, national myths and historical events, from ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" to ""London Bridge is Falling Down.""

But the monopoly North Korea exerts over creative expression makes the state's songs -- and thus their approved messages -- uniquely pervasive.

How North Korea creaties the illusion of prosperity through architecture

""There's no evidence that people are creating any of their own music outside of what's centrally allowed,"" Howard said. ""The only recording company is state-owned, and there are no performances that would be permitted outside what's authorized.

""You don't even have the right to create new words (to existing songs), and if you did, you'd have to be incredibly careful, because if they were deemed to be inappropriate you'd be in trouble.""

The government's approach to music appears to have evolved in recent years. North Korea's first contemporary girl group, Moranbong Band, debuted in 2012, the year after present-day leader Kim Jong Un became supreme leader. Perhaps influenced by the illicit arrival of pop culture from South Korea (smuggled in on DVDs or, more recently, flash drives), the band offers something comparatively contemporary.

Its members wear makeup and are dressed ""slightly provocatively,"" as Howard put it. They are also pictured using instruments made by brands like Yamaha and Roland, whereas pop predecessors like Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble (which, in the 1980s, became the country's first group to use electric guitars and synthesizers) had logos from capitalist countries hidden or removed.

Nonetheless, the lyrical content remains much the same. Moranbong Band may look like the North's answer to K-pop, but its songs still center on praising the country's leadership and military achievements.

Such strict controls mean that, as a rule, North Korean music makes for repetitive listening, Howard said. The state-sanctioned songs -- even to someone with a deep understanding of their context, arrangements and instrumentation -- can end up sounding much alike.

Yet, variety is in the ear of the beholder. It's a point the ethnomusicologist demonstrated with an anecdote from a trip to North Korea in which he complained to his government minder about the ""boring"" music played each day in their car.

""The guide said to me, 'Ooh I'll bring you something completely different tomorrow,"" Howard recalled. ""The next day he arrived with two cassettes of children's songs. But it was just children singing the adult songs -- exactly the same, but done by children.

""We then had a fascinating discussion where he tried to persuade me they were totally different."""
416,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/natural-history-museum-whitewashing-monuments-statues-trnd/index.html,People are calling for museums to be abolished. Can whitewashed American history be rewritten?,"Written by Brian Boucher, CNN

After years of resisting calls for its removal, New York's American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) has asked the city to dislodge from its front steps an equestrian monument to Theodore Roosevelt, the twenty-sixth US president, which depicts him charging forward, and towering over two mostly nude figures, one Black and one Indigenous.

In a statement dated June 2020 sent to museum staff, posted on the museum's website, Ellen Futter, president of the institution's board, said, ""As we strive to advance our institution's, our City's, and our country's passionate quest for racial justice, we believe that removing the statue will be a symbol of progress and of our commitment to build and sustain an inclusive and equitable Museum community and broader society."" (After the announcement President Donald Trump tweeted, ""Ridiculous, don't do it!"")

Might this concession be a harbinger of other changes ahead for American museums? How can institutions whose leadership is often overwhelmingly White rethink their staffing, collections and exhibitions, much less move toward more truly equitable governance? Or, some ask, should museums continue to exist in anything like their current form?

The Natural History Museum's statement places the monument's removal in the context of ""the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd,"" a Black man who was killed by four police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, one of whom knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. After a video of Floyd's killing went viral, tens of thousands took to the streets in protest in the US and around the world, even in the midst of a pandemic, to demand accountability for police brutality and to call for the defunding, or even the abolition of local police forces, among other demands.

The presence of an Indigenous figure in the Roosevelt monument, and the museum itself, have a very personal meaning for Wendy Red Star, an artist and member of the Crow tribe. She created a project, ""The 1880 Crow Peace Delegation,"" about a group of Crow chiefs who traveled to Washington, DC, that year to try to negotiate a peace treaty. In researching for the project, she found that the remains of one of those chiefs, Pretty Eagle, had been stolen from a burial site and later sold to the AMNH. The tribe was able to repatriate the remains in the 1990s.

""It wasn't until I did this project that I learned about that,"" Red Star said in a phone interview. ""The Roosevelt monument was the first thing I thought of. To me, it's a really direct connection to how my people have been presented at the museum -- along with the dinosaur bones as part of the natural world. It's always been such a surreal experience to see my community's objects on display and watch people observing them as if these were peoples of the past.""

Just as government, law enforcement, and all forms of authority are being questioned in this moment of upheaval, museums worldwide have come in for intense scrutiny, and the situation on the ground is changing very fast. Earlier this month, dozens of current and former staffers of multiple cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art as well as institutions nationwide, published an open letter accusing the institutions of unfair treatment of employees of color and saying that ""your covert and overt white supremacy that has benefited the institution, through the unrecognized dedication and hard labor of Black/Brown employees, with the expectation that we remain complacent with the status quo, is over.""

Within days, staffers at the Guggenheim and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art openly accused the institutions' leadership of racism. In an emailed statement to CNN, Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, said the institution was prepared to address these concerns:

""As a society, we are confronting sustained injustices never resolved, and feel today the pain and anger of previous moments of turmoil. The Guggenheim addresses the shared need of great reform, and long overdue equality, and want to reaffirm that we are dedicated to doing our part.

""In this period of self-reflection and reckoning, we will engage in dialogue with our staff and review all processes and procedures to lead to positive change,"" he continued. ""We are expediting our ongoing ... efforts to produce an action plan for demonstrable progress.""

The Metropolitan Museum declined to comment. The Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art did not respond to requests for comment.

Museums have also been critiqued for issuing anodyne statements that failed to mention Floyd or the Black Lives Matter movement. The Getty Museum, in Los Angeles, posted an unspecific call for ""equity and fairness"" on Instagram, and later apologized ; the director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art privately apologized to Black artist Glenn Ligon for using a work of his from the museum's holdings on social media without his permission, according to the New York Times.

The AMNH's statement does not mention the groups that have for several years organized protests calling for the Roosevelt monument's removal. In a phone interview, Decolonize This Place (DTP) organizer Amin Husain pointed out that removal of the monument was just one of three demands that Decolonize had placed on the museum, which include internally renaming Columbus Day as Indigenous People's Day and rethinking the museum's displays.

""Many of the museum's galleries contain Indigenous remains and objects,"" he said. ""Those things need to be sent back to the people they were taken from, and the exhibitions must be completely overhauled in consultation with, and with the active participation of, the relevant stakeholders.""

While many U.S. museums have made moves toward what the field calls ""diversity, equity, and inclusion,"" fellow DTP organizer Marz Saffore called for much greater change. ""It's critical that we move past identity politics,"" she said. ""It's not enough to hire an Indigenous curator. It's not enough to have one Black person on your board. Museums as we know them have to be abolished. I don't want my voice to be added to museums that are often trophy cases for Imperialism.""

Institutions like the AMNH will continue to be sites for debate, some of which may echo heated arguments among historians and activists on how to handle monuments to objectionable historical figures. This includes leaders of the Confederate Army in the US Civil War, which were erected by Confederate sympathizers oftentimes decades after the war, with a conscious white supremacist purpose

Some ask whether these monuments could, rather than being destroyed or removed, be altered by, for example, adding contextualizing information. In an interview with National Public Radio on Tuesday about the Roosevelt monument, historian Manisha Sinha suggested that this tribute to Roosevelt's efforts toward nature conservation could still stand, if the subjugated Black and Indigenous figures were simply removed. (DTP pointed out in an emailed statement that the land Roosevelt ""conserved"" was stolen from Indigenous people, so they would hardly find that an acceptable solution.)

By contrast, Abraham Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, former public affairs czar for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and author of books including ""Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion"" (2014), wrote an editorial this month for the New York Daily News saying that while he had earlier asked whether Confederate monuments could be altered, he'd concluded that they must be removed. ""I was not only wrong,"" he wrote; ""I was insensitive.""

Michael Diaz-Griffith, executive director of the New York-based Sir John Soane's Museum Foundation, which supports the Soane Museum in London, is author of ""The Anti-Racist Preservationist's Guide to Confederate Monuments: Their Past and a Future Without Them,"" a pamphlet that succinctly explains how such monuments have a foundation in white supremacy, and outlines why they should be struck from the public realm. ""In the case of the Confederates there's no public legacy to detach from their wrongdoing,"" Diaz-Griffith said over the phone.""The Confederacy was an immoral enterprise.""

Diaz-Griffith envisions a future, sooner or later, free of tributes to any such contentious figures.

""I think that all named buildings, all named places, will end up being reevaluated,"" he said. ""Who should they be named after? Do we continue to focus on those who were recognized in their own times, or do we shift our attention to those who fought for justice but weren't publicly honored when they were alive? Since all people are fallible, it may be a good idea to erect monuments to principles, like justice, rather than to individuals.""

US museums, dependent as they are on the largesse of wealthy individuals and families, are far from a future in which controversial donors, who, for instance, hold views that run counter to science, nonetheless have galleries or other features named for them. The AMNH itself was under scrutiny for taking money from Rebekah Mercer, a major donor to the Republican party, whose leader Donald Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change during his time in office. Mercer left the board when her term ended in 2019. Meanwhile in 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named the revamped plaza on Fifth Avenue for donor David H. Koch, likewise a Republican donor, who is notable for funding efforts to undercut climate change science.

But the activists who had called for the removal of the Roosevelt monument have more foundational questions in mind than who funds such cultural organizations. Representing the group NYC Stands with Standing Rock, Sandy Grande, using the Lenape people's name for Manhattan, said in a phone interview, ""We should underscore that the city (Mannahatta) wouldn't exist without the land and labor of Black and Indigenous peoples. This is Lenape land and the Mohawk and Seneca peoples built much of the city. In addition to Black people's labor, their settlement at Seneca Village was destroyed.""

""So,"" she said, ""the removal of the monument has been a long time coming, not just for the museum but for the city itself, and we will continue to press for change.""

""This is an historic moment -- a pause and reflect moment for individuals and institutions,"" said Makeba Clay, the chief diversity officer at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, over email. ""The systemic and unrelenting injustices against members of the Black community have existed for hundreds of years and continue to exist all around us, including in our museums. We know we have work to do and that means being actively anti-racist -- not passively non-racist.""

Clay was the inaugural appointee to her role, which she took on in 2018 and her message is that it's not enough to ""amplify"" voices and messages, art institutions must take action. ""We are looking at our staff and board, both overwhelmingly white, and actively examining our hiring and recruitment processes to promote greater diversity,"" she said. ""We recently held a town hall, which uncovered stark differences between staff of color and white staff.""

Clay also said that art does not exist outside struggle. That while it can be used for ""constructive discourse, building empathy and creating community,"" art also ""can confront current issues and topics that aren't neutral.""

Adding: ""What appears like radical action is exactly what museums need to pursue to prove that they have a valuable role to play in this national discourse.""

417,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/hong-kong-tunnels-climate-crisis-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,Hong Kong's vast $3.8 billion rain-tunnel network,"The city's complex drainage system protects Hong Kong from once-disastrous flooding caused by seasonal typhoons. But will it be strong enough to withstand the effects of climate crisis?

Below the mountains that overlook Hong Kong's financial district, drainage engineer Alex Lau is ankle-deep in water flowing into a giant tunnel almost twice the height of a double-decker bus.

Part of a ground-breaking, $3.8 billion (30 billion Hong Kong dollar) drainage network, this tunnel runs nearly the length of Hong Kong Island and has saved the city from floods that decades ago routinely cost lives and caused widespread destruction.

""This tunnel intercepts about one third of the rainfall for the northern Hong Kong area,"" Lau says, as he looks west to the point where the tunnel fades to black. ""We have about 34 intakes and all the intercepted water will be diverted into the tunnel and carried all the way to the sea.""

Dug with two vast tunnel-boring machines over five years, beginning in 2007, the 10.5-kilometer-long (6.5 mile) tunnel, about half the length of Manhattan, has solved a basic but pressing problem facing one of Asia's wettest cities: rain. Hong Kong receives about 2,400 millimeters it per year, according to the Drainage Services Department (DSD). And about 80% of that water falls in just a few months.

But building this network in one of the world's densest cities wasn't easy.

Hong Kong Island was already criss-crossed by tunnels, carrying the city's subway system and accommodating roads that slice through the mountainous landscape.

Consequently, the Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel runs through the hills behind the city, tucked less than a dozen meters below the surface -- though few of the city's residents, whose lives it protects each rainy season, ever realize it is there.

Engineers had to shore up insecure ground above the tunnel to prevent water seeping through and causing parts of it to collapse. To tackle the difficulty of building tunnel intakes -- pipes and entrances leading to the main drain -- in dense urban areas, the decided to dig upwards from the tunnels and then extract gravel and debris that fell down out of the subterranean network to avoid causing too much disruption at street level.

Frequent flooding

A true Hong Kong summer can be a test of any resident's love for the city. Stiflingly hot and humid, from June to September, high temperatures are only broken by typhoons and rainstorms, during which the city endures torrential downpours that render umbrellas useless.

On June 7, 2008, more than 145 millimeters (5.7 inches) poured down on the city in 24 hours. That's more than what Seattle, Washington receives most months. Photos from the storm show people trudging through knee deep water, and at least two people were killed in landslides caused by the torrential downpour. Credit: MIKE CLARKE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images

Hong Kong has a color-coded warning system for rainstorms, from amber to black, issued by the Observatory and sent to millions of residents' mobile phones. Building on a system introduced in 1967 , the alerts warn people when to avoid unnecessary travel due to the danger of road accidents, or even landslides caused by rain in some mountainous parts of the city.

Offices and schools shut during black rain, which is defined as when more than 70 millimeters (2.7 inches) per hour. While black rain causes minor flooding -- mainly due to the impermeability of tarmac and concrete -- thanks to the giant underground tunnels, it is nothing compared to the past.

The deadliest typhoon hit the city in September 1906, killing an estimated 15,000 people, according to Hong Kong Observatory , 5% of the city's then population of 320,000. In the 1960s and 70s, Hong Kong suffered hundreds of fatalities due to tropical cyclones. Thousands also lost their homes due to flooding, and the city had to spend millions on water damage repairs every year.

Heavy urbanization only made flooding worse, as large areas of natural ground were paved over, swapping soluble grass and mud for concrete and tarmac, which rather than absorb rain, allowed water to accumulate in puddles or, worse, cause flood. Older areas of the city were also compromised, with drainage systems built for a far smaller population and to poor standards.

Since 1995, the department has spent around $3.8 billion on various projects. That has included installing 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) of drains, 360 kilometers (224 miles) of river channels, four vast underground tunnels spanning 21 kilometers (13 miles), and four stormwater storage tanks. Another 11 tanks are being constructed.

The Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel is the largest of four, and runs through the mountains above Tin Hau, in the eastern part of the island, past the busy financial districts of Admiralty and Central, to Cyberport on the western coast. At its widest, the tunnel is 7.25 meters in diameter.

It slopes gradually downward so the water is carried out by gravity, though pumps can also be engaged for heavy flow. Even on a dry day, water streams down a nearby intake from high above in the mountains. The intake looks like an artificial waterfall made of concrete steps designed to slow down the flow. Far from smelling like a drain, the water heading into the tunnel has little aroma, and looks a river.

Other solutions in Hong Kong are tailored to the district. So, rural villages and towns can be protected with dykes and channels dug to redirect or temporarily store the water, while heavily built-up, urban areas require more intensive engineering work.

These solutions, which direct rainwater away from vulnerable areas and eventually return it to the ocean, have helped to reduce the number of flooding blackspots from 126 in 1995, to just five today.

Richard Leung, the DSD's senior engineer, won't be drawn on whether all this has been value for money, but for context, flooding in southern China led to economic losses of more than $2.9 billion (20 billion RMB) in June alone

Racecourse storage

One of the largest storage tanks in Hong Kong lies beneath one of its best-known landmarks: the Happy Valley Racecourse, where, before coronavirus, tens of thousands of gamblers bet on weekly horse races. Hundreds more use the grounds as an outdoor running track, football pitch, and rugby field during the rest of the week.

""You would never know this was here from the outside,"" Lau says inside the tank. The concrete floor is streaked with mud and dotted with small puddles. Small stones, silt and leaves are partially lit by fluorescent lights that do little to illuminate the darkness.

The chamber looks like a vast, empty underground car park. At its fullest, it can hold up to 60,000 square meters of water, or the equivalent to 24 standard swimming pools.

It protects some of the most expensive real estate in the city from flooding, not least the racecourse itself, which prior to the tank's creation in 2012 was regularly inundated with rain, destroying the turf and requiring expensive repairs.

Happy Valley is also indicative of the DSD's future plans to recycle rainwater citywide. Some of the water that falls on the racecourse is collected and reused, for irrigation and to flush toilets in nearby housing estates.

Changing climate

The achievement of Hong Kong's anti-flood strategy cannot be overstated. Combined with the city's typhoon warning and protection systems -- such as storm surge barriers -- it has made weather that is disastrous in many other parts of southeast Asia a mere annoyance for most Hong Kongers.

Every year during the summer rains, storms that wash over Hong Kong, their deluge diverted by the tunnels and stored in tanks, can devastate parts of neighboring Guangdong by destroying buildings.

Hong Kong is not alone in dealing with flooding effectively, and the city's engineers regularly collaborate with international and regional partners to share best practices and solutions. That is becoming ever more important as the changing climate brings more unpredictable and dangerous weather.

After Typhoon Mangkhut battered the city in 2018, the Hong Kong Observatory's senior scientific officer Ping-Wah Li told CNN , ""rain from tropical cyclones will increase ... and sea levels will continue to rise, increasing the threat of storm surges and coastal inundations,"" due to global warming.

Edward Ng, professor of architecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that some work had been done to bolster Hong Kong defenses, but that ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" are needed to properly defend the coast.

""The design standard is based on past history,"" he said in a previous interview. ""It can cope with what happened thirty years ago, but not with what will happen in the next fifty years.""

Leung, the DSD senior engineer, is also wary of being caught out by complacency, saying the city's current defenses are sufficient only at present, and may be surpassed in the future.

As well as continuing with engineering works like building tanks and tunnels, he believes adjustments to the city's design and architecture can help combat the risks of climate change.

Those design solutions could include porous pavements, protected wetlands, rain gardens, and green rooftops, all of which can help absorb rainfall. So-called ""sponge cities"" have already been trialed in China , with some success.

Even as the climate crisis leads to rising sea levels and serious flooding in some parts of the world, it is also having a major effect on global water resources, with the number of countries dealing with extreme water crises growing.

Leung said that in cities like Hong Kong that are inundated with rainfall, there needs to be a reimagining of how to deal with water. Beyond just intercepting and diverting it, there should be more tactics for storing, purifying and reusing it, thus reducing the pressure on existing water resources.

At present, some rain is collected and reused for irrigation and flushing water, but most is still dumped back into the sea, a bitter situation for a city that imports over 70% of its fresh water from across the border in mainland China. With rising temperatures potentially leading to greater water-insecurity around the world, Hong Kong's ability to do more with the water that literally falls upon it is more important than ever.

""In the past, we just discharged, but now we're talking about using the water as much as possible,"" Leung said. ""We don't know exactly how it is changing, but we know the climate is changing, so we have to be prepared.""

418,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/cities-design-coronavirus/index.html,Our cities may never look the same again after the pandemic,"From Auckland to Bogota, urban planners are already adapting our cities to lockdown. But will the changes last, and which more radical design proposals -- be it sewer monitors or ""epidemic skyscrapers"" -- will shape the post-pandemic city?

Our cities may never look the same again after the pandemic

For advocates of walkable, unpolluted and vehicle-free cities , the past few weeks have offered an unprecedented opportunity to test the ideas they have long lobbied for.

With Covid-19 lockdowns vastly reducing the use of roads and public transit systems, city authorities -- from Liverpool to Lima -- are taking advantage by closing streets to cars, opening others to bicycles and widening sidewalks to help residents maintain the six-foot distancing recommended by global health authorities.

In Oakland, California, almost 10% of roadways have been closed to through-traffic, while Bogota , Colombia, has opened 47 miles of temporary bike lanes. New York has begun trialing seven miles of ""open streets"" to ease crowding in parks, with Auckland Mexico City and Quito among the dozens of other world cities experimenting with similar measures.

There are many purported benefits of ""reclaiming"" the streets during a pandemic. Encouraging cycling may reduce crowding on buses and subways, where people can struggle to get distance from one another. Vehicle-free roads also offer those without access to parks the ability to exercise safely.

Other urban initiatives have been introduced to directly control the spread of the virus. Cities in the US, Canada and Australia have reconfigured traffic lights so that people no longer need to touch crosswalk buttons. (In any case, many pedestrian crossings are equipped with "" placebo buttons "" that have no impact on whether the lights go green).

It is unclear if these urban interventions will continue once the pandemic is over. Milan plans to build 22 miles of new cycle lanes and permanently widen sidewalks after its lockdown lifts. Authorities in Hungary's capital, Budapest, have suggested that its new bike lanes may become permanent if the measures ""prove favorable,"" while planning officials in Providence, Rhode Island, have said crossings will now remain button-free

But few other cities have been so committal. And it will be harder to make the case for pedestrian- and cycle-friendly streets once their benefits are weighed against the knock-on effects of congestion elsewhere -- especially in countries as dependent on cars as the US.

Indeed, the cities in which pandemic-era measures seem most likely to stick are those already committed to change. Take Paris, for instance, where more than 400 miles of pop-up bike lanes (or ""coronapistes"") are set to open when France's national lockdown ends on May 11. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has called returning to a car-dominated status quo ""out of the question,"" but she was already backing a huge overhaul of biking in the city.

In other words, the pandemic may only have served as a catalyst. But urban planning is a long game in which change is piecemeal and the legacies of past decisions take time to overcome. Public spaces and amenities cannot always be expanded or reconfigured at will.

So, looking to the coming years rather than the coming months, how else might the virus -- or attempts to prevent future ones -- re-shape our cities?

Reimagining public space

Parc de la Distance, a speculative proposal by Austrian design studio Precht, imagines a public park made from a maze-like network of three-foot-wide hedges. The layout provides 20-minute walking routes that can, in theory, be completed while maintaining distance from others, thanks to gates indicating when paths are occupied.

Austrian design studio Precht has imagined a maze-like public park that encourages social distancing.

Czech firm Hua Hua Architects has meanwhile proposed a "" Gastro Safe Zone "" (pictured top) which uses brightly colored ground markings to encourage passersby to keep their distance from al fresco diners. And in Milan, one of the cities worst hit by Covid-19, designer Antonio Lanzillo has envisaged public benches equipped with plexiglass ""shield"" dividers

Other ideas have ranged from self-disinfecting ""smart"" elevators to door handles that can be easily operated with elbows , rather than hands.

It is too soon to know which, if any, may be realized. But each idea suggests that the practice of social distancing and unease over shared surfaces could continue long after the current crisis.

“ Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around. So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed? Can we still achieve connectivity if we all keep social distancing? ” Jordi Honey-Rosés

If they do, the widely-publicized six-foot distancing guidelines could redefine the layout and spacing of new public facilities, according to Northeastern University's Sara Jensen Carr, whose forthcoming book "" The Topography of Wellness "" considers how urban landscapes have been transformed by epidemics like cholera, tuberculosis and obesity.

""Everybody from Daniel Burnham -- who was the planner of Chicago -- to Le Corbusier came up with arbitrary measurements on their own,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Le Corbusier writes extensively that every 'unit' in the Radiant City (or ""Ville Radieuse,"" the celebrated architect's proposed utopia) needed a specific amount of light ... and a certain amount of cubic feet of air to circulate within it.

""So six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks.""

Yet, the idea of keeping people apart seems to contradict the emphasis planners have traditionally placed on human interaction. Architects, whether designing parks or social housing, have often valued meeting points as sources of collaboration, inclusion and community-building.

""That contradiction is very interesting,"" said associate professor at the University of British Columbia, Jordi Honey-Rosés, who co-authored one of the first academic studies into the potential impact of Covid-19 on public space.

""In fact, if you look at the literature on the health benefits of green spaces, one of the primary (advantages) is social connectivity -- people seeing their neighbors and being part of a community.

""Planners talk about creating 'sticky' streets -- places where people linger and stay around,"" he added, speaking on the phone from lockdown in Barcelona. ""So the question now is: Will those efforts continue, or how will they need to be changed? Can we still achieve connectivity if we all keep social distancing?""

Rather than outlining solutions at this early stage, Honey-Rosés' paper (which, subject to peer review, is set to publish in the journal Cities & Health) instead lays out the questions facing urban planners. Many relate to how cities manage the green spaces that he thinks ""will, overall, be more valued and more appreciated"" after the current crisis.

In addition to their well-documented health and psychological benefits, greener cities may also be more resilient to future pandemics. A recent Harvard study has indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in the US, while Italian scientists have detected the virus on pollutant particles (and are looking at whether pollution may aid its spread).

Neither line of inquiry has yielded conclusive results. But should a definitive link between pollution and the virus emerge, it would ""really be a game-changer"" for green urban planning, Honey-Rosés said.

""Then, cities will be able to say, 'We're going to redesign our streets not only because we need social and physical distance, but because we need to increase our probability of survival,"" he suggested.

A matter of density

The biggest questions may center around population density. Fears that disease spreads more easily in busy urban centers could already be having an impact on people's attitudes towards living in cities.

indicated that respondents aged 18 to 35 were the most likely to be considering such a move. Data from Harris Poll found that nearly a third of Americans are considering relocating to less crowded places as a direct result of Covid-19. The poll, conducted at the end of April,indicated that respondents aged 18 to 35 were the most likely to be considering such a move.

""Space now means something more than square feet,"" Harris CEO John Gerzema said in a press release. ""Already beset by high rents and clogged streets, the virus is now forcing urbanites to consider social distancing as a lifestyle.""

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also appeared to blame the severity Covid-19 in his city on urban density. ""There is a density level in NYC that is destructive,"" he tweeted . ""It has to stop and it has to stop now. NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density.""

So will there be a long-term push for cities to sprawl outwards in order to reduce downtown populations?

According to Carr, the backlash against city centers may be especially acute in America, where high rates of car ownership make suburban life less inconvenient. ""The United States has always been a country that somewhat fears density,"" she said.

But she, like other experts, worries that a potential retreat from cities will come at a cost. After all, density makes mass transit systems viable, improves access to public facilities (including hospitals) and promotes innovation and creativity.

""I think as designers and urban planners we have to think about how we emphasize the benefits of density,"" Carr added. ""Because now, whenever anyone tries to build new housing anywhere, it's probably going to be the first question that people have.""

Even before the development of germ theory, people have distrusted the benefits of living in close quarters. The Victorians' widespread belief that miasma (or ""bad air"") helped spread disease partly justified the clearance of London's 19th-century slums. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, the perils of density were seemingly laid bare when faulty plumbing saw the deadly virus sweep through Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing estate.

“ Six feet could be the new unit we use when we think about cities and public parks. ” Sara Jensen Carr

sparser cities in Europe and the US. Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has But there is not, yet, any clear evidence linking population density to the spread of Covid-19. Hong Kong (which is more densely populated now than it was in 2003, with some neighborhoods housing more than 60,000 people per square kilometer) has more effectively contained local transmission of Covid-19 thansparsercities in Europe and the US. Robert Steuteville, editor of the journal Public Square, has argued that data from the US (such as the high transmission rates in the relatively sparsely-populated New Orleans, for instance) disprove what he calls the ""'density is dangerous' narrative.""

Whether the use of public transport is a significant factor in Covid-19's spread is a theory still being explored. And while, again, the findings remain far from conclusive, mistrust of buses and subways may nonetheless see their use decline.

Honey-Rosés suggested we may instead see the growth of ""micromobility"" -- vehicles like scooters and e-bikes -- though this could be accompanied by reduced demand for initiatives like bike-sharing schemes.

""The sharing model is going to have additional costs related to hygiene and cleaning, which will be very challenging,"" he said, adding that sharing schemes ""might get hurt in this pandemic.""

Blue-sky thinking

Epidemics can have radical and unexpected effects on architecture and design.

The 1918 flu pandemic, for instance, helped transform home bathrooms , leading property owners to install brass fittings and powder rooms to keep guests from the main lavatories. Later that century, sanatoria built to treat tuberculosis came to inspire the white, clinical aesthetic of modernist architecture (while beliefs the disease could be remedied by sunlight influenced the movement's penchant for terraces and roof gardens, according to Carr).

So although considering the impact of Covid-19 is, at this stage, largely speculative, there's plenty of scope for innovation.

Perhaps we'll see the widespread adoption of automatic doors. Perhaps the popularity of urban farming in recent months will offer new relief from the threat of bare supermarket shelves. Or perhaps the installation of sewage monitors will be used to decipher if -- and where -- certain diseases are growing among city populations.

There have been more outlandish ideas, still. Italian designer Umberto Menasci has envisaged a series of plexiglass boxes that allow beachgoers to relax in isolation. Elsewhere, this year's eVolo skyscraper design competition was won by a prefabricated emergency healthcare tower -- a concept dubbed "" Epidemic Babel "" -- that its Chinese designers claim could be rapidly erected in a future outbreak.

Regardless of such proposals' viability, there is plenty of optimism that this crisis can improve the way cities are designed and run, said Honey-Rosés. But he caveated this by saying politics and opportunism may play significant roles in dictating which ideas come to fruition. (""I'm seeing a lot self-interest in the optimism -- the cyclists are talking about having bigger bike lanes, because that's in their interests,"" he offered as an example.)

But despite his self-professed skepticism, the researcher nonetheless believes that the pandemic has presented real opportunities to rethink public space.

""This is a time for humility on the part of pundits,"" he said. ""And researchers need to be asking good questions. But I also think it's time for city leaders to be bold.

""Things that were not possible before, now are."""
419,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/lgbtq-lavender-symbolism-pride/index.html,How lavender became a symbol of LGBTQ resistance,"Written by Christobel Hastings, CNN

Every year, as summer beckons, Pride month arrives in a burst of color. Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky.

The multicolored flag has united the LGBTQ community for over 40 years, and though it remains a universal symbol of pride, liberation didn't always come in vibrant technicolor.

In fact lavender -- a subtle hue that shifts between light pinkish purples, and gray and blueish tones -- has had, despite its whimsical nature, its own historical significance in representing resistance and power.

The making of a color trend

Like many aspects of queer culture, it's not surprising that lavender's unique color symbolism often skirts under the radar, especially when it comes to mainstream society.

In Western culture it started life as a color of desire, thanks to the lyric genius of 7th century BC poet Sappho, whose papyrus fragments told of her erotic predilections for younger women with ""violet tiaras."" Fast forward a few centuries, and in the 1920s, violets were still drawing together members of the lesbian community, who gifted the delicate flowers as an expression of sapphic interest.

... allowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye."" It wasn't until the 19th century -- with the accidental invention of a purple synthetic dye -- that the color would become popular in fashion. ""Synthetic dyesallowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye.""

Towards the end of the 19th century, however, the public began linking lavender with homosexuality. Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and ""art for art's sake.""

Newspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his ""purple hours"" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray.""

The fight for visibility

The 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a ""dash"" or ""streak"" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln's biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president's early male friendships as containing a ""streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets.""

During the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed ""The Lavender Scare"" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality.

In 1969, the color came to symbolize empowerment. Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a ""gay power"" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before.

It was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a ""Lavender Menace."" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words ""Lavender Menace"" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism.

Lavender, however, can't always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest.

Throughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender ""napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake.""

British filmmaker, artist and author Derek Jarman, meanwhile, nurtured the flower among the ""pharmacopoeia"" of medicinal plants at Prospect Cottage, his fittingly boundary-free oasis in Dungeness, southern England. He also cited violet, mallow (mauve) and lavender among the ""colours of Eden"" missing from God's rainbow in his work ""Chroma: A Book of Colour."" Then, of course, there's Gilbert Baker's rainbow flag, which he lovingly re-worked in 2017 with a lavender stripe to "" represent diversity in the era of Trump.""

Living color

These days, the color is being worn with confidence, nonchalance and something that feels like defiance; a nod, perhaps, to the radical protest spirit of the '70s. ""Most simplistically, fashion tends to be cyclical, so colors that haven't been in the public eye for a while are often picked up and reinterpreted by designers,"" said St Clair. ""The interlude allows the designers to reinvigorate them: they feel fresh all over again.""

The color, St Clair said, has been buoyed by the milestones achieved by the LGBTQ community in recent years, including some country's moves to legalize same-sex marriage, and in the US, gay mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential run and last year's Met Gala theme of ""Camp: Notes on Fashion."" The ""attacks on gay and transgender civil rights by the current administration,"" she added, has also increased the spotlight on the community, encouraging them ""to rally around each other and explore and celebrate identifying symbols that have been important to them in the past.""

Perhaps it's why we're seeing the color's resurgence on the spring-summer 2020 catwalks -- in the form of Loewe's 17th century-inspired lace dresses, Max Mara's soft pastel suiting, Valentino's tiered minidresses, and a dress fashioned entirely from chiffon flowers at Marc Jacobs. Or more explicitly celebrated by editor-at-large of American Vogue Hamish Bowles in his flamboyant Maison Margiela Artisanal ensemble at the 2019 Met Gala.

420,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/india-bollywood-brownface-hnk-intl/index.html,Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?,"Monica Sarkar , CNN Written by

Bollywood may be best known for its glamorous casts, glitzy costumes and energetic dance routines. But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.

""It's actually racism,"" said award-winning film director Neeraj Ghaywan. ""Let's not mince our words.""

In the United States, the concepts of blackface and brownface date back to the 19th century , when white performers would darken their faces with makeup, and use racist stereotypes to portray black and other ethnic minority characters. White performers did this in a time when non-white professionals were themselves barred from employment in the industry.

And the practice dates back even further in England, to the Elizabethan era, when directors traditionally cast white actors to play minority characters in Shakespearean plays. Even into recent decades, the African general in ""Othello"" has long been played by a white actor with darkened skin, including Orson Welles in 1951 and Laurence Olivier in 1965.

It's also appeared in modern films. Dan Aykroyd wore blackface and dreadlocks in 1983's ""Trading Places,"" and Robert Downey Jr. appeared several shades darker in 2008's ""Tropic Thunder,"" to play a white Australian method actor who darkened his skin to play a black man in a Vietnam war film.

Bollywood has adopted brownface in a number of films -- by temporarily darkening the skin of performers, especially when they are portraying characters from disadvantaged backgrounds.

As in the early days of Hollywood, critics of this practice say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry.

For example, the popular 2019 film ""Bala"" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

The woman was played by famed actress Bhumi Pednekar (pictured above), who had her skin darkened in order to play the role. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media.

Some pointed out the irony of one of the film's promotional posters tweeted by Pednekar, where her character was ""surrounded by skin lightening products (and) is actually lightskinned and in brownface.""

Pednekar defended the director's decision to cast her in the movie, according to Indian media reports, saying factors apart from physical appearance play a major role: ""If a filmmaker has taken me, it is because I add some value to the film."" ​

The director, Amar Kaushik, told the Press Trust of India he ""thought about casting a dark-skinned actor,"" but ""felt Bhumi was superb for this character.""

CNN reached out to Pednekar via her agent and Kaushik for comment, but both ​declined to comment.

Credit: Reliance Entertainment/Youtube

The popularity of films that use brownface, such as box office hits ""Super 30"" and ""Gully Boy,"" also released in 2019, suggest that Bollywood ​is yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.

'Glamour behind the mask'

India's attitude towards fairness is an ancient concept.

""It predates colonialism and is certainly linked to caste,"" said sociologist Sanjay Srivastava, who works at the Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi.

""Hindu religious texts are full of what we would now recognize as racial stereotypes: lower caste figures as dark and ugly... To be dark is to be a manual laborer, working in the sun. Fair skin is also a mark of class.""

The arrival of pale-skinned British colonial leaders in the 18th century also had a role to play, deepening the prejudice, he said.

""During the colonial era, race and racism functioned in the context of the so-called mixed-race populations, the Anglo-Indians. The 'closer' you were to a white progenitor, the higher up in the hierarchy of race."" British rule is also blamed for further polarizing the castes.

Fairness, on the other hand, is revered and considered a sign of beauty and status. ""Bollywood, and Indian cinema generally, had two remarkable antecedents: religious iconography and Parsi theater,"" said Vijay Mishra, a Professor of English Literature at Australia's Murdoch University and the author of ""Bollywood cinema: Temples of desire.""

""For both, 'whiteness' was essential,"" Mishra said.

Hindu gods and goddesses are ""remarkably white,"" except for dark-skinned Shiva, Rama and Krishna, he said. In Parsi theater, ""Parsis, through their Iranian ethnicity, are extremely fair.""

India's independence in 1947 paved the way for a new constitution that outlawed caste-based discrimination, but it is still prevalent in parts of India. In its 2019 World Report , Human Rights Watch noted that Dalits, formerly referred to as ""untouchables,"" ""continued to be discriminated against in education and in jobs.""

And colorism, discrimination based on the color of someone's skin, is prevalent in Bollywood, Srivastava argued. ​

""Colorism is not problematized at all, since a vast number of Bollywood cinema relies upon prejudice as a vehicle for entertainment.

""It would be considered perfectly natural that they would don brownface to portray a dark character... (because audiences) also like to be assured that the glamour is still there, behind the mask.""

CNN reached out to Yash Raj Films that handles ""Gully Boy"" actor Ranveer Singh's publicity for comment, but they declined.

""Super 30"" actor Hrithik Roshan's representatives did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The decision to choose a fair-skinned, famous actor over a dark-skinned performer is based on the desire to make a big budget movie ""financially viable,"" said film director ​Neeraj Ghaywan, who has worked on Bollywood and independent films. ""That is how people think in Bollywood.""

As a member of the Scheduled (or Dalit) Caste, the lowest rung on India's societal ladder, Ghaywan is a rare exception in an industry dominated by higher castes.

He tweeted a callout last year for assistant writers and directors from lower castes to contact him for work.

Ghaywan believes Bollywood's lack of diversity may be partly why caste is misrepresented.

People from the Scheduled Caste make up 16.6% of the Indian population, according to 2011 census figures. But in 2014, analysis by The Hindu newspaper found that only two Bollywood movies made that year had featured a lower caste character in a leading role.

However, Ghaywan argued that the root of the problem is that caste discrimination is deeply entrenched in India and that Bollywood is merely reflecting society's ideals.

""They have been so internalized through our cinema itself,"" he said, referring to an early example of the 1957 Indian epic ""Mother India,"" where actor Sunil Dutt's skin was darkened to play the role of a farmer.

""We internalize it so much that it is part of a muscle memory, and we don't even think about it.""

Bollywood's endorsement of fairness products

But ​like discrimination on the basis of caste, discrimination on the basis of skin color is not confined to the big, Bollywood screen.

Seema Hari was born and raised in Mumbai. She said she was bullied at school for being dark-skinned and even taunted on the street by passersby who would tell her that she was bringing bad luck by showing her face in public.

""I did not know a reality where I was not depressed or suicidal in my childhood,"" said Hari who is now a Snapchat software engineer and model based in Los Angeles.

She also campaigns against colorism, which she said is evident not only in Bollywood but on the shelves of Indian pharmacies and supermarkets that stock skin-lightening products.

Advocates say some of the best-known Bollywood stars are perpetuating the preference for lighter skin by lending their names and faces to the industry's advertising campaigns promoting ""fairness"" creams.

""Some of the ads... were so blatantly racist... If you put a Bollywood star in it, it becomes normal; it becomes what people accept,"" said Hari.

Society's preference for lighter skin has led to a booming global business in skin lightening products. The international market for skin whitening cosmetics is predicted to reach more than $6.5 billion by 2025, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts.

While a handful of Indian celebrities have refused to be associated with skin lightening products, some big names have allowed their faces to be used to promote them in India. ​

Often dubbed the ""King of Bollywood,"" actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed ""Fair and Handsome,"" a fairness cream for men, ​for years.

In 2013, a petition calling for an end to the product's discriminatory advertising garnered more than 27,000 signatories. In 2016, Khan reportedly told The Guardian that he would never use the product himself, although it is unclear whether his sponsorship remains active. His agent did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Khan isn't the only celebrity who has modeled ​for skin lightening products. For example, actor John Abraham currently endorses the Garnier Men PowerLight fairness moisturizer. ""John endorses (the) entire Garnier men's skin care and hair range and the communication is skin and hair care,"" his manager, Minnakshi Das ​said.

In 2014, the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) issued guidelines on the promotion of fairness products, stating that they cannot show dark-skinned people as depressed or disadvantaged.

While the independent body said they saw a ""substantial shift"" in discriminatory advertising, Bollywood stars continued to appear in promotions.

In February, the Indian ministry of health and family welfare proposed a draft bill that would ban advert​isements that promote fairness creams, among other items. Law breakers could face a five-year jail term or ​a Rs 50 lakh fine (about $70,000).

""Celebrity endorsements are a huge part of the advertising industry,"" said Shweta Purandare, secretary general of the ASCI.

""It commands about 24% of India's total advertising expenditure... With new regulations... we expect to see celebrities being more cautious."" However, it is not clear from the bill whether celebrities themselves would be punished.

'They just want to be white'

But skin lightening is not limited to over-the-counter creams.

""We have a few patients who aspire to be in Bollywood (and) who are too much into skin lightening treatments,"" said dermatologist Dr. Sujata Chandrappa, who runs a beauty clinic in the southern city of Bangalore.

Clients ask her how certain dark-skinned stars became so fair-skinned. ""This is deep rooted in the Indian psyche, that fairness is the prerequisite factor to enter into the Bollywood industry.""

She told CNN that she tries to talk some people out of the treatments, only offering the skin lightening procedure if a client has skin issues such as melasma, hyperpigmentation, sun damage or age spots. If a client insists on help to make themselves fairer in the absence of any other skin problems, she refuses to carry out the treatment.

""I get this feeling that I'm encouraging racism, which is not acceptable. But they just want to be white."" ​

However, conversations on colorism are starting to change.

Ten years ago, Indian NGO ""Women of Worth"" founded the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign that runs workshops in schools, colleges, workplaces and communities across the country to dismantle prejudiced attitudes towards dark skin.

They also initiated the petition against Shah Rukh Khan's endorsement of the ""Fair and Handsome"" cream.

Nandita Das, actress and spokeswoman of the ""Dark is Beautiful"" movement, said the campaign has encouraged victims of colorism to share their stories, exposing the extent of India's obsession with fairness.

""Suddenly, it was out in the open, something that had been there for so long in our matrimonial ads, cosmetics and products that we see all around,"" Das told CNN. ""We wonder why we haven't talked about it much earlier.""

Das, who also screen-writes and directs, believes ""we have a long way to go"" before this billion-dollar industry casts a dark-skinned performer in a leading role.

She said her skin tone would make her ""perfect"" for a lower caste or class role. But when she plays ""an educated or upper middle-class character, often the director, cinematographer, or makeup person tell you: 'don't worry, we'll lighten your skin.'""

Das believes Bollywood directors have the freedom to cast whom they please, but she advises thinking ""deeper into that prejudice.""

Some experts argue that Bollywood's influence on society is bigger than ever, partly because of social media.

On-screen stars ""used to be legends whom nobody saw"" in real life, said film critic Subhash Jha. ""(But) they've started to become very close to their fans, so the impact is larger."" The biggest Bollywood stars have tens of millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok, the video-sharing social networking service.

Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin. Imagine ""Shah Rukh Khan walking away from a (fairness product) advertisement,"" she said. ""That itself will change so many minds.""

But does the industry's persistent perpetuation of colorism suggest that it is racist?

""Deeply, fundamentally, irrevocably,"" said Srivastava. ""There are no standards of beauty linked to dark skin... There is no vocabulary within Bollywood to discuss race at all because in broader society, no such vocabulary or context has been allowed to develop.""

When it comes to using brownface in movies, ""they don't even think there's a problem,"" said film director Ghaywan. ""That's the biggest problem.""

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here

For centuries, hair dye has been pivotal in helping people portray a certain image -- to either fit in with the beauty standards of the day or to dramatically subvert them.

Women in particular have long tried to conform with the notion that female beauty comes with a glossy mane -- from blonde to black to dusted with gold or flour, depending on the time and place.

""Throughout history, the status of our hair has served as an instant visual cue for value judgment,"" said Caterina Gentili, PhD candidate at the Centre for Appearance Research in England, in a phone interview. ""One of the many ways for society to objectify female bodies, and deem them worthy, or not, of attention.""

In recent decades, Gentili said ""hair color products have become a key tool for women to stay visible, and shield them from one of the biggest stigmas placed on them: aging.""

By 2025, the global hair color market is expected to be worth around $28 billion , up more than 8% on its estimated value of $17.8 billion in 2019, indicating continuing strong demand for hair-altering products.

However, the figures don't show a small, growing trend among women to embrace their natural locks -- grays included -- as a statement against traditional gender expectations.

Now, dying your hair is not solely about covering up imperfections; it's about upending ideals, making a bold statement and reclaiming your natural hue.

From leeches and sulfuric acid to synthetic dyes

In its early iterations, hair coloring was done by both men and women to enhance their looks or hide white strands, according to Victoria Sherrow's ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History.""

Ancient civilizations used rudimentary hair colorants, based on recipes that included cassia bark, leeks, leeches, charred eggs, henna -- still commonly used across the Middle East and India -- and even gold dust.

Ancient Greeks favored gold and red-gold shades, associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, health and youthfulness. Likewise, high-class Greek and Roman prostitutes opted for blonde hues to suggest sensuality.

It wasn't until the Middle Ages in Europe that hair dyeing began shifting into a predominantly female habit.

Bleaches, often made with blended flowers, saffron and calf kidneys, were particularly in vogue, although Roman Catholics associated blond hair with lasciviousness.

Red dyes, often a mix of saffron and sulfur powder -- the latter of which could induce nosebleeds and headaches, was popularized during the 16th-century reign of Elizabeth I of England.

The hue was a favorite in Italian courts as well, thanks to Renaissance artist Titian, who painted female beauties with red-gold locks. In the 18th century, European elites favored perfumed white and pastel powders made from wheat flour dusted lightly onto natural hair and wigs.

While most hair dyes were composed of plants and animal products, the evolution of the practice also saw the use of dangerous, even lethal methods to change hair color: lead combs to darken it, or sulfuric acid to lighten it.

It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.

In 1907, a young French chemist named Eugene Schueller used para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a chemical discovered in the previous century, for the world's first synthetic dye, which he called ""Oréal.""

Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color. In 1909, he decided to change it to something a little snappier: L'Oréal.

The aging card

For the first decades of the 20th century, women were fearful of commercial dye formulants. Chemical hair color was considered unsafe, and the practice itself had an image problem: as in the modest Victorian era, it was seen as something vain women, not respectable housewives, would do.

In the 1940s, even as the beauty trend became more popular, salons offered back entrances for clients who didn't want to make their dye habits known.

To expand their market, some beauty companies decided to tap into the anxiety around aging and sell color as a way to cover up gray hair. A black-and-white French L'Oréal ad from the 1920s depicted a sad-looking woman next to a smiling version of herself in a black bob; the English translation reads: ""Not one more white hair; forever 30 years old.""

A Clairol print campaign from 1943, ""Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator,"" declared: ""Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life... It can dictate many things you say or do. No wonder other women refuse to tolerate this tyrant.""

Pressuring women to maintain their hair color as they aged ""was the marketing ploy that made hair dye as ubiquitous as using soap,"" said Claire Robinson, author of the essay ""Grey is a Feminist Issue.

""While the ideal had been perpetuated for generations, the modern beauty industry pushed it in a more aggressive way, playing on insecurities (and) self-doubt.""

Advertising companies also worked on normalizing dyes by selling them on their subtlety, such as the iconic 1956 Clairol ad ""Does she...or doesn't she?,"" which was so popular that copywriter Shirley Polykoff's slogan became a catchphrase in the States. Around that time, the debut of home-color kits also ensured privacy, paving the way for the widespread use of hair dye.

While in the 1950s only 4-7% of American women dyed their hair, by the 1970s, the figure had risen to some 40%. By 2015, an estimated 70% of American women were using it. A 2019 OnePoll survey for haircare brand Living Proof showed similarly high figures in the UK.

In South and East Asia, the picture is similar. In India, where the hair care industry is a $3.3 billion business, colorants account for 18% of the overall hair category and have been growing 15% a year, according to a report by Nielsen . Indian women are particularly fond of Garnier Black Naturals , owned by L'Oréal, currently its highest selling hair dye brand globally.

Sales of hair colorants in the Middle East and Africa registered at $201.88 million in 2017, an increase of almost 10% over 2016, with bleachers as the market's fastest growing segment.

China and South Korea have all seen a huge increase in demand for hair color products, mostly darker dyes, both for men and women. In Japan, the beauty ideal attached to black hair is so strong that some schools force students to dye their hair black, though in recent years the rule has provoked backlash.

But dyeing is no longer just about natural looks. Dip dyes and rainbow hues spanning pink, turquoise and violet have become fashionable for young women across the world and, to an extent, men (such as celebrities Jared Leto and Zayn Malik). Bright shades also began appearing on armpit hair, notably by Miley Cyrus.

Roxie Jane Hunt, a Seattle-based hair stylist who specializes in rainbow dyes, sees this new approach as a way ""to demonstrate personal choice and play around with identity,"" she said over the phone. ""A lot of women feel like they want to stand out, not blend in.""

In Asia, South Koreans especially embraced rainbow dyes, from coral to ash to cherry pink. Chameleon-like hair changes even became a signature look for a number of K-pop stars -- so much so that a new hair color is often seen as signifier of a change in those artists' careers, be it a new album, single, or tour.

Over the last couple of years, a growing number of Asian women have also been going blond or full platinum -- a way for some to feel like a stronger version of themselves

Gray is the new blond

Gray has also become popular -- entering salons and home kits as a ""hot"" new dye.

Shades of silver, steel or platinum white -- for which social media coined the hashtag #grannyhair -- were touted by celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande.

Suddenly, gray tones were cool -- albeit, one might argue, only on women under 40, and when achieved via costly colorants and treatments.

While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

""Gray has been made out to be something to be avoided at all costs in the name of self-respect,"" Robinson noted.

For the handful of famous women who have embraced it -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Jamie Lee Curtis, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde -- there's a much larger segment of the entertainment, cultural and political worlds that have not.

""The lack of white-haired role models or naturally graying young stylish icons isn't at all surprising,"" Gentili said. ""For a long time, and still today, a woman with gray hair would conjure up images of a grandmother: wise and nurturing, but completely desexualized. Salt-and-pepper men on the other hand -- even that expression is so different! -- are seen as distinguished, charismatic, confident, experienced, sexy.""

For a lot of women, the double standard feels ever-so stifling. Since Truslow Smith launched "" Grombre"" -- a play on gray and ombre -- in 2016, the Instagram account has garnered more than 174,000 followers, with dozens of women submitting photos of their gray heads daily. Truslow Smith, who found her first gray hair at 14 and decided to stop dyeing at 24, said it has encouraged positive conversations around the topic, but also served as a form of validation.

""Embracing natural gray hair truly is a lifestyle shift, not just a trend,"" she said. Most people who do it don't usually return to dyeing. It's a liberating decision.""

She notices how young some of the posters are, and hopes the term ""premature graying,"" which describes people in their 20s and 30s, can be re-evaluated.

""Is it truly 'premature graying,' or has hair dye been established as such a standard that we don't know what natural looks like at certain ages?""

Be it gray or lime green, embracing a color change outside of the established canon is, for many, a leap of faith.

""It's a form of self-expression,"" Hunt said.

All the more if you're asserting yourself as a woman who is not afraid of aging.

""It takes courage,"" Gentili said. ""It's a choice far more rebellious than any pink dye will ever be.""

Type ""When did women start..."" into Google and one of the top autocomplete suggestions to pop up is, ""When did women start shaving?""

The answer goes back centuries. Hair removal -- or otherwise -- has long shaped gender dynamics, served as a signifier of class and defined notions of femininity and the ""ideal body.""

However, in its most recent evolution, body hair is being embraced by a growing number of young women who are turning a source of societal shame and turning it into a sign of personal strength.

The rise of gender fluidity, the body-positivity movement and the beauty sector's growing inclusiveness have all contributed to the new wave of hirsuteness.

""It's been deeply stigmatized -- it still is -- and cast with shame,"" said Heather Widdows, professor of global ethics at the UK's University of Birmingham and author of ""Perfect Me: Beauty as an Ethical Ideal,"" in a phone interview. ""Its removal is one of the few aesthetic traditions that have gone from being a beauty routine to a hygienic one.

""Today, most women feel like they have to shave. Like they have no other option. There's something deeply fraught about that -- though perceptions are slowly changing.""

From ancient Egypt to Darwin

Hairlessness wasn't established as a mandate for women until the early 20th century.

Before that, removing body hair was something both men and women did -- as far back as the Stone Age, then through ancient Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire -- using seashells, beeswax and various other depilatories. In these earlier eras, as Victoria Sherrow writes in ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History,"" hairlessness was seen mostly as a way to keep the body clean. Ancient Romans also associated it with class: The smoother your skin was, the purer and more superior you were.

In the Middle East, as well as East and South Asia, threading was used on the entire face. But unibrows were actually considered alluring for both sexes, and were often accentuated with kohl.

In Persia, hair removal and brow-shaping was a marker of adulthood and marriage for women, and was mainly reserved for that occasion. While in China, body hair was long considered normal, and even today woman face far less social pressure to shave.

The same goes for other countries in Asia: While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent's young women, waxing or trimming pubic hair, for instance, isn't as common as it is in the West.

In fact, in Korea, pubic hair was long considered a sign of fertility and sexual health -- so much so that, in the mid-2010s, it was reported that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair to their own.

Europeans weren't always obsessed with hair-free skin.

In the Middle Ages, good Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow as a display of femininity, while keeping it concealed in public. The face was the only place where hair was considered unsightly: 14th-century ladies would pluck the hair from their foreheads in order to push back their hairlines and give their faces a more oval appearance. When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.

By the late 18th century, hair removal still wasn't considered essential by European and American women, although when the first safety razor for men was invented by French barber Jacques Perret in 1760, some women reportedly used them too.

It wasn't until the late 1800s that women on both sides of the Atlantic started making hair removal an integral part of their beauty routines. The modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin's 1871 book ""Descent of a Man,"" according to Rebecca Herzig's ""Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.""

Darwin's theory of natural selection associated body hair with ""primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier, 'less developed' forms,"" wrote Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Conversely, having less body hair, the English naturalist suggested, was a sign of being more evolved and sexually attractive.

As Darwin's ideas became popularized, other 19th-century medical and scientific experts began linking hairiness to ""sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence,"" Herzig continued. Interestingly, those connotations were applied mostly to women's body hair, not men's -- not just because of evolutionary arguments but also, the author pointed out, the enforcement of ""gendered social control"" on women's rising role in society. Making women think they had to be hairless to be considered worthy of attention was a heteronormative way of controlling their bodies -- and, inherently, their selves -- through shame, Widdows explained.

By the early 1900s, upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as disgusting, with its removal offering ""a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant,"" Herzig wrote.

A female 'necessity'

In the first decades of the 20th century, changing fashions -- sleeveless dresses exposing the skin -- further popularized body hair removal in the US.

In 1915, Harper's Bazaar was the first women's magazine to run a campaign dedicated to the removal of underarm hair (""a necessity,"" as it was described). That same year, men's shaving company Gillette launched the first razor marketed specifically for women, the Milady Décolletée. Its advert read, ""A beautiful addition to Milady's toilet table -- and one that solves an embarrassing personal problem.""

The shorter hemlines of the 1930s and '40s, and a shortage of nylon stockings during World War II meant more and more American women began shaving their legs, too. The introduction of the bikini in the US in 1946 also led shaving companies and female consumers to focus on the trimming and shaping of their nether regions.

In the 1950s, as Playboy hit the newsstands (its first issue came out in 1953), clean-shaven, lingerie-touting women set a new standard of sexiness. By 1964, 98% of American women aged 15 to 44 were regularly shaving their legs. Wax strips and the first laser hair removal also debuted around then, though the latter was quickly abandoned for its damaging effects on the skin before being reintroduced decades later.

""And yet shaving was far from being as extreme as it is today,"" Widdows said. ""In the late 1960s and 1970s, full bushes were not at all uncommon, even in Playboy. Around that time you also had the second wave of feminism and the spread of hippie culture, both of which rejected hairless bodies. For a lot of women, body hair was symbol of their fight for equality. It wasn't seen as unnatural -- not yet.""

That shift, Widdows said, kicked off in the following decades, with the rising popularity of waxing, pornography and increasingly explicit pop culture. In 1987, seven sisters from Brazil (known as the J Sisters) opened a salon in New York City offering the so-called ""Brazilian"" -- a complete wax hair removal of the genital region. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell started doing it. The masses followed suit.

""Removing body hair went from being 'expected' to the norm,"" Widdows explained. ""Being hairless has come to be seen as the only 'natural' and clean way to present the body. Except it really isn't.""

With advertising and media further promoting the ideal of hair-free bodies, the idea that female hair is gross has only grown. In turn, methods to achieve hairlessness have become more precise: The last four decades have seen the ascent of electrolysis, pulsed light and more advanced laser technology.

""Anything associated with the 'abject' -- what we expel from our cultural worlds in order to define ourselves -- arouses disgust, shame and hostility almost by definition,"" Herzig told CNN in an email. ""Visible female body hair certainly tends to be treated as abject today. It's worth noting that those are ideas about cleanliness, contingent social norms, rather than about actually removing 'dirt.' Most hair removal practices tend to introduce new opportunities for abrasion and infection.""

Embracing hairiness

In 2008, Breanne Fahs, professor of women and gender studies at Arizona State University, set female students an assignment to grow their body hair and write a paper reflecting on the experience. Fahs later extended the assignment to include the course's men, who were asked to shave their legs. The project still runs today.

""The assignment has spotlighted the cultural inevitability of female hair removal,"" Fahs said in a phone interview. ""Over the years, those who have taken part in it have shared quite consistent issues: a deep sense of shame, struggle with self-confidence, even social ostracism.

""There have also been cases of heterosexism and homophobia -- this idea that growing your leg hair automatically implies you're queer, or shaving it means you're a gay man. Women often don't realize how much society, family and friends weigh in on what we do with our bodies. And how much of what we think is a choice -- that 'I choose to shave' -- has actually been imparted to and enforced upon us for generations.""

But Fahs also saw feelings of empowerment, rebellion and anger stirring from the project. ""Particularly in the last two years, in the wake of the election and the #MeToo movement -- there's been a deeper awareness of the restrictions surrounding women's bodies, of feminism, gender and sexuality, and a willingness to push back against it all, or at least break out of the comfort zone,"" she said.

It's not just Fahs' students.

A new cohort of young women is embracing body hair, especially on Instagram. The phenomenon has also made it into magazines. In the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, actress Emily Ratajkowski posed with unshaven underarms (a full 360-degree turn for the publication since its early anti-armpit hair messages). YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen and musician Halsey have also showed off their body hair.

Newly launched women's shaving brands are also making a case for female fuzz, and encouraging positive conversations around the topic. The Flamingo razor, from the popular grooming line Harry's, emphasizes the right to choose whether to shave with ad slogans like ""No Waxation Without Representation"" and ""We Are Grow Choice.""

ed diverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness. Direct-to-consumer razor start-up Billie , established in 2017, is another company that's marketing the idea of choice. Rather than showing the perfectly smooth models typical of female shaving ads, its campaigns depictdiverse groups of women shaving, combing their wispy underarm locks or lying on the beach in bikinis with varying levels of hairiness.

""For so long, advertising has only reinforced the taboo around the subject,"" said Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley in a phone interview. ""We wanted to actually acknowledge that women have body hair, show it, and say that shaving is a choice. If you want to keep your body hair, we celebrate that. And if you want to remove it, that's fine as well.""

Photographer Ashley Armitage, who worked on the Billie campaigns and artfully depicts body hair on her Instagram account , agrees. ""Body hair is a personal choice,"" she wrote in an email. ""Shaving it, waxing it, or growing it are all valid options, and all up to the individual.""

The idea that not shaving can be a choice may not seem revolutionary, when it comes to normalizing body hair. But it could be an important step towards reframing the issue.

""I think more women are realizing how body hair is deeply connected to gender and power,"" said Fahs. ""The emotional nature of what body hair elicits in people has tremendous potential as a tool for activism and social change.""

The men may not be wearing much, but the accoutrements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) are unmistakable.

For Ming, born and raised in China but living in Berlin since 2005, the risqué motif of homoerotic PLA soldiers came naturally.

""I paint what interests me -- and from personal experience,"" said the 40-year-old gay artist, who uses ""Musk Ming"" as a pseudonym. He grew up in a military compound in northern China and attended a Chinese naval academy before moving to Germany. ""The soldiers I saw were the ideal men: young, innocent ... and beautiful.""

That's hardly how China's strictly controlled state media described uniformed men in its recent exhaustive coverage of the country's grand military parade, which marked the 70th anniversary of Communist rule.

On October 1, millions of Chinese viewers watched an all-powerful President Xi Jinping approvingly inspect 15,000 PLA troops -- mostly young male soldiers with chiseled faces and fierce looks -- as they goose-stepped through the center of Beijing, followed by columns of tanks, missiles and drones.

Underscoring the soldiers' physical and mental toughness, adulatory news reports detailed every aspect of their selection and training for the grandiose display of Chinese military might.

The vast chasm between Ming's work and the images shown in state media perfectly illustrates a heated debate in China about what constitutes the image of the ""ideal man.""

It's a conversation unfolding as the ruling Communist Party's cultural czars tighten their grip over the country's creative sector by, among much else, regulating the on-air appearances of male celebrities, from movie stars to boyband members.

Depicting masculinity in art

In discussions about masculinity in China's heavily censored cyberspace, a consensus often emerges on the gold standard of an ideal Chinese man: the PLA soldier.

It's a sentiment that experts say has been reflected in art throughout the history of the People's Republic, which was founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong following the Communists' triumph in a bloody civil war.

From vintage propaganda posters to slick new music videos, images of PLA troops have long shaped modern Chinese perceptions of masculinity. The soldiers' strong bodies and minds are touted as the ultimate male virtues, along with their fierce loyalty to the party -- qualities that some say Xi eagerly wants to promote as he vows to lead China into a great ""national rejuvenation.""

For the first three decades of Communist rule, artistic depictions of Chinese men were dominated by heroic portrayals of PLA soldiers and, to a lesser degree, farmers and industrial workers -- two pillars of the proletariat class.

Although some of the genre's works were created with ink, in a traditional Chinese style, the majority comprised neoclassical oil paintings or watercolors by artists who either studied overseas or were influenced by Western trends, according to You Yang, deputy director of the Beijing-based UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.

Neoclassical art, which traces its origin to ancient Greece and Rome though it rose to prominence in 19th-century Europe, is known to feature male protagonists with accentuated muscles striking gallant poses.

After 1949, Mao made it clear that ""all artwork must reflect the leadership of the Party and the will of the state,"" said You, explaining that neoclassicism found fertile ground in Communist societies -- first the Soviet Union and then China -- where artists used the style to fulfill their political duty of worshipping war heroes or strongman leaders.

The oil painting ""Forcibly Crossing the Dadu River"" is one oft-cited example in this category. Illustrating a turning point during the Red Army's famous Long March in the 1930s, the unknown artist depicted 10 young soldiers on a small boat as they charged toward enemy fire.

Their tanned, sinewy arms in various states of motion, half of the soldiers row the vessel against rapid currents and high waves, while their comrades point their guns at the banks -- a moment in time, captured before Communist troops clinched what they have since described as a miraculous victory against a bigger and better-armed enemy.

Such portrayals of male characters and historic victories reached their peak during the decade-long Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966. In paintings, as well as on stage and on screen, all protagonists -- who were almost always men -- had to be ""red and bright"" to highlight their revolutionary credentials and heroism.

The result was an inevitably politicized masculinity, said You, represented by military men with sharp jawlines and muscular arms. Throwing their clenched fists into the air as they vowed to defeat the enemy, these heroes were devoid of any hint of sexuality, in line with the party's puritanical moral code.

Mao's death in 1976 spelled the end of the Cultural Revolution, but the now-entrenched public perception of masculinity persisted despite growing diversity in artistic depictions of men -- a trend that began with the display of male subjects in more vulnerable emotional states, ranging from angst to melancholy.

'Little fresh meat'

In a country now boasting more than 800 million internet users, the ideal aesthetics of the PLA soldier are being challenged by a new generation that increasingly looks to young celebrities -- and their social media presence -- for cues on what it means to be a man.

This includes some of the country's most bankable young entertainers, including singer-actor Lu Han, who appeared alongside Matt Damon in the 2016 action film ""The Great Wall"" and has more than 60 million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo, and boyband TFBoys, three teenage heartthrobs estimated by local media to be multi-millionaires.

Dubbed ""little fresh meat"" by domestic media for their boyish features and popularity, many of today's young male celebrities put on makeup, dye their hair bright colors, accessorize and sport androgynous clothing. Like South Korean K-pop stars, they boast slender figures and often wear cutesy expressions.

In a report released early this year, the online shopping platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba found sales of men's cosmetic products jumped more than 50% in 2018, naming the popularity of ""pretty boys"" as a reason.

But after a period of social liberalization in the post-Mao era, there are signs that Xi's government is beginning to turn against male role models deemed too effeminate. A widely cited commentary , published last year by state-run Xinhua news agency, said: ""Whether a country embraces or rejects (effeminate men) is ... a grave matter that affects the nation's future.""

Focusing its ire on wildly popular male idols, the article blasted the ""sickly aesthetics"" that had propelled ""gender-ambiguous, heavily made-up, tall and delicate"" young men to stardom on television and online.

""The phenomenon of 'sissy men' has caused a public backlash because the impact of such sickly culture on the youth cannot be underestimated,"" it said.

""When critics say 'sissy young men turn a nation sissy,' they may sound somewhat facetious,"" it added. ""(But) nurturing a new generation that could rejuvenate the nation requires the resistance of erosive unhealthy culture.""

Following Xinhua's lead, other Chinese media outlets have published blistering editorials and commentaries criticizing male celebrities who appear effeminate.

There have also been user-generated online campaigns calling for some celebrities to be banished from the country's airwaves and internet platforms because of how they look. The government also seems to be tightening restrictions on what is seen on screen.

Earlier this year, China's major video-streaming platforms began censoring male actors' earrings, blurring their earlobes. Incidentally, the ban came after censors prohibited the depiction of same-sex relationships on television and online, along with a wide range of what China calls ""vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content"" that also includes incest and one-night stands.

Some targeted celebrities, including TFBoys, have responded to critics by ditching cosmetics and flowery wardrobes in favor of showing toned muscles in photo shoots.

Another trend has been the launch of a growing number of so-called ""masculinity programs"" aimed at instilling traditional gender roles in boys and young men through outdoor sports and classroom training. Last year, one such club in Beijing attracted attention -- and some criticism -- for having its students run shirtless in the dead of winter. ""There is a crisis in boys' education and I threw myself into practical actions to save them and help them find their lost masculinity,"" the Boys' Club founder told the South China Morning Post.

""'Sissy men' are under attack because they are perceived to be challenging the traditional notion of manliness,"" said Fang Gang, an associate professor at Beijing Forestry University whose research focuses on gender studies and sex education.

Fang points out that, ironically, the current controversy is partly due to recent progress made by sexual minorities in China. Activists say a nascent but increasingly visible LGBTQ rights movement is slowly changing hearts and minds, encouraging greater social acceptance.

""Some parents extend their worries about perceived gender-neutral appearances by linking it to homosexuality,"" he said. ""Greater social acceptance of the gay community has only deepened fears among homophobic people, making them more anxious and afraid of non-mainstream masculinity.""

Others suspect a more direct link between the crackdown on ""sissy men"" and top officials' worldviews, which for many were shaped during the Cultural Revolution.

The strongman

President Xi's attitude towards masculinity may trace back to his youth, which, from the late 1960s to mid-1970s, was spent in the Chinese countryside along with as many as 17 million other high school students and graduates. They were part of the ""sent-down"" generation relocated to the country's far-flung corners to learn agricultural and political lessons from poverty-stricken peasants.

""In the summer, I was almost sleeping in a pile of fleas -- all the bites and subsequent scratching turned my whole body swollen,"" he wrote in 2002. ""But after two years, I became used to it and could sleep through the night no matter how much I got bitten.""

The Chinese leader's definition of manliness also has a political dimension. During a meeting with officials in southern China just months after taking power, Xi reportedly lamented the lack of strong convictions among Soviet communists when their party was on the verge of collapse. He was widely quoted by overseas Chinese-language media as saying that: ""In the end nobody was a real man, nobody came out to resist.""

Xi's government seems determined to resist the perceived feminization of Chinese men through regulations and propaganda.

In a sign of a tightened political environment, artist Ming was reluctant to acknowledge the sensitivity of his art, which includes an almost-naked portrayal of the iconic PLA soldier from the Cultural Revolution-era opera ""Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.""

""Strength is needed -- with muscles -- for militaries, revolutions and the proletariat, which means manual labor,"" said Ming. ""But in traditional Chinese art and literature, male beauty is about being delicate, pale and pretty,"" he added, pointing to a contradiction in the way men have been depicted through history.

""I paint from a Chinese perspective -- and my work is on a continuum of Chinese aesthetics,"" he said.

For now, Ming's website remains blocked in China and the artist doesn't foresee his work being exhibited in his home country anytime soon. The cultural tradition that inspired him appears increasingly incompatible with the muscular strength appreciated and projected by the Chinese leader at home and abroad.

Last year, China's largely ceremonial parliament endorsed a constitutional amendment scrapping presidential term limits and paved the way for Xi, 66, to stay in power indefinitely. Nevertheless, Ming anticipates an eventual change of guard in leadership -- and the impact it could have on cultural attitudes.

""The older generation finds it harder to accept new things ... it applies to not just 'sissy men' but many other things,"" he said. ""I think we need time."""

But at the dawn of a new decade, it seems fitting to look ahead at the structures set to shape our cities -- and architecture itself -- in the coming year.

From museums and skyscrapers, to a hotel with a hole in it, these are CNN Style's most anticipated buildings opening or completing in 2020.

Vancouver House, Vancouver, Canada

BIG / Luxigon

Twisting from a triangular base to a rectangular top, Vancouver House appears to defy the laws of engineering when viewed from afar.

It's precisely the sort of eccentricity we've come to expect from Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect who recently built a ski slope on top of a power plant in Copenhagen. But it's also a smart response to various restrictions and regulations that limited the size of the tower's footprint in downtown Vancouver.

The pixelated facade, also characteristic of Ingels' work, helps to create deep-set balconies for residents in the 493-foot-tall tower.

Nanjing Zendai Himalayas Center, Nanjing, China

MAD Architects

Taking inspiration from traditional Chinese ""shanshui"" paintings (literally ""mountain and water""), Ma Yansong's curved creations merge nature with the built environment. This new 23-acre development in the historic city of Nanjing is surely the most ambitious realization of the architect's ""shanshui city"" concept to date.

Irregular white fins give the complex's towers the appearance of icy mountains, their flowing lines contributing to what Beijing-born Ma's firm, MAD, describes as a ""philosophy of cooperation between humanity and nature."" At ground level, six separate plots are connected via man-made streams and footbridges.

With the country's authorities pushing for increasingly conservative architecture , the complex is a refreshing reminder of what bold Chinese architecture can look like.

Powerhouse Telemark, Porsgrunn, Norway

Bloomimages / Snøhetta

Snøhetta made international headlines last year when its underwater restaurant -- Europe's first -- opened near the southernmost tip of Norway. But the design firm has also gained a reputation for innovative carbon-negative buildings that, over their lifetimes, produce more energy than they consume.

Located on the banks of the Porsgrunn River, the practice's latest ""energy-positive"" project, Powerhouse Telemark, has been designed to ""set a new standard for the construction of the buildings of tomorrow.""

Everything about the sleek structure, which is almost entirely coated in photovoltaic cells, has its carbon footprint in mind, from a diamond shape that maximizes the solar energy it captures, to the use of recycled materials from local demolition projects.

New Museum of Western Australia, Perth, Australia

In designing a museum on a site littered with historic buildings, architecture firms Hassell and OMA faced a delicate task: building a 21st-century museum while preserving the surrounding heritage.

The result is a striking contemporary creation that complements, interacts with and wraps around existing structures -- some of which date back to the mid-19th century -- producing an unlikely synergy of brick, glass and steel.

Perhaps the most striking feature is how the museum's huge upper volume hangs dramatically over Hackett Hall, the State Library's old reading room.

Grand Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt

Such have been the delays facing the Grand Egyptian Museum that it featured on this very list two years ago -- and the $1-billion project is still yet to open.

Having said that, 2020 looks sure to be the year it finally does. As well as offering a permanent home to tens of thousands of archeological treasures, including the entire contents of Tutankhamun's tomb, the 5.2-million-square-foot museum symbolizes efforts to repair the country's tourism industry in the wake of the 2011 revolution.

The building's glass-fronted design, first unveiled over 15 years ago, will offer sweeping panoramas of the Great Pyramids and Giza plateau.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport, Berlin, Germany

Berlin's new Brandenburg airport is, perhaps, less anticipated for its design than for the fact it's almost a decade late.

Following years of setbacks, the German capital's new transport hub is finally due to open its doors in 2020. And while it wouldn't be the project's first missed deadline (officials initially expected it to open in October 2011), there seems to be an air of certainty about the recent announcement that the airport would enter operation in October.

The terminal building, which sits between two parallel runways, was designed to represent the region's architectural heritage. Official press materials cite the influence of 19th-century Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the celebrated Bauhaus art school.

Opus, Dubai, UAE

Laurian Ghinitoiu / Zaha Hadid Architects

More than three years after her death, Zaha Hadid continues to shape the world's cities with her bold, curvilinear creations.

Opus, which was first proposed by the British-Iraqi architect in 2007, takes the form of a glass-fronted cube punctured with an asymmetric hole that appears to bulge at the seams. Yet, closer inspection reveals that the building is formed from two separate towers joined by a four-story atrium at its base and a footbridge connecting the upper floors.

The structure will house a boutique hotel -- with interiors also designed by Hadid -- as well as office space and restaurants. Despite being located just a kilometer from the 2,717-feet-tall Burj Khalifa, it might yet be the neighborhood's most eye-catching piece of architecture.

1000 Trees, Shanghai, China

British designer Thomas Heatherwick has never been short of ambition. And now his seemingly farfetched vision of a tree-covered urban mountain has become a reality.

The 3.2-million-square foot development now occupies a huge stretch of riverside in Shanghai. Structural columns emerge from the structure's mass to hold some of the plants and greenery alluded to in the project's name, 1000 Trees.

More than a piece of architecture, this is, in Heatherwick Studio's own words, ""a piece of topography.""

Set across a huge swathe of reclaimed land in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour, the West Kowloon Cultural District has been more than 20 years in the making. And of the many theaters and cultural institutions set to eventually open in the development, none are more hotly anticipated than M+.

The museum is expected to have one of the Asian continent's most impressive collections of contemporary visual art. Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron has built a visually arresting design to boot -- a horizontal slab (containing exhibitions spaces) and a vertical one (housing everything else) conjoined into an upside-down ""T.""

Although the building is set to complete within the next few months, it will be another nine to 12 months before it is opened to the public. Nonetheless, the completion of M+ is a major milestone for the long-awaited cultural quarter.

Singapore Pavilion at the Dubai Expo 2020, Dubai, UAE

Singapore Pavilion, Expo 2020 Dubai

From October, Expo 2020 will see hundreds of participating countries construct pavilions in and around Dubai. There will be plenty of impressive architecture on display, from Canada's circular wooden theater to Austria's ensemble of huge interlocking cones

But perhaps the most ambitious idea is that of Singapore: to create an oasis in the Arabian desert.

The city-state's pavilion will bring dense greenery to the UAE, with canopies leading visitors through a lush hanging garden of trees, shrubs and orchids. And the architecture firm behind the project, WOHA, thinks it can make the project energy neutral over the course of the expo.

Innovations to that end include solar-powered desalination systems for irrigation and a cantilevered roof to provide shade."

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

Hurricane Kimchi takes the stage at an underground bar in Seoul, dancing agilely to Wonder Girls' 2008 K-pop hit ""Nobody.""

Dressed in high heels, a fluffy white wig and a tight gold sequin dress -- an homage to the song's video -- he commands a fervent crowd that cheers, sings along and throws money at his feet. At one point, an audience member runs up to shove a 10,000-won bill (around $9) inside his belt.

Drag queens remain a rare sight in South Korea. But Hurricane Kimchi's alter-ego, LGBTQ activist Heezy Yang, is out to change perceptions in a country with traditionally conservative views on gender and sexuality.

novel about his experience of coming out, to taking part in a mock gay wedding ceremony in Seoul's metro. He is also the founder of the The activist's work ranges from writing anovel about his experience of coming out, to taking part in a mock gay wedding ceremony in Seoul's metro. He is also the founder of the Seoul Drag Parade , an annual event that hopes to ""encourage both queer and non-queer people to use drag to find their identity (and) express their true feelings, thoughts and style,"" according to its website.

Then there are the weekday drag shows he organizes in Itaewon, a diverse international neighborhood that has become the capital's main gay district and is known as ""homo hill"" to the LGBTQ community and locals.

With US troops setting up in Itaewon after the Korean War, the neighborhood gained a reputation for prostitution and nightlife. Trans and drag performers began appearing in clubs for soldiers' entertainment, and the area soon became a refuge for different kinds of marginalized people, according to Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of California, San Diego.

""It is an incredibly diverse (environment, and) the drag scene is definitely something that has been there for a long time, since the 1970s,"" he said in a phone interview. ""And these days, some of the most visible and creative artists and activists come from ... the drag queen community.""

These days, some of the most visible and creative artists and activists come from ... the drag queen community. Todd Henry, a professor of modern Korean history at the University of San Diego

Drag may still be a fringe subculture in South Korea, but the scene appears to be growing. The first Seoul Drag Parade, held last year, attracted over 1,000 participants, far surpassing the initial estimate of 100 people, according to the parade's co-organizer Ali Zahoor. Participation in pride events is also expanding, said Eun-oh Yang of the Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center.

over ""Compared to the past, drag culture exists in more diverse forms for both men and women, and now we have drag queens performing on stage at (the annual) Queer Culture Festival,"" she said, referring to Korea's largest LGBTQ festival, which attractedover 150,000 participants in 2019. ""I think it's being established as (part of) popular culture.""

Drag as a release

Like drag queens around the world, Hurricane Kimchi uses performance to express himself and to break ""the stereotypes and get rid of toxic masculinity,"" he said.

Co-organizer of the Seoul Drag Parade, Ali Zahoor, said there are also uniquely Korean reasons for the growth of Seoul's drag scene -- including the ""anxiety"" caused by the threat of war.

""North Korea's right there ... We are not scared, or we're not thinking about it too much, but it is in the back (of our minds),"" he said. ""Everyone's a little bit anxious all the time (and) I think that's where subcultures emerge.""

""Korean society, as you can imagine, is crazy stressful,"" Zahoor added. ""Working hours are so long, kids have to study until really late at night and there's a need for an escape. (Drag) is a way of getting away from what you usually do, having fun and showing off what you are good at.""

Gender-fluid drag queen and YouTuber, Serena 303 , uses K-pop and '70s fashion models as inspiration for her looks, which includes a transparent plastic dress paired with a pink visor. Her videos, in which she offers makeup tutorials and shares what it's like to be in drag, are designed to empower those still figuring out their identities.

""I want to tell them that it's OK to be who you are, and show them that someone like me can do drag,"" she said. ""The most important thing is that people are going to love you.""

For Seoul-based ""drag king"" and English teacher, Jaxter the Taco Master, drag is both an anti-depressant and a play on gender. She is virtually unrecognizable on stage, with smoky eyes and her face entirely covered in gold glitter.

""Gender is a social construct (and) I can be both masculine and feminine whenever I want,"" she said.

""It's not just what other people want me to be.""

'Don't ask, don't tell'

There remains a pervasive ""don't ask, don't tell"" attitude towards gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ communities in South Korea. Hurricane Kimchi, who uses public transport to travel to his weekly show, said that no one dares look at him during the 30-minute journey.

""People might think and judge, but they wouldn't say anything out loud,"" he said. ""Even when I walk around with my drag makeup, people don't even look at you, they don't really do or say anything.""

While he now feels comfortable putting on makeup at home, it took his mother ""years"" to accept his new identity.

""I think she gradually realized that it's not 'my good little boy, a straight-A student' anymore,"" he said.

In 2014, South Korea's Conservative social attitudes remain prevalent throughout South Korea, which does not legally recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions. Homosexuality remains illegal in the military where it is punishable by up to two years in prison.In 2014, South Korea's National Institute of Korean language reverted its 2012 decision to make the word 'love' gender-neutral after complaints from religious groups. It now defines love as a feeling of affection ""between man and woman.""

Whether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult. Eun-oh Yang, Korean Sexual Minority Culture and Rights Center

""(The) LGBT population will be labeled as going against the Bible (or) going against Confucian tradition and parental values,"" said Henry, the history professor. ""There are even arguments made that gay and lesbian (people) are pro-North Koreans, that they are kind of traitors to their nation.""

Serena 303 said she faced protests from conservative Christians during the Seoul pride parade last year. ""They would say 'You're gay, you're going to die,' and 'Think of your parents,'"" she recalled.

2017 poll by the Korean Society of Law and Policy on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) found that 92.6% of LGBTQ Koreans surveyed were afraid of becoming targets of hate crimes, and 49.3% had experienced ""psychological trauma,"" such as stress and depression, after encountering ""expressions of disgust.""

""Whether you are gay, lesbian or transgender, living as a sexual minority in Korea is very difficult,"" said Yang.

Slow shift toward acceptance

The influence of pop culture may be helping the drag community gain greater acceptance. Hurricane Kimchi said the arrival of Netflix in South Korea in 2016, which brought shows like ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" exposed many people to drag culture for the first time.

The internet is also taking drag culture out of the clubs and into the bedrooms of young South Koreans.

""Before the internet, the drag world would have been confined to the physical space of the club,"" Henry said. ""Now with the internet and Youtube, you can kind of fashion yourself and your style and persona, and you can communicate with other people virtually. That's a really interesting phenomenon.""

And it's having a wider impact on South Korea's LGBTQ community. Parades, events and shows all help to bring drag to a broader audience, Hurricane Kimchi said.

On stage, he may convey the audacious glamour common to leading stars of the drag world.

But for Kimchi, drag is not just about performing -- it's about breaking down barriers and encouraging other people to embrace their true identities.

""I'm not going to be the prettiest beauty queen or the best performer, or the highest paid drag performer,"" he said. ""Those are not my goals.""

""I want to combine drag with activism and art and provide people safe space where they can perform drag and try out drag."""
426,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/menswear-uniforms-fashion/index.html,Menswear has never been so casual. So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring?,"Written by Paul Flynn, CNN

From Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun"" to Richard Gere in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" Hollywood has long-popularized the image of a man in regimented attire. And while menswear has never been more casual, references to the uniform are still present in contemporary collections today. So just what is it about a man in uniform?

From military, to work and sports, uniforms command attention, and the big screen has created a romanticized version of the men behind uniforms.

""Is it an authority thing?"" asked Luke Day, editor of GQ Style. ""Is it a dominance thing? I think ultimately there's a romantic ideal to uniforms because most men in uniforms are heroes.""

Many of the staple items usually found in a stereotypical man's wardrobe -- be it deck shoes, the MA1 bomber jacket, chinos, khakis, epaulettes, a parka or field coat -- are directly descendant of uniforms.

""All menswear is uniform,"" said Julian Ganio, menswear consultant for Fendi. ""It's so tribal, something that's planted in (a man's) brain.""

Standardized dressing has been created to bind people together, but also to set them apart from other groups. ""Men like to be part of a gang,"" said Ganio. ""We want to be with like-minded men. And we want to belong.""

Recently, British professor of fashion design Andrew Groves curated an exhibition titled ""Invisible Men,"" from the menswear archive for the University of Westminster. According to Groves, communication between men is dictated by ""unspoken (style) judgments,"" but the historic narrative behind how men came to dress the way they do remains unexplored territory.

The 170-piece show, which draws an alignment between uniform and fashion, is in part a showcase of the larger Westminster archive, as well as a smart retort to the dearth of menswear exhibits on the art and fashion calendar. ""At the recent Dior show [at the V&A museum],"" said Groves, ""there was no menswear. Nothing. The same at the McQueen.""

Groves took a prosaic approach when curating ""Invisible Men,"" by drawing on the seemingly invisible fashion of British men -- largely missing from museums -- and its roots in uniforms. For this exhibition, he chose to celebrate the style that begins on football terraces and in local pubs, the elements of which are passed down, from father to son, and then twisted to each new generation's tastes.

Groves himself is a Man City season ticket holder and he already knows of several Arsenal fan clubs who have booked tickets for ""Invisible Men,"" on account of its exhaustive archive of Stone Island and CP Company workwear. ""Men have a structure, which goes by unnoticed,"" said Groves, ""But other men notice it. It is a secret code.""

At the Spring-Summer 2020 Maison Margiela show, John Galliano caused a disruptive fashion moment by sending a model,who appeared on the verge of exploding with internal rage, dressed in a sailor-inspired jacket stomping down the runway, perhaps a nod to Brad Davis's mesmerizing role in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Querelle,"" a film about a young sailor.

""If you look at all the British design greats,"" said Day, ""they have regimented uniform detailing in so much of their work. McQueen was full of them.""

Just recently, British menswear's critically acclaimed designer Craig Green created the concierge's uniform for Andre Balacz's newly opened Standard Hotel in London.

Day attributes much of the interest in uniforms to iconic movie imagery men usually become familiar with while they're still young.

As part of his work, Day styles Take That and their former bandmate Robbie Williams. ""There hasn't been a mood board for a single Take That tour that hasn't included a picture of Terence Stamp in 'Far From The Madding Crowd,'"" he said. ""The proportions are so sexual. The broad shoulder and high narrow waist. The way [Stamp]'s military trousers are cut you get a long, lean thigh.""

The image of a man in uniform has often carried a certain sexual undercurrent. ""Think of the Fireman's Ball [episode] in 'Sex and the City,' or Channing Tatum in 'Magic Mike.'"" said Day. ""Uniforms are routinely fetishized. Every basic hen-night stripper has two fails safe costume changes: 'Here's the fireman. Here's the policeman,'"" he added.

Even Andrew Scott's clerical-collared ""Hot Priest"" character, in the award-winning British TV show ""Fleabag,"" recently provoked an international outpouring of love. As it happens, one of the items on display at ""Invisible Men"" is a clerical garment.

""What's lovely about a uniform is that you can be anonymous,"" said Groves, ""and yet it gives you a set of rules that you can break, which is so much a part of the British menswear story. A uniform allows you to do something naughty that you shouldn't do."""
427,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/brazil-fashion-diversity/index.html,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"Written by Jorge Grimberg, CNN

In February, the Brazilian fashion industry made global headlines. Donata Meirelles , then fashion director at Vogue Brazil, was celebrating her 50th birthday in the predominantly black city of Salvador, Bahia. During the celebration, journalist Fabio Bernardo snapped a photo of Meirelles, who is white, sitting in a traditional throne-like chair flanked by two baianas (Afro-Brazilian women wearing white lace gowns and headpieces), which he then shared on Instagram.

To many who saw the post (which has since been deleted), the scene evoked colonial Brazil, when white elites ruled over black slaves.

""What happened there is what happens in this country built on racism, bodies, sweat, blood and black tears,"" Afro-Brazilian actress and activist Tais Araujo, Vogue Brazil's November 2018 cover star, posted to her Instagram account in the days following the event. ""This suffering is so naturalized that it is difficult for people who do not identify with the girls standing by the chair to feel what the black population feels. Everything becomes natural.""

While the party was not an official Vogue event, the backlash was enough to warrant Meirelles' resignation from the title just a few days after the event, and a public apology from the magazine, who wrote on Instagram that they hoped the discussions sparked by the incident had ""served as a learning opportunity."" (Both Meirelles and Vogue Brazil declined to be interviewed for this story.)

And it has: On social media and beyond, the industry and the public have been having long overdue conversations about race and representation in Brazil's fashion community.

According to a Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics study released in 2016, 54% of Brazilians identify as black or multiracial. And yet black people have been all but erased from the mainstream fashion industry -- in front of the camera, on the catwalk and behind the scenes.

Historically, model diversity at São Paulo Fashion Week has been so low that in 2009, following intense pressure from anti-racism activists and state prosecutors, the organizing body mandated that 10% of models in each show must be black.

At last edition of São Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW), which took place in April month, black models were still in the minority, and for the last three seasons, only one black designer -- Luiz Claudio of Apartamento 03 -- has participated. (SPFW CEO Paulo Borges told CNN that organizers are aware of the disparity and are discussing ways to bring in new players.)

Why model Leomie Anderson is fighting for change

""In a country where most of the population is black, it's troubling to think that fashion, one of the most important vehicles of cultural and social expression, excludes such large numbers of creators and consumers,"" Afro-Brazilian artist and fashion designer Carol Barreto, who teaches gender studies at the Federal University of Bahia, said in an email.

""The entertainment world is highly susceptible to reproducing stereotypes, so it's important to study the limits and latitudes imposed when dealing with questions of race,"" she continued, because the propagation of negative images can contribute to perceptions of Black people as inferior.

Juliano Corbetta, founder and editor-in-chief of the online menswear publication Made in Brazil, has witnessed how racial inequality in Brazil can affect a magazine financially.

In early 2018, Corbetta set out to publish an issue that was would feature predominantly black talent (including producers, photographers and models) to inspire ""16-year-old kids dreaming of breaking into a fashion career."" Though he had no trouble finding talent to fill the pages, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to secure the advertisements needed to fund the issue.

""Reality hit. For the first time in nine years in publishing, everyone declined. No one wanted to include this (magazine) in their 2019 plans,"" Corbetta said. Many brands, he claims, told him an all-black issue wouldn't resonate with their audience.

He connects the issue to the fact that, in Brazil, discussing race and racism is still widely taboo. ""We never talk about apartheid. We didn't have a Martin Luther King. We didn't have a Rosa Parks. We didn't have an actual militant anti-racism movement. We have never talked about prejudice, even though it exists, so brands don't talk about it either.""

In this landscape, Brazil's black creatives -- like many marginalized groups around the world -- are increasingly turning to the internet and social media to create spaces for themselves in response to a lack of mainstream opportunity.

This was the route taken by Luiza Brasil, a Rio de Janeiro-based influencer and columnist for the Brazilian edition of Glamour. In 2015, she created Mequetrefismos, an online fashion, beauty and lifestyle publication, to promote the work of black people working within those fields; and, as a curator for the Casa Ipanema lifestyle boutique in Rio, has brought brands runs by black women to the forefront.

""We see more black people featured on magazine covers and in advertisements for luxury stores, but who are the people behind these campaigns? (The fact that they are usually white) says a lot about the lack of black people in organizations and leadership roles,"" Brasil said in a WhatsApp message. ""The black population is in the majority -- at 54% -- but our narratives have always been constructed by white people.""

""I think the Afro-Brazilian (empowerment) movement has always existed, but it's always been invisible. With the help of the internet, the Afro-Brazilian movement has gained momentum.""

Kevin David, a 25-year-old based in São Paulo, agrees. As executive creative director of MOOC , a Black-run creative collective, he's used the power of social media to land youth-oriented collaborative campaigns with the likes of Levi's, Converse, GQ Brazil and Schutz.

""There are fewer opportunities (for black creatives), but we are taking over. We have entered the market ... Weren't happy with the way the market was treating us,"" David said. ""We didn't want anyone else to tell our story. We wanted to take action and show that we believe representation means at this moment in Brazil.""

Brasil believes that the ongoing empowerment black creatives in the digital sphere will help challenge existing narratives and give Brazil more complex, diverse representations of black identity -- within Afro-Brazilian communities and in the mainstream.

""We no longer only represent an image of the ghetto, of blacks speaking only to blacks, but an important snapshot of society and our media in general"", she said.

On June 14, 2018, two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600 Guard vehicles were shipped from the Dutch Port of Rotterdam, heading out on a journey that would take months and see the cars transported thousands of miles through six countries, according to a new report from the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS).

After stops in China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the two cars -- each worth about $500,000 -- are believed to have been flown to their final destination, Pyongyang. And in the North Korean capital, there's only one customer who likely requires this type of ride.

The origin and journey of the two Mercedes luxury vehicles were exposed in the C4ADS report. CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Sanctions passed by the United Nations as punishment for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development are supposed to bar companies and individuals from selling luxury goods to North Korea.

C4ADS found that North Korea imported at least $191 million worth of luxury goods from 2015 to 2017, sourced from ""as many as 90 countries"" in violation of United Nations sanctions. Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn't a shared definition of what constitutes a ""luxury item"" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.

The Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It's equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.

Kim is usually seen being chauffeured in what's believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It's believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.

Kim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year

Daimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it ""has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.""

""Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes. To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process, which we consider appropriate and effective and which meets all requirements of the export control authorities,"" the company said in a statement to CNN.

""Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility. We always investigate the vehicles displayed on the photos in the media thoroughly. However, without the vehicle identification numbers it is impossible to find a concrete trace.""

C4ADS concluded that North Korea maintains a complex, constantly evolving series of schemes in order to obtain luxury goods, like Kim's cars, to get around global export controls. The report concluded Pyongyang has imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017, with the majority originating from Russian companies.

""Not only are they continuing to use techniques that have been successful in disrupting traditional enforcement, but they're also sort of watching how we're tracking them and developing much more sophisticated techniques to continue to evade sanctions,"" said Jason Arterburn, a co-author of the C4ADS paper.

Lucas Kuo, another one of the report's co-authors, told CNN C4ADS' investigation aimed to ""evaluate what were the deficiencies within the international system that allowed this activity to continue?""

Eight months of investigating

Kuo said it took himself and the report's co-authors eight months of investigating how Kim was able allegedly to obtain the Benzes. They scoured customs records, shipping data, bills of lading and other open-source documents to trace how the vehicles made their way from Rotterdam to Pyongyang.

""We think we built a pretty compelling case to say that these Mercedes were likely bound for North Korea,"" he said.

CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Kuo and his co-authors concluded that the two Mercedes left Rotterdam for Dalian, then made their way on to Osaka, Japan, and Busan, South Korea. From South Korea, they were shipped out on a vessel called the DN5505, per the bill of lading.

That's when the journey gets murky. Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.

However, the ship's AIS data stopped pinging locations from October 1 to 19, according to the report. Though AIS transponders do not ping when ships are far at sea, they could have been turned off -- a common tactic used by ships breaking sanctions law, experts say.

When the DN5505's transponder turned back on, the ship was spotted near where it originally disappeared, according to C4ADS, but this time heading in the opposite direction back to Busan. On November 2, the vessel submitted a bill of lading to South Korean customs authorities that showed the ship was transporting anthracite coal allegedly from Nakhodka. But in Nakhodka, ""no record exists"" of the DN5505's arrival, C4ADS said.

CNN has reached out to the Port of Nakhodka authorities for comment on the report.

Back in Russia, on October 7 -- two days after the estimated arrival time of the DN5505 -- three Ilyushin-76 cargo jets operated by North Korea's state-run airline reportedly traveled from Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Those jets are often used to transport armored vehicles used by North Korea's elites, and are rarely spotted in in Vladivostok, C4ADS said.

""When asked for comment, the North Korean consulate in Vladivostok reportedly did not provide an explanation for the unscheduled flights on October 7,"" C4ADS said in its report.

""We have not uncovered direct evidence that the overlapping visits of the cargo jets and the DN5505 to the Russian Far East are related. However, given the heavy lift cargo capacity of the planes and their role in transporting Kim Jong Un's armored limousines, it is possible that the cargo jets could have loaded the Mercedes,"" the C4ADS report said.

Dual use

While cracking down on luxury goods may not hurt North Korea as much as going after its valuable coal exports, identifying those who allegedly helped Kim get his cars could close off some loopholes, said George Lopez, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which is charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement and efficacy.

C4ADS also claims that understanding how North Korea smuggles luxury goods could provide useful information to law enforcement attempting to stop Pyongyang's from obtaining more dangerous items with military or nuclear applications.

""North Korea acquires high-end luxury goods through the same overseas smuggling networks as other contraband. As a result, their detection and seizure could be a means to drive action against the Kim regime's core procurement operations,"" the report found.

""High-end luxury goods share key features with dual-use goods for North Korea's weapons program: they are scarce, specialized products with high monetary value and great symbolic importance for the Kim regime.""

429,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/ryugyong-hotel-architecture-origins/index.html,Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom',"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

In 1987, ground was broken on a grand new hotel in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.

The Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning ""capital of willows"" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.

While the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname ""Hotel of Doom.""

The hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.

Still closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world's tallest unoccupied building.

A Cold War pawn

The Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world's tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South's capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.

As part of North Korea's political response to the South's achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.

But due to engineering problems it wasn't finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang's airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state's frail economy, while the Soviet Union's collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.

North Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.

A concrete structure

The building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.

The pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it's because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.

""It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,"" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang's urbanism, in a phone interview. ""They didn't have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can't achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.

""If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That's the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.""

According to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country's symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)

""It's a very iconic building, but I think it's important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,"" said Chua. ""It's like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome's St. Peter's Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it's also more symbolically defined.""

A second start

In 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea's 3G network.

The rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel's opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was ""not currently possible.""

Long-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was ""not done properly,"" according to North Korean state media reports.

""Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,"" said Chua. ""I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.""

Photographs of the hotel's interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.

""It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,"" he said in a phone interview. ""First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.

""It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.""

Although its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn't open.

A brighter future?

The Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang's biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea's history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.

""It's really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,"" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. ""I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it's not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.""

In recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply ""The Ryugyong Hotel"" in Korean and English.

The question remains: Will it ever open? ""It's very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can't see inside,"" said Cockerell. ""No doubt something's going on. It's a very large building. It's not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open. If it was my building, I'd focus on the top and the bottom.""

The Ryugyong Hotel is no longer the tallest building in the Korean peninsula: The Lotte World Tower in Seoul, completed in 2017, surpassed it by nearly 800 feet (240 meters). It is still the tallest in North Korea, although Pyongyang has seen a growth spurt of high-rise residential towers recently, with the tallest being just 197 feet (60 meters) shorter than the Ryugyong.

For years, to avoid embarrassment, the North Korean government has airbrushed the building from official pictures of Pyongyang. But the installation of the LED lighting may signal that there's a plan for its future.

""I think the North Korean government would definitely like to do something with it,"" said Ripley. ""For years, it was an embarrassing eyesore -- especially before the glass exterior was installed. I imagine if they do finish it, and Kim Jong Un makes an inspection and it's all over the state media, it will be more widely acknowledged as a proud centerpiece of the city.

""Personally, I think it would be fascinating to see what they do with the inside and go all the way to the top. I'm sure the views are extraordinary."""
430,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/alex-rotter-christies-auction/index.html,The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

In November 2017 at Christie's New York, Alex Rotter uttered a phrase never before heard at an art auction: ""Four hundred million.""

His bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.

After fees, the ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.

But it wasn't Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.

""I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,"" he recalled to CNN on the phone. ""Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.""

""It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), 'Do you want to?' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.

""Normally I'd just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, 'It's $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?'

""At this level you can't mess up -- you can't (get it) wrong,"" he added.

It's a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie's has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder's identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.

The moment Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450 million.

""I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,"" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: ""(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I've experienced in my 20 years of auctions.""

Art world matchmaker

Austrian-born Rotter, Christie's chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn't be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.

His auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is ""quite stressful"" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what's happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer's words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, ""a big no-no,"" Rotter stressed).

Many of Rotter's interlocutors are long-term clients. So he's also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter's own admission, there's an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called ""buyer's premium"" at Christie's ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).

What might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don't always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.

""I've heard people on the telephone say, 'Alex, let's just buy it, no matter how far it goes,' and I've heard people (say), 'I have a limit, and don't even ask me if we reach (it) because I don't want to be tempted,'"" revealed Rotter.

""People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.

""Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you're in the bidding process and it's a little bit of a race. People don't like to lose.""

In recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called ""phone bank,"" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney's ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.

""Rabbit,"" by Jeff Koons, is now the most expensive artwork by a living artist to ever sell at auction. Credit: Courtesy Christie's

This record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons' $91.1-million ""Rabbit"" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn't on the winning client's side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.

Indeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian's work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors' portfolios and tracking down the world's most sought-after paintings.

'Dream of big numbers'

Identifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons' ""Rabbit"" to auction began with Rotter's personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: ""I remember saying to my colleagues, 'one day...'"" he recalled.

Even at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data ""substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,"" Rotter said.

Hailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother's booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.

""My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn't want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,"" he recalled. ""But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.""

Thirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it's often Rotter's job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item's valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (""In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run"").

For the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie's courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them ""dream of big numbers,"" as Rotter recalled.

""People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn't just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.

""There was some price resistance,"" he added, ""Hockney's world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.""

But while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie's top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.

""At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.""

Market pressures

With collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.

In July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren't for the $450 million auction of the ""Salvator Mundi"" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller's huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie's, too.

This recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS' authoritative Global Art Market Report

But sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.

With their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie's is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby's).

It's still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire François Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.

""There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it's still wooden benches (and) telephones,"" he said. ""There's obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.

""People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,"" he added. ""It's serious art we're selling, but it's still an event.""

Moreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork's market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: ""Who bids the most gets the painting. There's no trickery, there's no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That's the beauty of it.""

When it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can't have?

""There are a handful of objects,"" Rotter said. ""I'm not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.

""Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.

""You always try,"" he concluded, adding: ""Always shoot for the masterpieces.""

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chloé, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Hermès-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

Dolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

Also instantly recognizable is the artist behind the picture, which has pride of place at an exhibition in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Haque, better known as Zunar, has spent most of the last decade lampooning Najib and Rosmah, even as the risks for doing so grow ever greater.

Zunar's work welcomes visitors to ""Democracy in Action,"" a recent exhibition that would have been impossible to stage only a year ago. In one cartoon, a hand holding chopsticks marked ""China"" reaches over to pluck Malaysia off a platter marked ""1MDB scandal."" In another, a huge diamond ring, a handbag and a bag of cash come together, Transformers-style, to form an image of Rosmah.

At the center sits Zunar's motto: ""How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand.""

That motto has been severely tested in recent times. Just last year, it seemed almost certain that Zunar would end up in prison. A number of his books had been banned, and while his work was still widely shared online, the artist faced multiple charges of sedition and committing acts deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Unknown assailants attacked him at a gallery show, police seized his works and he was banned from leaving the country.

Then, in a shock election result, a coalition of opposition parties turfed Najib out of office, promising to clamp down on corruption and reverse the country's turn toward authoritarianism.

Now Zunar is watching as his the political figures who were once his nemeses and muses face decades behind bars themselves -- in part because artists like him helped bring attention to their alleged corruption and disdain for the rule of law.

Zunar tells CNN that it's his mission to save Malaysia. Credit: James Griffiths/CNN

""The medium of cartooning is (a) very powerful medium,"" Zunar told CNN at his small studio in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. ""Everywhere, in any country you go, (cartoonists) get killed. Cartoonists, get arrested, put in jail everywhere because of the medium.""

Fellow artist Fahmi Reza, who also faced prosecution under Najib, said this is partly because of cartoons' unique ability to poke fun at those in power.

""Using satire and humor is effective because it breaks the fear barrier,"" he said in a phone interview.

""People had always been afraid to speak out. The culture of fear is always there; the culture of self-censorship is always there. That's where satire and humor can be the most effective tool, it makes people less afraid.""

Cartoonist's muse

After a number of false starts, Zunar's career as a political cartoonist was flagging when his nemesis emerged on the political scene in the 1990s.

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Najoib's wife Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Credit: Zunar

In many ways, the artist's career trajectory rose in tandem with that of Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers who climbed quickly through the ranks of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, initially as deputy prime minister and then to the premiership itself in 2009.

As Najib's star grew, so did the frustration of his critics. Detractors delighted in seeing him brought back down to Earth by Zunar's increasingly exaggerated, grotesque portrayals.

More even than Najib however, Zunar found his muse in Rosmah. He did, however, face more difficulty publishing cartoons of her, versus those of the Prime Minister.

""When my book came out with Najib on the cover, I could at least release it,"" Zunar said. When Rosmah was the subject however, ""the police came and stopped the launch ... (from this) we can understand that maybe that she is more powerful.""

According to prosecutors in Malaysia and the US, Rosmah used her position to accumulate luxury goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When police raided the couple's properties in Kuala Lumpur last year, they seized jewelry and gemstones worth over $109 million. Around $13 million worth of Hermès handbags were also confiscated, along with cash and other goods totaling over $100 million.

Many of the items were, allegedly, purchased with money embezzled from the 1MDB state investment fund, set up by Najib. Rosmah has pleaded not guilty, and due to numerous delays in the legal system, has yet to end up in court.

The 1MDB scandal -- and Rosmah's spending -- became a central theme of Zunar's work. In particular, the artist sought to make a connection between the allegedly embezzled funds and the Malaysian people: One cartoon showed Najib milking a 1MDB cow, while ordinary citizens were left with the animal's waste.

""Zunar has such a finely developed sense of what is right and what is fair,"" said Robert Russell, executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International. ""Like any good political cartoonist he has this well-developed sense of righteous indignation.""

Russell said Zunar's cartoons were so effective, in part, because they undercut concerted efforts by the government to present itself, particularly overseas, as a legitimate and clean administration. Using a combination of journalism and art, Zunar highlighted the instances where this was not the case.

But doing so would ultimately endanger his freedom, as Najib's government took a hard authoritarian turn in an attempt to stifle criticism.

Clowning around

Beginning in 2010, Zunar was questioned multiple times under the Sedition Act , a colonial-era law widely denounced by human rights groups as draconian.

In 2016, he was charged with taking actions deemed ""detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" over a series of cartoons depicting government corruption. Police seized hundreds of his books, and unknown assailants attacked him at an exhibition.

Later that year, Zunar was slapped with a travel ban after he visited Geneva to accept the Cartooning for Peace Award. The ban, according to free-speech group IFEX, ""appear(ed) to be an attempt to damp down the growing international publicity (surrounding) Zunar and his work.""

Zunar was not the only artist to face blowback for satirizing Najib. In June 2016, Fahmi Reza was charged with two counts of violating section 233(1) of the Communications and Multimedia Act, which forbids disseminating online content deemed to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass others.

Fahmi had depicted Najib as a clown with big red lips and arched, thick eyebrows. The image quickly caught on with Malaysians sick of the widespread allegations of corruption, and it soon became a common sight at anti-government protests.

Like Zunar, Fahmi had a record of trouble with the authorities. In 2004 , he designed a poster for a demonstration against police brutality, and volunteered to help print and distribute leaflets and other materials.

Unfortunately for him, Fahmi's conscientiousness was his downfall. Arriving ahead of most other protesters, police saw him with a large number of posters and banners. He was quickly arrested.

""I panicked and I was afraid,"" Fahmi told CNN. ""But I think surviving that made me bolder, knowing that the poster I made was having an effect on these people who abused their power.""

When he was arrested again in 2016, Fahmi was ""fully prepared,"" he said.

""One sign that whatever you're doing is effective is when the authorities and people in power react,"" he added. ""If they ignore it, then there's no impact. That's how the whole clown thing became a symbol of protest -- because of the overreaction by the authorities.""

Satire as a weapon

Both cartoonists' arrests made international headlines, helping to highlight Najib's growing authoritarianism to the outside world. Protesters also delighted in using the caricatures of Najib and Rosmah on posters and placards after it was revealed how much the artists had irritated them.

As Malaysia's opposition grew ever more determined to oust Najib -- with many observers warning that 2016's general election might be their last chance to do so -- the government passed new legislation to control what people could say about it.

In early 2018, it introduced a new law to crack down on ""fake news"" that critics said was so broadly defined that it could easily be used to shut down and criminalize criticism of Najib.

Eventually however, the wave of dissent was too great for Najib to overcome. Even though the electoral map was redrawn in his favor, he lost heavily. With an 82.32% turnout, an opposition coalition led by current Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad took 121 of 222 seats. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition won just 79.

Uncertain future

Since Najib's downfall, charges against Zunar and Fahmi have been dropped, though the latter is still fighting to have an earlier conviction overturned.

Both men said that, while they felt considerably freer under the new government, true reform has yet to be delivered.

Zunar has faced considerable restrictions on his work in the past, struggling against Malaysia's laws on speech and expression. Credit: Zunar

""(The government is) more tolerant toward online dissent and criticism -- and even insults,"" Fahmi said, despite the fact that the ""online content"" law used to prosecute him is still on the books.

""People know it's still there, so I think some people are still afraid to voice their criticism openly,"" Fahmi said.

Zunar said the new government's most important task is to ""repair the damage"" done by previous regimes. He is willing to give them time to do so, but as for the future, ""we don't know yet.""

Russell, of Cartoonists Rights Network International, said Zunar faces a situation similar to that of other dissident cartoonists when their former oppressors leave office.

In the last year of Najib's rule, Zunar was banned from leaving the country. Credit: Zunar

""Even with Zunar's heroes ... now in a new government, he's going to start drawing the same cartoons about them,"" he said. ""This is not necessarily a happy ending. If Zunar is true to his roots, he will be as ruthless with the new government as any (other) government.

In the short term, Zunar is facing a more pressing concern: the loss of his muse, Rosmah.

While she has largely disappeared from Malaysia's political scene while her husband attempts to reinvent himself as a man-of-the-people government critic, the former prime minister's wife remains present inside Zunar's studio, her cartoon face staring up from numerous books and picture frames.

""I miss Rosmah,"" the artist said. ""For me, she was a god send. Very easy to draw, very cartoonable. Her character is very cartoonable.

""As a cartoonist, I miss her. When Trump goes one day, American cartoonists will miss him too."""
433,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/lingerie-designers-inclusivity/index.html,The designers changing the conversation around lingerie,"Written by Jessica Rapp, CNN

For decades, padded push-up bras, lace-lined bodysuits and slim, voluptuous Victoria's Secret models have shaped public perceptions of what ""sexy"" looks like. But a growing number of lingerie brands are responding to discontent from consumers who want to see themselves better represented.

From offering a wider range of cup sizes and ""nude"" shades, to celebrating diversity in campaigns and on runways, intimate apparel labels are selling more than bras. They're selling inclusivity, too.

Lingerie is set to become a $59 billion market globally by 2024, up from $38 billion in 2017, according to Zion Market Research. And as sales grow, tastes also appear to be shifting.

Sales figures published by retail technology firm, Edited, suggest that bralettes and sports bras are increasingly preferred to cleavage-enhancing push-up bras. Victoria's Secret may still lead the pack with a reported 24% market share in the US, but it recently announced plans to shutter more than 50 stores following slow holiday season sales.

Brands like ThirdLove are catering to an increasingly diverse customer base. Credit: Courtesy Third Love

The closures come amid growing competition from newer brands, many of which are catering to broader tastes. Customers are embracing lingerie that encompasses alternative forms of sex appeal, and increasingly buying from brands that prioritize body positivity, comfort and proper fit.

Sizing up

Independent labels, like US startup ThirdLove, have filled a gap in the market by serving women who struggle to find bras in the right size. When Heidi Zak co-founded the brand in 2011, she simply wanted to provide bras that fit better than those at her previous go-to store, Victoria's Secret.

Using 600 million data points across metrics including breast shape and cup fit, ThirdLove promotes half-cup sizes. Today, the online-only brand offers 78 different sizes -- and is worth an estimated $750 million, according to Forbes

The unseen history of underwear

But offering more sizes can be an expensive endeavor. The inflexibility of factory production makes it difficult to cater to everyone, according to Cora Harrington, author of the book ""In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie.""

""There are so many parts to a bra, sizes and variations to breasts, that it's impossible for any one brand to service every single bra-wearing customer adequately,"" she said in a phone interview.

According to Harrington, who also founded the Lingerie Addict blog, a single bra can contain at least 20 individual components, including lace, closures and straps. For a luxury garment, this number can swell to 40 or 50, she said.

Add the precision sewing and pattern-making required to adjust for different sizes, then piece everything together, and it can create a product that costs more than ""what people feel is appropriate to pay for a bra.""

""(To) serve an adequate range of people,"" Harrington added, ""you're looking at 50 to 60 sizes to start, which is far beyond what most indie designers or new brands are able to afford.

""Consumer expectations are a little bit misaligned with product design and development ... people are used to fast-fashion cycles (and seeing) something on a runway, then seeing a knock-off two weeks later.""

Some lingerie makers have nonetheless found ways to profitably expand their size ranges, contributing to what Harrington calls a ""bra size war."" Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, for instance, produces lingerie for plus-size body types (up to 3X and 44DDD) in addition to straight sizes, with other labels going up to 46H or higher.

Diverse customers

The growing lingerie market is providing greater choice to another group of customers it has traditionally underserved: transgender shoppers.

Montreal-based Origami Customs offers gender-affirming lingerie to transgender customers, among others. With trans visibility at an all-time high, the brand has doubled sales over the last four years, according to founder Rae Hill.

The label has recently expanded its line of binders, an undergarment used to flatten the chest, that it models on transmasculine customers. Gaffs, a type of underwear used for tucking, make up nearly half of the products that Origami Customs sells.

""I've felt an outpouring of gratitude from my customers (especially trans women) about the affirming process of working with me,"" Hill said in an email interview.

""I take the time to work with each customer one-on-one, and I do feel that this creates a level of safety and intimacy that isn't available in the mainstream market.""

""Being sexy is as different as each one of us,"" Hill added.

Racial diversity is also a growing force in the lingerie market. Take Rihanna's aforementioned label, which has been praised for producing a variety of ""nude"" tones for different skin colors. Similarly, ThirdLove's recent line of T-shirt bras offers nine shades of ""naked.""

Before either of them, London-based disruptor Nubian Skin became one of the first brands to offer nude tones for women of color when it launched in 2014.

""We saw a lot of brands debut their own nude tones in the years immediately after the launch of Nubian Skin,"" Harrington said. ""Some of those brands have since rolled back (their selection) because they didn't market them very well -- if you're going to sell nude tone bras in deeper skin tones, it would help to use models of color.

""I hope that, for these companies (new brands like ThirdLove and Savage X) it's not a trend (but) something they plan to stick with.""

A matter of representation

Inclusivity isn't just about selling lingerie to diverse customers -- it's about doing so visibly. This means using models of all shapes, sizes and colors in fashion shows and campaigns.

Take Lonely Lingerie, for instance, which claims to portray women in a realistic way by refusing to use Photoshop -- or even hair and makeup stylists -- in its campaigns. The brand's models include women with 35 different bra sizes and from a variety of backgrounds.

Founder Helene Morris said that, when she started the label in 2009, ""there was no one in the lingerie world who was speaking in a way we related to at all."" Her brand's ""Lonely Girls"" project featured senior models, breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women and disabled women, all photographed in natural light.

""We really wanted to give the power ... to the person being shot -- how they want to be shot, how are they most comfortable and involving the woman in that process,"" Morris said in a phone interview.

Plus-size label Curvy Couture also sees the use of diverse models as an important step towards inclusivity, according to social media marketing manager, Summer Rose.

Curvy Couture is ""designed, owned and operated by curvy women, for curvy women,"" said the company's social media marketing manager. Credit: Courtesy Curvy Couture

""We have a ton of fit models that come in -- different sizes, different ages, moms who are post-breastfeeding -- just so we can really make sure that the fit is supportive,"" she said in a phone interview. ""No matter what stage in life she is in, we want to make sure she feels her best."""
434,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/india-election-party-symbols/index.html,"Ceiling fans, brooms and mangoes: The election symbols of India's political parties","Written by Manveena Suri, CNN Oscar Holland, CNN

A ceiling fan, a bungalow, a broom and a mango -- these are just some of unusual symbols Indian voters can expect to see on their ballots as they head to the polls over the coming weeks.

An array of minimalist -- and often hand-drawn -- logos feature alongside candidates' names on electronic voting machines across India during its general election, the world's largest democratic exercise. The symbols help the dozens of participating parties to differentiate themselves from one another, while making it easier for voters to make their choice in a country where around a quarter of the population is illiterate.

But although it's common for party symbols to represent values or ideologies, India's system differs in an important way: Rather than designing logos themselves, parties must instead choose from a pre-existing list controlled by election officials.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) currently maintains a pool of thousands of symbols. The images represent aspects of everyday life in India, from a stack of tires and a gramophone, to an auto rickshaw and even a cricket player.

Parties must choose three symbols, in order of preference, after which they are allocated one by the ECI. Once an image is ""reserved,"" it cannot be used by any other party, leaving new entrants to pick from a list of ""free"" symbols.

Easy to recognize

Hundreds of logos have been allocated going into this month's elections, which will see the country select candidates for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, alongside a number of state-level polls.

There are, currently, a further 200 unclaimed images, according to a list published by the ECI last month. Among the logos still up for grabs are an air conditioning unit, a tube of toothpaste and a vacuum cleaner.

Many of the symbols are, in fact, the work of a single artist: M. S. Sethi, who for decades served as a draftsman for the ECI.

First hired in the 1950s, as India organized its first post-independence elections, Sethi would sit with officials as they discussed everyday objects that could be easily remembered and identified by voters. He reportedly sketched his early symbols in pencil.

Sethi retired from the commission in the 1990s, although many of his designs remain in -- or available for -- use. New images reflecting contemporary life have also been added to the list, including a phone charger and a USB pen drive.

Campaign devices

These seemingly simple logos can be crucial campaigning tools. They are visible across India during election time -- on banners, billboards, pamphlets and other materials -- as political groups vie for voters' attention.

But although parties use designs allocated to them, many have, over the years, become synonymous with their symbols.

Take the lotus, for instance, which denotes current Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Or the raised, open-palmed hand that serves as a visual calling card for the main opposition, the Indian National Congress (INC).

In both instances, party symbols have evolved to possess significant political capital -- as evidenced by the wrangling that has occurred during internal party divisions. (When a split occurs within a party, the ECI decides which faction can continue using its symbol, with breakaway parties forced to return to the list of available images).

World's tallest statue unveiled in India

Between 1952 and 1969, the Congress was represented by a pair of bulls pulling a yoke. A series of internal ruptures mean that today, when voters who wish to vote for the INC enter the polling booth, they'll have to look for the raised palm.

The changes result from internal splits dating back to the late 1960s, and the current symbol did not come into common use until the late 1970s.

The BJP, meanwhile, traces its origins back to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh party, which, from 1955 to 1977, used an oil lamp as its logo. In 1977, the group merged with other parties to form the Janata Party, adopting a farmer and plough as its new symbol.

Three years later, the Janata Party was dissolved and its members established what is today known as the BJP. It was allocated a lotus symbol, which the party continues to use to this day."
435,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/ruth-bader-ginsburg-collars/index.html,The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN

This article was originally published in August 2018.

Sometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.

Ginsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those ""disappeared"" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.

Today, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.

Beyond a feminizing touch

Given her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.

In adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.

Beyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.

There is her favorite ""majority"" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her ""dissenting"" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in ""Ruth"") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).

When espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.

When worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.

But those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not ""wear"" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least""straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as ""mind"" or ""spirit,"" while women represent the baser realms of ""body"" and ""flesh.""

Re-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes

To clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.

This risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.

Ginsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of ""body"" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.

To re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most ""noticeable"" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).

Ginsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.

And finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.

This has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary ""RBG"" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in ""RBG drag,"" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: ""Imagine yourself here! This could be you!""

Of course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her ""dissenting"" collar."
436,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/serpentine-pavilion-beijing-jiakun-architects/index.html,Why Beijing's Serpentine Pavilion signals a new age for Chinese architecture,"Written by Aric Chen

Aric Chen is Lead Curator for Design and Architecture at M+ , the new museum of visual culture under construction in Hong Kong.

Upon first seeing digital renderings of architect Liu Jiakun's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing -- a row of 38 steel rods pulled taut by cables, like fishing poles bearing a formidable catch -- many were struck by its audacious simplicity.

As a first foray outside Britain for the Serpentine Gallery's hugely successful series of temporary pavilions (they have previously been built in London's Kensington Park and designed by heavyweight architects like Zaha Hadid, Sou Fujimoto and Bjarke Ingels) one might have anticipated a bit more flamboyance. Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.

We should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum

But mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as ""low-tech,"" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.

""His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,"" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.

Liu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural ""realism."" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.

Centered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.

But as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them "" Rebirth Bricks "") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.

Shifting attitudes

A stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.

Even the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.

Often small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.

""He's the right architect at the right time,"" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.

According to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of ""junzi,"" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.

""I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,"" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. ""It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.""

Put another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).

Nonetheless, naming Liu as the designer of Beijing's inaugural Serpentine Pavilion was an inspired choice. Less than 20 years ago, Liu had become one of the very first architects to open a private practice in post-reform China, joining a field that was previously monopolized by state design institutes.

The country's architecture has had some catching up to do. But it says something about recent years that now we speak not only about how far it has to go, but of how far it has come."
437,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-art-dealer-pier-luigi-cecioni/index.html,Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West,"Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish

In a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.

The pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.

Cecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.

Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.

""Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'"" Cecioni said in his studio. ""They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'""

With over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.

The best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.

Cecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.

Cecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. ""Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,"" he said. ""They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.""

How Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: ""There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,"" he said.

Sanctions taking effect

Beyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.

The sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.

Cecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.

""This money is highly significant,"" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. ""We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.""

Cecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.

""It's like a big art company, there are many branches,"" he said. ""The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).""

Cecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.

Despite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.

""The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,"" he said. ""I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.""

Cecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. ""The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,"" he said.

Best-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.

But while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.

But instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.

""We are not really trying to sell anymore,"" he said, ""because we cannot replenish our inventory."""
438,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/david-hockney-at-80-interview-los-angeles/index.html,David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist,"David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.

The ""English Angelino,"" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.

We are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.

David Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist

The studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.

We hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.

I'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).

“ I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. ” David Hockney

Making polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.

Hockney quickly interjects: ""Yes, they are just big voids,"" he says, referring to the TV screens. ""I don't like voids.""

Painting the pool

Hockney says that his swimming pool was also looking ""a bit like a void,"" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.

""Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,"" he says. The job took him two and half hours, ""and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.""

Hockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. ""Of course, I thought I could do it,"" he says a little defiantly.

He admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's ""a bit too pale"" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- ""Gregory wouldn't like it.""

A bigger retrospective

The pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,"" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.

I ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). ""Well,"" comes the blunt reply, ""it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.""

We both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.

Throughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- ""Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.""

His father had been ""a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,"" he says with a certain relish.

Fish and chips

Having first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.

He has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.

""Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).""

Hockney has astonishing recall. There were only ""about five copies,"" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under £19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.

One of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid £5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. ""That was quite a lot of money then,"" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.

Hockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.

A gay pioneer

Hockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, ""Adhesiveness,"" for less than $60.

""I remember delivering it to his house,"" he tells me. ""He had it for 40 years."" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.

We sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures ""look rather good and stand up,"" he says.

'I feel 30 in the studio'

It's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.

Hockney likes to paint in silence, ""to look, and look again."" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was ""amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.""

Hockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.

Hanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.

The image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.

Every day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. ""I'm perfectly happy doing this,"" he says. ""I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.""

Hockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know ""what to do straight away"" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.

Our interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.

He doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.

""Travelling, I feel 80,"" he says poignantly.

A bigger book

For almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: ""Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.""

A crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of ""A Bigger Book,"" a 77-pound ""sumo"" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.

""Well, I realized,"" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, ""that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?""

""A Bigger Splash"" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate

His own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. ""I keep looking through it,' he admits.

""I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,"" he muses. ""Every day I've done what I want to do.""

""That's a privilege', I say. ""I know I'm privileged,"" comes the reply, ""I've always known that I was privileged.""

Hanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: ""Thank you for brightening our world.""

""That was OK, wasn't it?"" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. ""Yes,"" I exclaim, ""more than OK. Thank you!"" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.

On camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- ""with love, David and a kiss"" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.

439,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/shenzhen-effect-china-model-city-intl-hnk/index.html,The Shenzhen effect: Why China's original 'model' city matters more than ever,"Written by Jonathan Chatwin, CNN

Jonathan Chatwin is a writer, journalist and author of books including "" Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China .""

By 2035, China's government expects over 70% of the country's population -- around a billion people -- to be living in cities.

Both Shanghai and Beijing have announced population limits and are implementing policies to reduce the number of new arrivals. These restrictions look likely to be replicated in many of China's more populous cities.

But the rate of urbanization shows no sign of slowing. So, while existing smaller cities can absorb some of the millions who relocate, China is, with increasing haste, looking to develop entirely new urban areas in order to provide homes, jobs and infrastructure -- all while driving economic growth.

The most high-profile of these is Xiongan, a new city being built across three counties in Hebei province, 100 kilometers to Beijing's south west. Announced to great fanfare in April 2017, it's expected to house up to 2.5 million people . Large-scale construction began in 2019 and, over the next decade, an ambitious government plan will see many of Beijing's businesses, universities and hospitals relocated to this new city, alleviating pressure on the capital and encouraging hi-tech economic development in a traditionally industrial area.

Across the country, China's government is investing trillions of yuan to establish new areas and development zones, many of which act as satellites to existing cities. To the south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Tianfu New Area has been developed over the last decade and is soon set to open Unicorn Island , a 166-acre technology hub designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. In Changsha, capital of Hunan province, the vast and similarly ambitious Xiangjiang New Area is intended to attract hi-tech industry and is home to the country's first test zone for autonomous public transport.

These projects all look back to one city for inspiration: the godfather of urban transformation and the country's ""model"" city, Shenzhen. Now home to over 13 million people, the southern metropolis is the Chinese government's proudest symbol of the last 40 years of economic reform.

Building on Shenzhen

On September 4, 1984, the sound of firecrackers echoed through the streets of Shenzhen as the city celebrated the completion of the International Trade Center, its -- and, at the time, China's -- tallest building.

Deng Xiaoping, the country's then paramount leader, had visited the site earlier that year and had given the project his seal of approval. He was particularly impressed by the speed of construction, which -- though it began slowly, partly due to a lack of proper equipment -- eventually reached a rate of one new floor every three days. The pace with which the upper floors of the tower were built became known as ""Shenzhen speed,"" part of the pervasive mythology that clouds the origins of this so-called ""Instant City.""

For visitors to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the 50-story skyscraper dominated the city's skyline. Over time, however, neighboring buildings would reach, and then exceed, the International Trade Center. As Juan Du, an architect and author of new book ""The Shenzhen Experiment"" observed in an email interview: ""This cluster of tall buildings became the image of China's post-reform modernization and urbanization.""

Special Economic Zones

As China began reforming its economic system and opening up to the world, a process initiated by Deng in the late 1970s, Shenzhen was established as one of China's first four ""Special Economic Zones,"" or SEZs. All four were chosen for their favorable geographical position and access to global markets, with Shenzhen located just across the river from the international hub of Hong Kong.

An oft-repeated myth is that Shenzhen grew from a fishing village. But in 1980 it was already a bustling market town. The surrounding areas that would become the SEZ covered almost 330 square kilometers and included a number of other pre-existing villages and towns. The official population of the SEZ at the time was 94,100, according to Du's research.

Although Shenzhen is now considered a success story, its establishment and early development was not without controversy. The city was, as Deng acknowledged, an experiment, and thus diverged from rules that applied to the rest of China. Shenzhen was allowed to try out comparatively radical ideas, like loosening price controls on goods and inviting foreign direct investment.

Shenzhen was such an exception that, for much of its existence, it was physically separated from the rest of the country by a barbed wire fence. This fortified perimeter was interspersed with seven manned checkpoints and was known as the ""Second Line"" (the first being the border with the semi-autonomous Hong Kong to the south).

Until 2006, visitors from other parts of China needed their passports and a special permit to enter the SEZ.

When Deng visited in 1984, he asserted that SEZs were ""windows of technology, management, knowledge and foreign policy,"" designed to showcase China's potential to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the country. The city was intended to become a ""national model for China's modernization and urbanization,"" Du said.

Architecture and design became crucial ways of representing this model vision of modern China. The country's urban spaces have long emphasized the importance of symmetry, with streets traditionally laid out in straight lines running east to west and north to south. Following these principles, Shenzhen initially spread out along its first east-west avenue, whilst the city's main Central Business District was laid out along a prominent north to south axis, flanked by skyscrapers and landmark architectural projects.

Shenzhen was not, however, a blank slate onto which a symmetrically ordered city could be drawn. Existing villages within the boundaries of the Special Economic Zone grew exponentially, as they were often the first destinations for the thousands of newcomers looking for an affordable place to live.

Those who owned village properties would quickly extend their houses upwards and outwards to offer low-rent accommodation for new arrivals. ""Without the villages, the city would never have grown with the famous 'Shenzhen speed,'"" Jonathan Bach wrote in ""Learning from Shenzhen,"" a collection of essays on the city. ""The city could never have sustained the cost of housing and supporting so much labor.""

However, over time, the villages have been surrounded and overshadowed by new, more lucrative developments -- or razed by developers seeking new opportunities for growth.

As Du observed in ""The Shenzhen Experiment,"" many people in China share a stereotyped view of the surviving villages as being ""dirty, disorderly and inferior,"" though they have been integral in driving Shenzhen's success, and their vibrancy and dynamism are a key aspect of the city's culture. There are still hundreds of these ""urban villages,"" and one of the unresolved challenges in Shenzhen's development is how to sensitively manage and integrate them -- and the millions of people who live in them -- into an ever-growing metropolis that leaders like to promote as an orderly, model city.

A new city center

Shenzhen has proven such a success that it's now faced with a problem unimaginable to its original planners: A lack of space.

One source of new land has been found by building onto what was once the sea.

Through extensive land reclamation, the waterfront at the city's southern edge was extended into the bay almost 20 years ago. A new city center business district, dubbed Shenzhen Bay Headquarters City, is now being built on that land.

""We intend to make Shenzhen Bay a complementary city center to the string of existing central business districts of Shenzhen,"" said Claude Godefroy of Henning Larsen Architects, one of three firms to win a competition to design the new district, in an email interview.

With the first phase of building expected to be completed by 2022, the project features a north-south axis and showpiece skyscraper (the project's main tower will reach a height of over 1,640 feet, the architects said, placing it firmly in the world's 20 tallest buildings).

But beyond the superlatives, its design aims to correct the mistakes of the past. Although Shenzhen has been treated as a model city, the power of hindsight has exposed some of the original plan's shortcomings.

In a city where ""oversize impassable highways crisscross the city and isolate neighborhoods from each other,"" as Godefroy put it, Shenzhen Bay will be pedestrian friendly. A waterfront promenade will be lined with bars and restaurants, correcting ""an historic failure in Shenzhen's urban planning: its disconnection with the sea,"" he added. ""Citizens complain that they sometimes forget they are living in a coastal city.""

One of the project's goals is to attract skilled Chinese and international workers to the city. ""All megacities compete to attract the talents of tomorrow,"" Godefroy said, ""and Shenzhen lags behind in livability compared to Hong Kong.""

The idea of Shenzhen competing with neighboring Hong Kong, long a prosperous global trading hub, is hardly new. But a government plan published over the summer of 2019 directly declared its ambition for Shenzhen to itself become ""a capital of innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity with international influence.""

The plan emphasizes making the city more internationally open, developing its reputation as a technology hub -- it is already home to Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and ZTE, among others -- and improving its environmental credentials. It is to become a ""pioneering demonstration zone of socialism with Chinese characteristics"" according to the State Council , China's cabinet.

""The State Council document was not part of the brief for Shenzhen Bay, but every architect involved with Shenzhen knows that is the agenda,"" said Godefroy. Although he doesn't believe Shenzhen can become a true competitor to Hong Kong, as ""their economies have such a different focus,"" he said that the government's ambition for the new development was very clear -- it wants to ""make this district the spearhead of a plan to position Shenzhen a model city for China and the world.""

A model for China

China's politicians have persistently tried to replicate the ""Shenzhen effect"" as they develop other urban areas around the country.

These new areas often feature architectural motifs reminiscent of Shenzhen, sprawling along broad, perpendicular avenues flanked by convention centers, malls and flagship skyscrapers. And, like Shenzhen, they are generally built with economic revitalization in mind, with local governments often offering favorable terms to developers and companies relocating there.

Take Shanghai's Pudong district, across the river from the city's famous Bund, which drew inspiration from Shenzhen. In early 1990, Deng, who often wintered in Shanghai, began to encourage China's next generation of leaders to allow Pudong -- relatively rural in comparison to the city it faced across the water -- to redevelop, saying that he had made a mistake by not including Shanghai in the original group of Special Economic Zones in 1979. According to Ezra Vogel's 2011 biography of Deng, the paramount leader argued the city could, at least, benefit from developing later than Shenzhen by learning the lessons of its predecessor.

Pudong has since become home to a famed skyline punctuated by some of China's tallest buildings, and the center of the country's financial sector. The district's planning and development was certainly more centralized and coordinated than that of Shenzhen, but despite innovative plans proposed by international architecture firms, Pudong ended up re-articulating the same ideas of urban development: build quickly and ambitiously, maximize land value and prioritize the commercial over the human.

Beyond Pudong, China has struggled to successfully export Shenzhen's remarkable example. Even the other three SEZs established at the same time as Shenzhen -- Shantou, Xiamen and Zhuhai -- failed to develop in anything like the same explosive manner. A myriad of different factors has influenced this -- geography, size and scale, specific local policies and the nature of the cities' populations. As Du noted in her book, ""Shenzhen ... is not a singular transferable model but a plurality, informed by local conditions and local communities.""

Xiongan, Xi's model city

Beijing's new satellite city, Xiongan, is China's latest attempt to replicate the success of Shenzhen. President Xi Jinping has appointed Shenzhen's former mayor and party chief, Xu Qin, as governor of Hebei province, where the city is being built. State media has referred to Xiongan as the "" Shenzhen of the North "" while, according to its master plan, the project is intended to become ""a model city in the history of human development.""

There are differences between Xiongan's development and that of Shenzhen, however. Most obviously, whereas all of the original Special Economic Zones were coastal areas designed to attract foreign capital, Xiongan is 150 kilometers from the nearest coastline.

It will mainly serve a center for domestic, rather than international, industries -- in particular, many of the country's massive state-owned enterprises currently based in Beijing.

The government also emphasizes that Xiongan will be a green ""smart city,"" built on a more human scale and with lower population density than China's sprawling megacities. The city will be comparatively low-rise, and free from the ever-taller skyscrapers that define most new urban developments. Early work has focused on improving environmental conditions in what is one of the most polluted areas of China, with the sizeable Baiyangdian Lake -- around which the city will be oriented -- subject to an intensive clean-up operation.

As with Shenzhen, Xiongan must also navigate the complexities of managing the area's existing population. When Xiongan was first announced, a rush of real estate trading led the government to freeze property sales.

The government has subsequently restricted speculation further by announcing that housing in Xiongan will be subject to strict state controls -- a substantial change to the policy of Shenzhen, where property development was a key driver of economic growth.

Many of the existing residents have already been relocated and compensated. But with a population of around 1 million people in the area -- and over 500 villages to be redeveloped -- enabling satisfactory outcomes for low-income and often older rural residents remains problematic.

One key similarity between the two cities, however, is in the way Xiongan will be integrated into a greater conglomeration of urban centers. Just as Shenzhen now blends almost imperceptibly into the Pearl River Delta's other cities, such as Guangzhou and Dongguan, so Xiongan will be connected via high-speed rail with Beijing and Tianjin, to its east, to form a 130-million-person megalopolis nicknamed 'Jing-Jin-Ji' (a portmanteau of the names of Beijing, Tianjin and ""Ji,"" an ancient name for Hebei province).

There is clearly no lack of ambition for Xiongan. It is a project that reflects the ambitions and concerns of China's current leadership, with Xi seemingly hoping to emulate Deng's legacy in Shenzhen by very publicly attaching his name to the project. ""General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted (Xiongan) in person, devoting painstaking efforts,"" read a 2018 planning document.

The extent to which Xiongan will copy -- or diverge from -- the template established by the model city of Shenzhen remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that Shenzhen's example, both positive and negative, remains hugely influential in China's urban planning, even four decades after the city was established."

A rare copy of Shakespeare's First Folio sold for almost $10 million Wednesday, becoming the most expensive work of literature ever to appear at auction, according to Christie's.

The collection of 36 plays, published shortly after the playwright's death, is one of only five complete copies still in private hands, the auction house said.

The First Folio is considered among the most important collections of literature in the English language. It contains 18 works that had not previously appeared in print, and would otherwise have been lost to history, including ""Macbeth"" and ""Twelfth Night.""

Published in 1623 by the actors John Heminge and Henry Condell, friends of the English playwright, the book is formally titled ""Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies,"" based on the three genres the pair used to categorize the plays.

The version sold on Wednesday was the first complete copy to appear at auction since one went for $6.1 million in 2001. It was put up for sale by Mills College in Oakland, California, which had kept the item in its collection since 1977.

After a six-minute bidding battle between three telephone buyers, the item was purchased by book dealer and antiquarian Stephan Loewentheil for $9.98 million. In a phone interview following the sale, he described Shakespeare's original folios as the ""holy grail of books.""

""(The First Folio) is the greatest work in the English language, certainly the greatest work of theater, so it's something that anyone who loves intellectualism has to consider a divine object,"" said Loewentheil, who owns stores specializing in rare books and photography in New York and Maryland.

In a press statement, head of books and manuscripts at Christie's, Margaret Ford, said it was ""befitting"" that Shakespeare's work now holds the auction world record ""given its tremendous significance and influence around the globe.""

'Extraordinarily' rare

Although around 750 copies of the First Folio were produced, just 235 are known to have survived to the present day. Of these, only 56 are considered to be complete, with almost all of them now held by institutions in the US and UK, according to Christie's, whose sale catalog said the item's ""extraordinary rarity ... cannot be overstated.""

Believing that the copies in private hands might ""never to come to market again,"" Loewentheil said that there may not be ""too many more chances left"" to obtain a copy.

The book came in a binding dating back to the early 19th century. It was sold alongside a letter by Shakespeare scholar Edmond Malone from 1809 confirming its authenticity.

Commenting on the book's condition, Loewentheil -- who was able to inspect it in person, before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered auction houses around the world -- described it as having ""integrity.""

""That is to say: Although it's had minor repairs over the years, there's a feeling that you get from the book ... as to whether it has integrity as an object,"" he explained. ""And that's somewhat subjective, which is why I was very glad to see the book myself.""

The final sale price exceeded the auction house's estimates, which had predicted top bids of $4 million to $6 million. A number of other items at Wednesday's sale sold for seven-figure sums -- including a Ming dynasty carpet that went under the hammer for over $1.7 million -- providing further evidence that the top end of the auction market is weathering some the challenges posed by the pandemic.

""For the great objects that really matter, the markets for art, literature and photographs have remained very strong,"" Loewentheil said."

As a young man in Beijing in the 1980s, Lun Zhang felt like he was taking part in a new Chinese enlightenment.

becoming newly available. The country was undergoing paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's "" Reform and Opening Up ,"" and previously sealed-off areas of knowledge, arts, and culture werebecoming newly available.

People who had only years before been living in the stifling, hyper-Maoist orthodoxy of the Cultural Revolution, in which anything foreign or historical was deemed counter-revolutionary, could now listen to Wham!, hold intellectual salons in which people read Jean-Paul Sartre or Sigmund Freud, or even publish their own works, taking aim at previously sacred political targets.

""In those days, our thirst to read, learn and explore the outside world was insatiable,"" Zhang writes in his new graphic novel, ""Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.""

But with this intellectual awakening came a growing frustration with the pace of reform in China, particularly how economic liberalization was taking precedence over any suggestion that the Communist Party give up its tight control on the country's politics.

An apocryphal quote attributed to Deng captured the mood at this time, that ""to get rich is glorious,"" but for many people, it was increasingly apparent that only a handful were becoming wealthy, while others were suffering due to growing corruption and the destruction of the social safety net.

Small demonstrations against graft and for greater political reform ballooned into what would become the 1989 Tiananmen movement , in which hundreds of thousands of people protested across the country, with the largest demonstration in Beijing led by workers and student groups.

The pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square for months, even holding meetings with top officials. At the time, many felt hopeful that these actions would bring about wider societal change in the one-party state.

Crackdown

Zhang was on the square that spring, when the protesters put forward seven demands, including for democratic elections and an end to state censorship. He was there as the crowds paid tribute to the late reformist leader Hu Yaobang, and he was there as the occupiers sang and danced on what had become the people's square.

He was not there when soldiers opened fire on protesters and fought with them in the streets of the Chinese capital. He was not there when the tanks rolled in. Zhang was in the suburbs of the city with another activist, recuperating in preparation for what some thought would be a last push before the government gave into the protesters' demands.

""When we heard the army had entered Beijing, we tried to reach the square, but our efforts were in vain,"" Zhang writes of when they learned of the bloodshed.

Far from reaching the center of the city, Zhang's attention turned to escape: the authorities were rounding up prominent protesters and leaders, and he was worried about arrest. He fled first to rural China, eventually becoming one of dozens of Tiananmen protesters smuggled into Hong Kong by activists in the then British colony.

Graphic novel

Zhang eventually moved to France, where he has lived ever since, and is teaching at the Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris. While he writes about the Chinese economy and geopolitics, he has largely left out his own personal history prior to this month's publication of his graphic novel.

""I worked with (French journalist) Adrien Gombeaud, who wrote the script for the format,"" Zhang told CNN. ""We read some graphic novels about historical events, and together came up with the plan, for example, to imagine a theater scene to link all the parts of the story.""

While the Tiananmen Square Massacre has been widely covered in the media and in documentaries, with many focusing on the iconic image of the Tank Man or utilizing archive footage from the square itself, much of the events leading up to the infamous night have been lost to history, available only through witnesses' accounts. Zhang said that the comics format provided a key means of capturing the emotion of the demonstrations, in a way that does not necessarily come across in text.

""It is difficult to find a satisfactory way in which this kind of big event is reported, in my opinion,"" he said. ""In some reporting on Tiananmen, the authors didn't reflect enough on the will of students to cooperate with the authorities in peacefully reforming China.

""When you take into account the emotion involved, we can understand why the peaceful way of demonstration was chosen, why there was the huge hunger strike.""

After the initial script was written, the authors worked with French artist Ameziane to develop the comic's visuals, by sourcing images of the various characters, and referencing archival photos of era-appropriate objects, such as clothes, cars and teacups from 1980s China. ""We spent a lot of time in discussions on how to arrange the scenes, how to convey the essential message, what limits we might have on a given page. It played to the style and skill of our painter,"" Zhang said.

The shift in artistic style is most notable in the scenes depicting the massacre itself. Prior pages feature white backgrounds and muted colors, but as the crackdown begins, the pages turn to black, with a heavy use of oranges and reds. Ameziane's illustrations become looser and full of movement, emphasizing the chaos and panic experienced by the characters.

The book is structured in several acts, with Zhang as its narrator. He said the play format was an obvious storytelling device, given ""the protest movement itself felt like a drama, with its different phases akin to great acts.""

Comics journalism

Zhang, Gombeaud and Ameziane's book joins what has quietly become a major strand of modern comics: graphic journalism or historical comics dealing with topics that were once considered out of the art form's remit.

American cartoonist Art Spiegelman's ""Maus,"" a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of his parents' experiences as Holocaust survivors -- with the Jews depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats -- has long been considered a masterwork in the graphic novel genre.

While adult themes and history were features in comics long before ""Maus"" debuted in 1980, including in Spiegelman's own work, its use of accessible, black and white art combined with a sweeping historical narrative broke into the mainstream, and set a new standard for ""grown up"" comics with political subject matter and potentially upsetting content.

Works like Maltese-American Joe Sacco's ground-breaking comics journalism in ""Palestine"" or ""Safe Area Gorazde,"" and French-Iranian Marjane Satrapi's ""Persepolis"" have further driven this trend, with the latter turned into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2007.

The popularity of comics and graphic novels has only grown in recent years -- with the help of blockbuster film adaptations. This has happened in conjunction with the rise of comics journalism, in everything from newspapers to dedicated publications such as The Nib , which has long recognized the medium's ability to tackle serious issues, interweaving reporting with satirical cartoons.

Sacco has talked about how the use of comics, the presentation of the artist and writer as a figure in the story, helps remove ""the illusion that a journalist is a fly on the wall, all seeing and all knowing.""

in a ""To me, drawing myself signals to the reader that I'm a filter between the information, the people and them. They know that I'm a presence, and that they're seeing things through my eyes,"" he saidin a recent interview

This is very much apparent in Zhang's book, as he uses his role as narrator to critique both the protest movement and himself.

Asked once about whether drawing helped him deal with being the child of Holocaust survivors, Spiegelman answered : ""I've had therapy, and I've made comics. The comics are cheaper.""

Part of ""Maus"" deals with Spiegelman's guilt over his difficult relationship with his father and in comparing his problems with depression and work to the experiences of his parents. Zhang too writes in ""Tiananmen"" of his own survivor's guilt and of questioning his decisions made as a younger man in the midst of history.

In an interview, Zhang said he did not write about Tiananmen for so long, because his role, his involvement, seemed inconsequential compared to what some went through.

""The way I saw it, there were many people dead or wounded in the aftermath, and many people lost their jobs; their families were never the same after,"" he said. ""The real heroes were the ordinary students and people in (Beijing) and other cities. By comparison, what I did personally didn't seem worth telling. The most important thing I could do was live my life in a way that wouldn't dishonor the dead.""

He was eventually convinced by an editor to write the book last year, around the 30th anniversary of the massacre. ""She convinced me that I had a duty to the memory of that time,"" Zhang said. ""I accepted it. 'No justice, no peace,' but I think also, 'No memory, no justice.'"""

A wedding party crams into a small car. Sharply-dressed men pose for the camera in a nightclub. A short-haired woman stands over a Vespa in a patterned dress and sunglasses.

Roger DaSilva's glamorous photos of 1950s and 1960s Senegal may have been shot in black and white, but they are alive with color.

Now, a new selection of the late photographer's images has been brought to light, after 75,000 of his long-lost negatives were found at his home. They paint a vibrant, celebratory picture of life in the West African country as it headed towards independence from colonial France.

Recovered from DaSilva's house by his son following his death in 2008, around 100 images from the archive have been painstakingly restored by the US-based Josef and Anni Albers Foundation. ""A lot of the negatives were somewhere between being in poor shape and almost total disintegration,"" said the organization's executive director, Nicholas Fox Weber, in a phone interview.

What they reveal is a rarely-seen world of jazz shows, nightclubs and stylish cars in Senegal's capital, Dakar. While DaSilva was primarily a portrait photographer, he also spent time documenting street scenes and weddings, among much else.

The restored photos were all taken in the decade before -- and years immediately after -- April 1960, when Senegal secured independence from France in one of the more peaceful and politically stable transitions from colonial rule.

But as well as demonstrating what Weber called ""a unique spirit of optimism"" in the postwar era, the archive also shines a light on the artistic sensibilities of a photographer whose legacy has been largely forgotten.

""When we know about Roger DaSilva -- and (what) is consistent in both his well-known work and these decrepit negatives -- is that he was, by instinct, drawn to the human smile, the human skills of dancing and making music, and human laughter,"" Weber said.

High society insider

The opulence depicted in the images seemingly reflects DaSilva's jet-setting lifestyle. The photographer operated among Senegal's burgeoning high society, and the restored archive includes an image of the country's first post-independence president, Leopold Senghor, and a shot of DaSilva shaking hands with jazz legend Velma Middleton.

Yet, DaSilva's photography career began in far from glamorous circumstances. Born in Benin, he served in the French army, where he photographed injured soldiers, burn victims and concentration camp survivors.

Following World War II, he settled in Dakar and later set up a studio in the city. DaSilva's son Luc, a curator, recalled its lively atmosphere.

""His studio was a place of gaiety for those who came to be immortalized in front of his camera. Affable, with a lot of humor and relaxing words to put everyone at ease, it was nice to be there,"" he said in an email interview, later adding: ""He was often surrounded by all sorts of artist friends and other intellectuals.""

Although well known in Senegal, DaSilva's international recognition is belated -- he never held an exhibition of his work during his lifetime. Luc has helped to preserve and promote his father's -- and Africa's -- photographic heritage through his organization Xaritufoto.

""One thing is certain: He was very present in the life of Dakar, going from one community to another frequenting all layers of the population, always being well accepted,"" Luc said of his father. ""And he knew the world. His education and elegance allowed him to be comfortable in all circumstances -- everywhere and with everyone.""

A selection of Roger DaSilva's photos is showing at the Also Known As Africa (AKAA) fair in Paris from Nov. 9-11, 2019. Proceeds from the archive will support the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation educational and medical work in Senegal.

Read more unknown and curious design origin stories here

Like many of history's greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally.

Alexey Pajitnov was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.

Little did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.

It was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.

The original version of Tetris.

Tetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called ""tetrominoes"" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.

To simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral ""tetra"" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.

Pajitnov himself was immediately hooked. ""I couldn't stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,"" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.

But creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.

Word of mouth

Although Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today's calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. ""It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,"" said Pajitnov.

Pajitnov wasn't making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.

Then, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.

""My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,"" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.

Stein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.

Eventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Game Boy

Tetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.

""I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,"" said Rogers in a phone interview. ""He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'""

Rogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. ""So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,"" he said.

Once in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.

""She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They're not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn't supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,"" he said.

But among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. ""Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,"" Rogers recalled. ""I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.""

The Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra ""easy to learn, hard to master.""

Delayed royalties

Despite the game's success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. ""There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,"" he said.

The legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo's favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline ""Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game."" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan ""From Russia with fun.""

Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. ""And they've been fine so far,"" he said.

Pajitnov and Rogers in 2018.

In 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames

Tetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as ""the Tetris Effect.""

To date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.

The latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game's 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called ""Tetris 99,"" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world's best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.

""It hasn't lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,"" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game's enduring popularity.

""It's like 'Happy Birthday.' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but 'Happy Birthday' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the 'Happy Birthday' of computer games."""
444,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/jackie-kennedy-inauguration-pillbox-hat-remember-when/index.html,Remember when Jackie Kennedy wore her famous pillbox hat?,"Written by Matthew Ponsford, CNN

Remember when Jackie Kennedy attended her husband's presidential inauguration with a perfect egg-shaped pillbox hat perched atop her head?

That's because it was meant to be unmissable.

Everything that happened on January 20, 1961, was stage-managed to tell America that a new age was dawning. John F. Kennedy was set to become the first US leader born in the 20th century, the first Catholic commander-in-chief and the first president whose inaugural speech was beamed across crackly television screens in color

""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,"" he implored a nation in need of reassurance and leadership at the height of the Cold War.

Not everything worked out as planned. Eight inches of snow fell on Washington overnight, winds lashed and, among all this, one accident would end up infiltrating American wardrobes.

Jackie's orb-like hat had been made to match a coat and fawn dress already created for her by her personal courtier Oleg Cassini. But it was also designed to look different: A cloth pillbox was exactly what everyone else would not be wearing.

In the freezing cold, many of the women sported stolid mink caps -- except Jackie, who stood out as the beacon of a new generation, characterized by clean lines and elegance. She appeared on the steps of the Capitol like ""the gorgeous petal in a dowdy bouquet of fur,"" according to Thurston Clarke, author of ""Ask Not,"" a book about the 1961 inauguration.

Jackie's distinctive headpiece was designed by Halston (real name Roy Halston Frowick). Later known as the creator of the free-flowing, slinky fashion of the 1970s disco era, Halston was then an up-and-coming New York milliner. He apparently spent hours sandwiched between two mirrors, shaping Jackie's hat into a perfect, simple dome.

Except, of course, it didn't end up like that.

Meet America's first superstar fashion designer

That morning, as she reached up to clasp the hat in high winds, Kennedy accidentally gave it a dimple -- a shallow indent, unnoticed but broadcast around the world. America swooned nonetheless. Kennedy's deification as the ultimate first lady of fashion had begun with a misshapen hat, its influence stretching to imitators from high society to the rural Midwest. Halston later laughed that ""everybody who copied it put a dent in it.""

Jackie's ensemble that day -- which she completed with a sable circlet and muff -- has become one of the most celebrated of presidential inauguration looks. But there's one thing we may have all been getting wrong: the color.

While most Americans will remember the first lady in duck-egg blue , complementing JFK's steel blue waistcoat and tie, color film footage from ""Halston,"" a CNN Films documentary about the legendary designer, shows her inauguration outfit appearing pinkish. And researchers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, where the outfit is stored, told CNN that the dress and hat were basically colorless -- a neutral, fawnish beige and not even slightly blue.

The origin of the mistake seems to be a color photograph from Life Magazine . But the cover of the same issue featured a very different photograph: Jackie in far less vivid tones, closer to the off-white captured by the handful of other press photographers present (early color film often struggled to match real hues).

So when, in 2017, Melania Trump wore a powder blue Ralph Lauren inauguration suit likened to Kennedy's, was it a tribute to an outfit that never existed?

Regardless of color, dimpled or not, the pillbox hat would become synonymous with Jackie's style as first lady. She wore one the day JFK was shot, twinned with a raspberry pink suit. The blood-covered suit is locked away in the National Archives, with instructions that it should hidden from public view until at least 2103 . The pink hat hasn't been seen since the fateful day she last wore it.

But the eulogizing of the first lady's ""looks"" risks relegating her to the role of a mere mannequin, when she in fact directed much of the new administration's aesthetic -- and not just when it came to fashion.

She may have spent fewer than three years in the White House, but during that time she brought in designers, including Stéphane Boudin, to modernize its interior. She also worked with legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy, the man behind the Lucky Strike cigarette packet and classic Studebaker cars, to choose the enduring powder blue of the US presidential plane, Air Force One.

JFK's inauguration marked the beginning of a new era of media-savvy presidents -- and he had his wife to thank for much of it."
445,,http://www.cnn.com/style/article/ancient-egypt-beauty-ritual-artsy/index.html,How ancient Egyptian cosmetics influenced our beauty rituals,"Written by Julia Wolkoff

This article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

The mysteries of the ancient Egyptians are vast, but their beauty tricks are no secret. Makeup might seem like a modern phenomenon -- one that has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry -- but cosmetics were equally important to daily life in the ancient world. From the earliest era of the Egyptian empire, men and women from all social classes liberally applied eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick and rouge.

The perceived seductiveness of Egyptian civilization has a lot to do with how we've glamorized its two most famous queens: Cleopatra and Nefertiti. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor defined the chic Egyptian look when she portrayed Cleopatra in the eponymous epic. In 2017, Rihanna (herself a makeup magnate) perfected it when she paid tribute to Nefertiti on the cover of Vogue Arabia. In their homages, both beauty icons wore saturated blue eyeshadow and thick, dark eyeliner.

Yet ancient Egyptians didn't only apply makeup to enhance their appearances -- cosmetics also had practical uses, ritual functions, or symbolic meanings. Still, they took their beauty routines seriously: The hieroglyphic term for makeup artist derives from the root ""sesh,"" which translates to write or engrave, suggesting that a lot of skill was required to apply ""kohl"" or lipstick (as anyone who has tried to emulate beauty tutorials on YouTube can attest).

The most refined beauty rituals were carried out at the toilettes of wealthy Egyptian women. A typical regimen for such a woman living during the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2030-1650 B.C.) would have been indulgent, indeed. Before applying any makeup, she would first prepare her skin.

She might exfoliate with Dead Sea salts or luxuriate in a milk bath -- milk-and-honey face masks were popular treatments. She could apply incense pellets to her underarms as deodorant, and floral- or spice-infused oils to soften her skin. Egyptians also invented a natural method of waxing with a mixture of honey and sugar. ""Sugaring,"" as it's called today, has been revived by beauty companies as a less painful alternative to hot wax.

After all this, a servant would bring in the many ingredients and tools necessary to create and apply her makeup. These apparatuses, containers and applicators were themselves lavish art objects that communicated social status. Calcite jars held makeup or unguents and perfumes and containers for eye paint and oils were crafted from expensive materials like glass, gold or semi-precious stones. Siltstone palettes used to crush materials for kohl and eyeshadow were carved to resemble animals, goddesses or young women.

These symbols represented rebirth and regeneration, and the act of grinding pigments on an animal palette was thought to grant the wearer special capabilities by overcoming the creature's power. (Members of the lower classes used more modest tools when applying their own makeup.)

The servant would create eyeshadow by mixing powdered malachite with animal fat or vegetable oils. While the lady sat at her toilette, before a polished bronze ""mirror,"" the servant would use a long ivory stick -- perhaps carved with an image of the goddess Hathor -- to sweep on the rich green pigment. Just as women do today, eyeshadow would be followed with a thick line of black kohl around her eyes.

This part of the routine had practical purposes beyond beautifying the wearer. Kohl was used by both sexes and all social classes to protect the eyes from the intense glare of the desert sun. The Egyptian word for ""makeup palette"" derives from their word meaning ""to protect,"" a reference to its defensive abilities against the harsh sunlight or the ""evil eye."" Additionally, the toxic, lead-based mineral that it was made from had antibacterial properties when combined with moisture from the eyes.

The final touches to this lady's makeup would, of course, be red lipstick -- a classic look even today. To make the paint, ochre was typically blended with animal fat or vegetable oil, though Cleopatra was known to crush beetles for her perfect shade of red. These highly toxic concoctions, often mixed with dyes extracted from iodine and bromine mannite, could lead to serious illness, or sometimes death -- possibly where the phrase ""kiss of death"" derives from.

In death, too, personal appearance was crucial to Egyptian identity. Burial sites uncovered from the very beginning of the society's history, in pre-dynastic times, show that it was common for Egyptians to include everyday items like combs, scented ointments, jewelry and cosmetics in the graves of men, women and children (many graves have been found with makeup still inside them).

We might closely associate the Egyptians with their dramatic beauty looks largely because of their prolific use on mummies and death masks. Instead of depicting their subjects' real features, these cartonnage masks and wooden coffins portray idealized youths with smooth skin and kohl-rimmed eyes.

In fact, mummification itself followed many of the daily self-care rituals Egyptians followed while alive. Unguents for softening the skin took on religious significance when they were used to anoint the body, and even cosmetics were sometimes applied.

The singular Egyptian aesthetic -- from architecture to art to makeup -- has captured the modern imagination for its elegance, exoticism and style. Yet the ancient kingdom's influence on our beauty ideals is more direct through its inventions, down to the eyeliner and lipstick we still love to wear."
