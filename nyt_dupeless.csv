Today: We hear from supporters of the president and the president-elect.

Tonight, we’re seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith in tomorrow, bring a better day.

On Saturday night, I went out in Atlanta, where hundreds of people were gathered in the streets, looking at their cell phones and nearby TV screens set up at sidewalk bars.

But while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last. [CHEERING]

And what a testament it is to Joe’s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president. [CHEERING]

So I spent the night walking around, talking to people about how they were feeling.

And while it was Pennsylvania that delivered the Democrats the Electoral College votes they needed to get across the finish line, the polls in Georgia were showing that it’s looking increasingly likely that the state will flip blue for the first time since 1992. [CHEERING]

You know, there’s something fishy going on here. And I think the other side has resorted to shenanigans to sway the vote.

I don’t think it would have been this way if every vote had not been counted. At the end of the day, we would still be red.

Listen, I really — we have to give a big shout out to Stacey Abrams, because I really feel like she is a big part of what changed in Georgia, getting out there. She may have lost to the governor, but she was like, never again. And she came out. She made sure that people were voting, people who felt like they didn’t get a chance. She just was hitting those streets, and I really feel like that made a big part in Georgia flipping. I’m so happy about it. I can’t believe it.

I mean, I kept thinking, could this reverse? Could it go back? So I actually watched it closely because of that. We’ve had the TV on since Tuesday.

As the numbers kept coming in, and it got more and more of a lead, what did that feel like?

Yes. So I feel like it’s a miracle. It feels like a true miracle in Georgia, that we are blue. I just can’t even believe it.

Just in general to say that we live in Georgia that has turned from red to blue, we turned blue, baby. So that’s the only thing that matters. We turned blue!

Things being reversed, a lot of stuff. So it just changed — it changed a lot. For me, it was less happy and more relief.

I mean, being a black man, I mean, you’re always worried. Every time he leaves the house, you’re always worried. And I’m not saying that’s completely gone, but it just gives me a sigh of relief, like we can just breathe a little bit. But this just means we get to finally be in a world where we can see some change.

This means I get to marry her and not fear that we couldn’t get married in our state. This means we can have kids. I don’t have to fear for my dad’s life as much as I used to.

Yeah, I just feel like everybody — the weight is lifted. I feel like everybody feels like — just hope. We’re a gay couple, and so it just — how do you feel?

I heard Vice President-elect Harris talk about — she had a very inclusive message. What does that mean to be standing in such a diverse community and hear that message come from someone about to take an office in the White House?

Honestly, it just means that the possibilities like President-elect Biden said, they’re endless. So now that we have an African-American woman as the vice president, the door is open. We’re just gonna walk in!

I called my mom and my stepmom, which are both around the same age. And they’re just so ecstatic. And my stepmom specifically said, “I’m so relieved for my people.”

It definitely makes a difference for younger people. But I talk to people like my mom, that’s in her 60s, and they’re just as emotional about it. Because it’s they didn’t think they would see.

And that’s exactly how I feel tonight. I just got overwhelmed. The tears just started flowing, and I just feel like it happened in my lifetime. I told my niece before I got here, baby, “Because she is, you can.” And I told her to repeat that to me. And I think [CRYING], and I just want her to know that she can, because she did. I think that’s the most important part for me — the next generation. That’s what it means to me. My niece can see that in her lifetime.

I took my little niece to the polls with me, and she was so excited, but to actually see it come to life, and she’s like, “Auntie, I helped you vote. I helped make that happen.” So today when we won, she was like, “I can’t believe it, auntie.” And I said, “Baby, you can do anything you want to do.”

I have little cousins, little black girls, and they can look up to her and realize that they can be vice president. They can be president. They can be whatever they want to be.

I’m sure so many little black girls out there are so emotional about this.

Just being a black woman and seeing Kamala be the first black vice president female, it just feels really good.

You can’t really explain how it feels to be a black woman and feel like you can finally see yourself in politics. Like, you see so many young women in Kamala.

I got emotional about it. For me, that’s amazing. Not only the first woman, but it’s a black woman. And a woman of color.

On Friday night, before the election was called for Biden, I went downtown to the Philadelphia Convention Center, where poll workers were counting, trying to figure out which candidate had won the state. All day long, there’d been these unsubstantiated rumors on social media, claiming that the people inside were altering and destroying Trump ballots and not letting observers stand at a reasonable distance. So some protesters had shown up, including this small woman with long hair named Lauren. She was a Trump supporter who drove all the way from her home in New Jersey, because she said she had to do something.

You know what I mean? And if there’s something criminal going on, especially here, where the Declaration of Independence was signed, we all deserve to know. We all deserve to know what’s going on. And if there is a cover-up happening, shame, shame.

Lauren had traveled so far, because the idea that the poll workers inside were stealing the election was horrifying to her. But maybe just as bad in her mind was the fact that outside, there were hundreds of people celebrating that injustice. Some local Democratic groups had decided to put on a dance party after Biden pulled ahead, so all around us there were people swaying and laughing. And to Lauren, it felt like they were literally dancing in the streets as her rights were being taken from her.

The fact that people are seeming to be not concerned at all with the possibility that malfeasance has occurred is what makes me sad. I mean, I’m just seeing a real lack of critical thinking in so many people. I just want fairness, and I want to know get my vote counted.

Lauren said that since Covid, her life had really nosedived. She’d lost her small business when the Democratic governor of New Jersey ordered a Covid lockdown, and her kids were also having a hard time.

What do I tell my daughter? She didn’t have her first day of high school. She didn’t have her eight grade formal. I don’t know what we’re going to do as a community to heal. I don’t know how we’re ever going to heal from this. I don’t. America [EXPLETIVE] sucks really [EXPLETIVE] bad. I want my life back, and it’s just being stolen. It’s stolen. You know what? I don’t even —

My kids, what is there for them now? My daughter was very socially active in her school and very involved in extracurricular activities, that she literally has no zest or desire to do anymore. These kids are sitting in their houses, in their bedrooms, doing nothing. I mean, she tells my husband that she doesn’t even want to go to college, and I’m OK with that. Because you know what? I’m in [EXPLETIVE] debt. I have student debt, hundreds of thousands of dollars, OK?

The morning after Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election by every major news organization, I called Lauren back to see how she was doing. And she sounded as bleak as the night I first met her.

I feel this declaration is really a dangerous, reckless act on the part of media. What’s going to happen if this goes the other way? I feel like it was just so irresponsible for any public figure to come out and take a position on who the president-elect is. This is in no way over. Not even close. I mean, there’s a Supreme Court case.

That was the one bright spot for Lauren. She felt like history was on her side.

I mean, I know that it’s probably going to be a slow drip of information. And I know that there’s going to be a lot of rhetoric that tries to downplay and delegitimize an effort to have an election that has integrity. I mean, listen, all of us need to be concerned about what’s happening right now. Is there’s fraud, don’t you want to know about it? Or is it OK that there’s fraud as long as it’s not your candidate that’s getting pushed out unjustly?

I mean, I lived through the Gore-Bush episode, too. So I realize that sometimes these things are — I realize that people jump the gun. And so 37 — what was it, 37, 38 days that Al Gore actually thought he was president, and then had to concede?

Lauren said it was also discouraging. She couldn’t bring herself to listen to Biden’s victory speech the night before.

Well, Lauren, thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it.

Anger, sadness, depression, anxiety, a little bit of fear, concern. I’m just eager. I’m really hoping that our justice system has an intact set of values and principles that our founding fathers envisioned for this nation. And that’s really the best that I can hope for. And it’s just integrity, constitutional integrity.

I’m Astead Herndon in Mason County, Texas. Mason County is about two hours outside of Austin. It’s very rural, only about 5,000 people. And about 75 percent of its residents are white.

And on Sunday, I showed up to a parking lot at a church here, hoping to talk with people about the election.

Well, praise the Lord, the way that people got out and voted this year. Praise the Lord for that. To exercise that freedom. Whatever side anybody’s on, it doesn’t matter. What a joy to see people —

And we’re in Mason County today partly because the county had the biggest increase in voters out of any county in Texas in this presidential election. And I’m just talking to people about —

And so I wanted to know if that message resonates in a place like this. Are people here open to Biden’s appeals for unity?

I came to Mason County because the early data tells us it had the highest increase in voter turnout in the entire state of Texas during this presidential election. And it went overwhelmingly for President Trump, by about 78 percent. It’s places like this that President-elect Joe Biden is now trying to reach out and say, “I know you didn’t vote for me, but I’ll be a president for all Americans. I’ll be a president for you.” He’s asking for these Trump supporters to give him a chance.

He impressed me in one speech he made after the election by talking about the Ecclesiastes scripture, there is a time for all things, and this is a time for healing.

Some people, like Anne Momkin, a lifelong conservative who actually voted for Biden this year, did seem open to it.

And I feel like now that it’s over with, and I know who’s gotten the most votes probably, this has been such a conflicted election. I feel kind of a sense of relief. And I feel like I’m going to be hopeful, because I feel like if the Democrats are the administration in power, they can address the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter situation in a way that maybe we weren’t as Republicans addressing. So maybe that scripture, there’s a season for all things, maybe the season of change a little bit will help in addressing things that haven’t been addressed. And I just — I like that he’s a man of faith. I really like that. And when he said last night on the stage that one of his favorite hymns was On Eagle’s Wings, I’m sorry, those things appeal to me. And I like his wife.

But for others in town, it was hard to imagine Biden breaking through any time soon.

astead herndon

I’m walking up to this house. This is quite possibly the most Texas street ever. We see some Trump signs. We see some more Trump signs. Hey, how are you all?

speaker

[INAUDIBLE].

astead herndon

These are some of the folks we met at the church earlier. They have a big Trump-Pence sign at their front door, and they’re sitting outside on their porch. Hi.

woman

Hello.

astead herndon

Thank you all. How are you?

woman

Air bump or fist bump, whatever —

astead herndon

Fist bump is fine by me. My name is Astead.

man

Astead, have a seat.

astead herndon

Thank you. How long have you all been in Mason County?

woman

Life.

astead herndon

Your life?

man

Born and raised. We were high school sweethearts. We’ve been married 40 — it was 47 years. We’re going on — this coming December 9 will be —

woman

48.

man

Will be 48 years.

astead herndon

How old are you?

man

I’m 69 years old.

astead herndon

You’re 69. How old are you?

woman

I don’t remember.

man

She’s 67.

woman

67.

man

Tomorrow, she’ll be 67.

astead herndon

Well, happy birthday, happy birthday. Hey, look at that. So we’re here in Mason today partly because the county was one of the ones that had the highest increase in voting, out of any county in the state.

woman

Really? How wonderful.

astead herndon

Yeah, and so one of the things we’re talking about is how folks are feeling, how they’ve looked at the presidential race, and just where they see the country going right now.

woman

Well, you can see I’m a Trump person.

astead herndon

No, I see. I see. You’ve got the Trump sign right there, there’s no —

woman

It fell off and I had to — so anyway, it’s not a —

man

You know, I’m not going to complain about Biden or nothing. I don’t like a lot of the things that he stands for and that, but if he makes it president, I have no problem. But be fair about it. I don’t want to see any cheating to get somebody in there. And I think there’s some of that going on, and different things and that. And that’s my point of view.

astead herndon

If I can ask, at this point, do you feel like Biden is the president-elect, or do you still think we got a longer time to go?

man

I think we’ve still got a long time to go. I don’t think all the votes are counted right. Until they get that counted right, then I mean — if Biden gets it, I have no problem. That’s my president then. That’s what I’m claiming. I’m not gonna be like these Democrats that just throwed a fit about Trump being in there for the last four years. And they — I don’t think the Democrats have stood behind him and helped, helped him get through what he’s done. He’s done a lot, in my point of view.

woman

What he’s done in the face of a hoax, in the face of impeachment. My eyes is on Christ. My eyes is on the Lord. And he’s the one who says whether or not we would submit to the presidency of Biden. We may not agree with a lot of it, and I think he is a — what do they call that, the Trojan horse that comes in? And the liberalism and the far left? That’s not good for our country. This country is founded on freedom. I see that, but socialism I don’t agree with.

astead herndon

Biden says that, you know, I beat Bernie Sanders. I’m not a socialist. He said yesterday during his speech how even people who didn’t vote for him, people like you all, that he’ll be a president for you, that he’ll listen to you, that he wants to bring people together. When you hear that, what do you think?

woman

I don’t believe it. I’m sorry. When they fought tooth and nail, resisted, obstructed, all the things that the Democratic Party and Biden have done, it’s not right. And now they want healing? “Oh, yeah, let’s all come together.” You have not earned it. If the American people voted for him, yes, it will hand over, and that’ll be fine. Do not tell me that I need to follow someone who cheats to get that.

astead herndon

What do you — what are you most fearful of and what are you most hopeful for going forward?

woman

[LAUGHTER] I was hopeful that Trump would get his votes right and be reelected. And most fearful of is that the corruption, the bias could take hold. I don’t want that.

man

I’m gonna say the most hopeful is that if either side had cheated to win this election — it could be either side, I don’t care which side you want to put it on — if either side did, I hope they get caught. And I hope that they get — they’ve served the time that they need to serve from doing it. I hope that they catch ‘em, and I hope they hang ‘em.

song

— for waking me up this morning. That’s why I praise you. For sending me on my way.

telley lynette gadson

Well, my sisters and brothers, this is Sunday number 34, and the Covid-19 season and the year 2020, the year that pastors became producers all over the world. What a blessing it is to share together this morning in this virtual worship experience. I praise God this morning to bring you greetings from the back patio of the parsonage of the 9-1-1 in Greer, South Carolina. I am Reverend Telley Lynette Gadson, and that’s a lot to say. So affectionately I am known as Pastor T.

song

And for this I give you praise.

telley lynette gadson

Let me share with you that I’ve taken a break from being on vacation over these last few weeks for this special Facebook Live sermonic experience. Why, Pastor T? In celebration, honor and respect of the history we have witnessed this week with the elections of a man named Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. from Scranton, PA, and a woman named Kamala Devi Harris from Oakland, CA, respectively to the highest offices in the land of these United States of America, with the voices of the vote, my sisters and brothers. The people are singing a new song this morning. The Bible says, “O sing a new song unto the Lord.” We’re singing a new song of life and new hope with the blessed assurance of new leadership.

song

— for every mountain. You brought me over! You safely brought me over. For every triumph! For every triumph!

telley lynette gadson

The blessed Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings like eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. I want to say to President-elect Joe Biden, 78 gonna look great on you, sir. I see your mojo is still working. I believe that there is a woman named Kamala Harris that will declare to us good black, it just don’t crack. And it doesn’t matter when they count you out, because they can’t count. #counteveryblessing. Name them one by one. I believe I can hear from the balcony of heaven. Don’t let anybody steal your possibility. I hear Martin say, “King me.” Sojourner say, “Tell the truth.” Barbara say, “Cross join.” I heard Barack say, “Yes, we can.” I heard Michelle say, “When they go low, we go high.” Is there anybody here that heard Kamala say, “Excuse me, but I am speaking.” And to paraphrase, let the redeemed of the Lord say so. If you’re blessed this morning, you ought to drop some hearts and let the world know that I am blessed from the crown of my head to the soul of my feet. I am blessed, and I won’t let anybody steal my possibility. I’ve got to count to every blessing.

kara swisher

In “Sway,” I examine power. Who’s got it, and how it works. Esther Perel’s power is the quiet kind. She may be the world’s most famous couples counselor, and her work has influenced millions of people. I certainly know it’s influenced me. In Perel’s podcasts, “Where Should We Begin?” and “How’s Work,” people spill their deepest, darkest secrets.

archived recording And I can’t get enough of an erection. Is it fair to say you’re a little jealous of Jean-Claude? They made a crack about me not being their real father. archived recording (esther perel) Who is “they?” archived recording My children.

kara swisher

I’m not going to give her any secrets here. In fact, I don’t really have any good secrets. But I am going to seek her advice in this crazy and exciting time. [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, I just got married last month. I got married again for the second time, which I always call a triumph of hope over experience. No, I actually had a very good relationship previously, too. Any relationship advice for me? I’ve been married a month, so anything I need to keep in mind?

esther perel

And you have a baby.

kara swisher

I have a baby. We did that before the marriage, yes, exactly.

esther perel

And how old is your baby?

kara swisher

A year and a month, essentially. We married the day after her first birthday. And she’s amazing.

esther perel

Wonderful.

kara swisher

Of the no boons of the pandemic, having the baby around has been one that’s been a joy. So any advice for me, in a month? I think I’m doing OK. I think I’m doing good.

esther perel

Well, I just thought of two questions that I think you could have fun with. One is for both of you, for that matter. Knowing yourself, as well as you do know yourself, what would you say is one thing that makes it hard to live with you?

kara swisher

Oh God. That’s a really good question. I can be impatient. I like to do everything quickly. I’m a very candid person. So even around logistics, or everything else. So I think I move a little faster. And I think I’m probably too fast-moving for most people. That’s what I would say.

esther perel

OK. So you can spend a little time, the two of you, and this goes on. So when I’m impatient, it manifests in this way. And this is what effect it has in our relationship. And it may very well be that she was attracted to me, in part, because I’m quick on the go, resolute, action-oriented. And that I have an attraction to the fact that she can be more contemplative or reflective and less reactive, and all of that. So then, from there, you explore the complementarity. So that’s one question. And then the other one would be, what’s a vulnerability? I can ask it about you and I can ask it about her. What’s a vulnerability that you grapple with?

kara swisher

Oh, I don’t have a lot.

esther perel

But let me put it inuit her. What’s a vulnerability that you would say she grapples with?

kara swisher

Well, I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of them. I think she probably would say her career. Because she is focused on the baby now, which I think is wonderful and just as laudable.

esther perel

Of course. And then I would say, because one is a question about self-awareness, the other one is a question about empathic awareness. So the second one then becomes, and how do you relate to that question of hers? And you just said, I actually totally support her, I don’t look down on her, I think that’s not laudable. And how does she respond to your support? I think that those are two questions that every relationship can ask itself one month into marriage or not. If you want to change the other, change yourself. That would be another one.

kara swisher

Oh Wow, that’s a big one. It’s interesting, because at the beginning of the pandemic, she was sort of doom scrolling every terrible thing. And I’m like, let’s just go. Let’s just move on, we can’t get stuck into this. But now, with this election, the doom scrolling continues. And I’m like, It’ll work, it’ll work. No, don’t worry about a thing.

esther perel

I think that any crisis will sharpen the differences in people’s coping style. And one of the differences is that one person may want to charge ahead and do things and fix things, and try to control destiny in some way. And the other person wants to gather all the information and be really clear as to what is the course of action we should take. One person becomes highly practical.

kara swisher

Yeah, except in the morning when I wake up and doom scroll, like, guess what happened last night. I’m like, no, I don’t want to know. Just, for an hour, I would like —

esther perel

Coffee first. [LAUGHS]

kara swisher

Or anything first. Sometimes I just don’t want to know because it goes away. Everybody needs to have a lot of details because they think, in details there is some salvation, I guess. And I don’t think there is.

esther perel

Actually, the research does not necessarily support that. There is this notion that there is overexposure. And that, actually, you need to really know how much to limit your media intake, your news intake. Or you basically start to disregulate, you become really stressed out. And then that becomes the next issue. Now you can start reading about stress.

kara swisher

Right, right, exactly. So that’s why I don’t like doom scrolling. So marriage expert Stephanie Coontz wrote an essay suggesting gay marriages are happier than heterosexual ones. Do you buy that?

esther perel

Yes.

kara swisher

Why is that?

esther perel

I don’t know if I would say by definition happier. But, here’s the thing. You have the pros and the cons of not having to live in the midst of pre-existing structures, narrative scripts of life, institutions. On the one hand, you lack it. Therefore, legally, you are more vulnerable. You were before anyway, for sure. But interpersonally, you get to be much more creative. You get to create families of choice. It’s much more fluid. It’s much less institutional and legacy, history, passing on one way of doing heterosexual marriage. And I think when gay couples are able to tap into that, there is much more energy.

kara swisher

Yeah, and also the movies.

esther perel

This is long known.

kara swisher

But the expectations thing is, when a lot of my friends see those movies, there’s all this imagery that they seem imprisoned by in a lot of ways.

esther perel

I would say all couples who are able to not be constrained by pre-existing ideas of how it should be, which gay couples have less of it. Because nobody actually addressed them before as couples.

kara swisher

Same thing with parenting, too, which is interesting. I have two teenage children and we just had the baby. But everyone’s like, which one’s the dad. Straight people constantly are like, which one’s the dad. And I’m like, no one. Or everyone.

esther perel

I think the distinction that you highlighted before is much more salient. You have a front line parent. Which is your wife, who is, at this point more dedicated to the daughter. And her sense of time, her boundaries, her needs are much more permeated with the needs of the baby. And you are, in that sense able to maintain much more of a sense of separateness. You are at work, you’re doing your thing. That line between the front line parent and the other parent, between the parent who thinks about the needs of the child and the parents who thinks about the needs of the couple.

kara swisher

That’s true.

esther perel

Those complementarities, I think, are much more functional. They are sometimes gender-based in straight marriages. But I think that it narrows us to think about it, actually, only in gender terms.

kara swisher

Yes. 100%. Let’s talk about that idea of power, then. You’ve called sex the oldest power exchange system. What role does power play in a romantic or sexual relationship?

esther perel

Look, there is no relationship without power. The ingredient power appears the moment I need you. You have power over your baby. But if your baby decides not to sleep the whole night and cry, she has power over you. Ask anyone with a two-year-old. Power is not always vertical and coming from the top down. So power is something that you have to. Power to do things, it’s a generative power. And power over, that you have over somebody else. And it is a very intricate thing. The moment I depend on you in, some way, you have power over me. And I decide, and we decide in the relationship how we manage it. So it starts from the beginning. It starts from the beginning. It’s part of the basic ingredients of what goes into a relationship. The same way that we say trust starts the moment you begin to develop a relationship, so does the existence of power. Around, sexuality one power is the power to coerce. The other is the power to systematically refuse. The other is the power to oblige. To just make you feel like, get it done, get it over with. To demean, to trivialize, to humiliate. All of these have power in them.

kara swisher

Right. Is it typical that one person has power in a relationship, or it just depends on what moment?

esther perel

I think that some relationships are very clearly positioned with one person having more power than the other. But we need to say about what. It’s decision making. It’s the money-earning, it’s owns the children, has appropriated the children, gets to define the story of the relationship. What is the power we’re talking about? It changes. It’s extreme. When people say a power dynamic, they think of a structure. In fact, they should be thinking about something that is highly dynamic. It shifts all the time.

kara swisher

Yeah. So one of the things a lot of your work, like your book, “The State of Affairs,” focuses on is infidelity, which is another power exchange. You said people who cheat on their partners are exercising freedom and the power of transgression. What did you mean by that?

esther perel

Adultery is a taboo. Weaker than it was in some circles, but it is still majorly a taboo. Therefore, when you do the forbidden, you experience a sense of freedom and power. The power of agency, the power of doing what I want, which is sometimes even reinforced when I know that I do what I’m not supposed to. And so it empowers. In that sense, it becomes an act of freedom, an act of reclamation, sometimes agency, sometimes liberation. Sometimes just simple selfishness. It’s all of that. That’s on the part of the person who does it. On the part of the receiving person, the experience of the violation of trust, the betrayal, shatters all their assumptions about a shared reality. I thought we were in this together, I thought you had my back, I thought you would never do something like that to hurt me. It is painful beyond. So what it means for one person is very different from what it does to the other person. And that’s why the experience of infidelity in a relationship is so polarizing. A little bit like what’s happening in the nation at this moment.

kara swisher

A perfect transition. A little bit like what’s happening to our nation. The toxicity to our country, it feels like a bad marriage.

esther perel

I often think that couples therapists have a certain experience with polarized . Relationships We sit very often with two people who have no shared well affects. You wonder if what they’re talking about happened in the same relationship. They systematically think that they are a rainbow with many nuances and their partner is all in black and white. They think that when they do certain things that are not nice, then it’s circumstantial. And when their partner does mean things, it’s characterological. And they have very little ability to not experience the other person’s point of view as a threat. In that sense, there are quite a lot of similarities with what’s happening on a national level. We have actually shifted at this moment. Anand Giridharadas said a beautiful sentence, “We are a nation that is no longer just in disagreement, we have disgust.” And in intimate relationships, contempt is the killer. That’s the one that tops all of them. And this disgust that we have right now, there is a sense that the other people are fundamentally different creatures. What planet do they live on?

kara swisher

So what do you do with that? How do you move on from that when it feels so personal and emotional, and you’re disgusted with people.

esther perel

That is why, I think, that I look at this group of parents in the Middle East. In Israeli and Palestinian parents, I just saw people who came together on the basis of their raw grief on loss. Not on the politics. That’s one thing they shared. They could, of course, say, it was your terrorist attack, it was your destruction of my house. But they managed to first meet as mothers who lost their beloved child, as fathers who lost. And I think that since the one thing that we all have in common at this moment here is stress, acute stress and prolonged uncertainty and anticipatory grief, that’s where I would start. You meet people and you don’t start talking about their ideas. Their ideas are often fueled by their fears, by their longings, by their scarcity, by their hopes. And then we applied to the American situation.

kara swisher

That’s interesting. Because I have a family of many Trumpers. And it’s really hard to speak to them. I have to say. They never shut up. I actually talk less than they do about their grievances. And I have particular problems, for example, with my mom. And it’s constantly, because she’s on Fox News. And we had a big argument over Covid because she kept going out. But just recently, it got even worse, because I did this interview with Hillary Clinton. And she hadn’t heard my interview, but she was getting it filtered through Fox News, and whatever the heck else she looks at. I guess Breitbart, or whatever. And she misrepresented my own reporting to me in order to attack Joe Biden. Which I’m like, it’s just my choice for president. And it was like I didn’t quite know what to do, except I just stopped talking. I was like, I’m just not going to talk anymore. Until this election’s over, I cannot speak to you.

esther perel

I’m going to try this from a different angle. What I would say is you’re arguing with your mother over content. The form always precedes the content. This is extremely important for understanding these impasses in relationships. So you go to your mom and you say, you know mom, I know you to be someone who usually cares a lot about, people pays attention to people. You have a big heart. And you go from that place. And you say, it was very upsetting to me today because I’ve come to know you differently. And if she continues with content, you repeat it again. You just stay with the process. Because we are Homo Sapiens, we really think that you resolve something by digging further into the topic. When in fact, if we were animals we would just be doing faces right now, and sounds. And when you see that the sounds don’t make sense and don’t accomplish anything, you have got to go around to their feelings, to the emotional connection that you have with her. I know that it would devastate you if any of us were ever sick. I know that you are that kind of a mother.

kara swisher

Maybe.

esther perel

It doesn’t matter if it’s true. That’s probably who she wants to be. It’s how she wants to be seen. Talk to the person, not from their lowest part. Talk to her from her aspiration.

kara swisher

But I’ll have to tell you, a lot of people who have this problem with Trump supporters in their family, for example, they literally just don’t talk. Not talking sometimes feels better. No communication. I know that sounds crazy, and the pandemic makes it easy.

esther perel

Thanksgiving is coming up. So people will be with their families. And I don’t think that when people don’t resolve a political difference or an ideological difference that that’s what it’s about. What it’s about is that one person feels disrespected by the other, betrayed by the other. It’s these kind of things that create the breach, not the ideas themselves.

kara swisher

So you’re essentially saying one person has to be the bigger person and move in and solve it.

esther perel

You don’t solve. You don’t solve, you just maintain a connection. You just say there are certain things we absolutely do not talk about or don’t agree on. When we start, we have a screaming match. But we have a foundation underneath us, that if anything happens between us, there is a love, there is a trust, there is a reliance, there is a dependability. And those things are holding us together. A friend of mine was telling me how in her family, her grandfather was a leader in the Ku Klux Klan. Her aunties are white supremacists. And her mother passed away. And her aunties, her aunts, are her connection to her mother. She wants a connection to her mother and she disagrees fundamentally with the world view of these aunts. And how would she straddle that? And everybody internally, if you can tap into old memories, if you can still have a connection to the mother, if there is something a motivation to remain with these people, then you do what you call “the bridge.” You don’t bridge your values. You don’t bridge your ideology. You don’t. And you sometimes live and you say, in my family there are people, who if ever I was not their family member and something was to happen to me, they would not come to help me. And that is a very hard truth to live with. And some people will manage to live with the ambivalence about that person and still stay connected. And some will say, I get sick from this and I don’t want to be with these people.

kara swisher

So there’s some relationships not worth bridging or saving.

esther perel

Of course. It’s not that they’re not worth it, you don’t have the motivation. Even on the racist front. I tried to look, for me, about situations that help me not get completely ensnared in a place from which there is no exit. So as a child of Holocaust survivors, one of the things I remember often hearing about is the people who were hiding the Jewish children. They could be virulently anti-Semitic. But if a hungry kid stood at the door of the farmer, which was usually the woman, she was often likely to give him or her a piece of bread. Or even hide them in their attic for months on end. Because the religious value, the Christian value of charity and seeing a hungry child superseded the other ideology. I think in moments of choice, some people are completely linear and will act exactly according to their racist ideology. And some people have a mix of things. And on an individual level they may act differently than on an ideological level.

kara swisher

Right, because they’re appealing to those particular characteristics.

esther perel

Because we have other values inside of us too.

kara swisher

They’re warring with each other.

esther perel

Right, it helps me to think like this. It does it doesn’t apply to everybody, but I think that it helps me maintain the sense that it’s not black and white. Because then we have no conversation to be had.

kara swisher

Well speaking of no conversation to be had, I’m going to move you to politics. Dysfunctional relationships. Congress. Nancy Pelosi, when I interviewed her, talked about having not talked to Trump for a year. Obviously, she and Mitch McConnell have to get along. What tips do you give to Republicans and Democrats who have burned bridges with each other?

esther perel

I mean, I think, Nancy Pelosi is completely off.

kara swisher

Because?

esther perel

Because I think that he relishes her anger. He relishes it.

kara swisher

So she should, like, hug him.

esther perel

Yes. Look, I think that what I’m going to say is good because I can put weight behind what I say for relationships. On a political frame, it could sound naive, what I’m going to say. But one piece that travels with me is, sometimes it is more important to be wise than to be right. You don’t have to make your point. Everybody knows what you think. So ask yourself, does this serve me? If you don’t talk to somebody, does this serve you? Or do you actually think you would get more by maintaining a communication? Or are there other people that you can put in place to continue the communication, because you want to play the part of the angry one who doesn’t bend? But you have other people who do stay in touch. Because if you have no connection to the people that you need to ultimately work something out with, then you won’t work anything out. And that’s why we’ve had paralysis, paralysis, paralysis. One paralysis was, I can’t move until you agree with me. And there are other paralysis, I can’t move because I need you to join me on some level. And if you don’t join me, I can’t do anything. So this is what we’ve had. The goal here is to find out, how do you get things done? My fear is, really, that.

kara swisher

So how do you? You’re the therapist, how do you? What would you do?

esther perel

I would just say, they obviously care about this as very much. They wouldn’t be digging their heels If they didn’t care. It’s a re-frame. I think what I get into is big re-frames that prevent me from being completely stuck. My thinking when I look at a system like that is, what do I do with a stuck system? It’s like crust in a pan. You just want to have it first move a tiny bit to create movement. And that generally goes from humor, to ingratiating, to taking the other person by surprise and doing the opposite of what they expect you to do. They expect you to be angry and to shout at them you actually basically go and you say how are you today. We call it discontinuity. You take them by surprise. Because the more you do what they expect you to do, the more they will respond the way that you’ve expected them to respond. And off we go. So it’s these small micro-movements that you do when you want to take a stuck system and bring it to life, give it possibilities. I don’t know if that works on a larger scale. I am not an expert on that. And so I’m going to stick to what I know.

kara swisher

So let’s talk a little bit about Trump himself. How do we move on from him? He is like a bad boyfriend. He occupies our social minds, our political minds, our cultural minds. Is it an addiction in a lot of ways?

esther perel

No. Trumpism is going to stay. National populism from the right is on the rise all over the world. This is the American version of it. And he embodies that. This is not a bad boyfriend that you pass over at all. He’s not going anywhere. He represents and has cultivated and has been shaped by that anti-institutional aspiration in which he is the master. He is utterly brilliant.

kara swisher

Transgressions, transgressions.

esther perel

Not of transgression, of delusion. This is grandiosity.

kara swisher

So what does that work and why the addiction to him? Because I think everybody, on both sides, has an addiction to this personality. Why can nobody look away?

esther perel

Because malignant narcissism has tremendous power over people in that sense. It has the power when it is charming. It has the power when it is vindictive. It has the power when it is vengeful and punitive. It has the power when it creates delusions. It has the power because it makes you see what you would like to see, even if that’s not what is there. It has the power because it says, trust me I’ve got it in my hands. Leave it up to me, I’ll make it happen for you. It is seductive on so many levels. Not just in America.

kara swisher

We’ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview want to hear more, hit subscribe. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you’ve missed, like my conversation with sci-fi novelist Jeff VanderMeer. And you’ll also get new ones delivered to you. More with Esther Perel after the break. So I want to finish up talking about the pandemic. So you wrote this book in 2006 called “Mating in Captivity,” which I think is very resonant today. The title has taken on a new meaning in the quarantine. And you’ve called the pandemic a Petri dish moment for relationships. How is the experiment going?

esther perel

Right now it’s like swimming through molasses.

kara swisher

Yeah exactly, the petri dish is bigger than that.

esther perel

Look, I would say it like this. Pandemics, disasters, are relationship accelerators. You become aware of mortality. You say, I live once. Life is short. What am I waiting for? And what am I waiting for can be, let’s have babies, let’s get married. Otherwise, what am I waiting for can be I’m out of here. So I think, in general, when we are facing this existential reality, we rearrange our priorities. So that’s one thing that is happening in many, many people’s lives. What matters to us truly at this moment and let’s throw the rest overboard a little bit. The next thing is, some people have been really dealing with the suffocation of 24/7. Some people have really enjoyed coming together as families like they hadn’t in a long time. Some people are so appreciative of the fact that they haven’t had to fly all the time.

kara swisher

I have to say I’m the latter. I’ve been enjoying time with my kids.

esther perel

You have?

kara swisher

Yeah, and my partner. Yeah, it’s been great, actually.

esther perel

So that’s one story we hear a lot, is people really feel that they’ve had time to slow down to connect with their kids and all of that. Other people have dealt with the excruciating choices of where to put their grandparents, how not to let the grandparents come and see the grandchildren. Dealing with illness, dealing with death, dealing with loneliness, dealing with not seeing their family that is living abroad. People are struggling with the too much and the too little. People are struggling with redefining our relationship to space. We are avoiding the stranger like never before. Everything that is happenstance, chance encounter, curiosity. The erotic side of life has been cut off from us. That is very challenging to people. Many people are touch-starved. That’s happening to many of us.

kara swisher

And then I’d love to get back to, in this pandemic, not only do we have our partners, we have them around all the time. What happens to sex drive and intimacy?

esther perel

I think that it’s well known that stress can go in both directions when it comes to sex. But most of the time it goes in the direction of shutting you down. I was talking yesterday with Justin Garcia who is the head of the Kinsey Institute. He said, “two gazelles won’t mate in front of a lion.” That’s a great line, it’s a great line.

kara swisher

[LAUGHS]

esther perel

That’s what’s happening at this point. But they have done research on sex under Covid and, on the other end, while stress has constricted us, there is also findings that show that people have shared more fantasy with each other. When they do remain active, freedom in confinement comes through your imagination.

kara swisher

That’s interesting.

esther perel

But some people, at this point, even their friends they don’t touch. And their children they don’t touch. And people are touch-starved. And you can live without sex. But we don’t live well without touch. We become irritable, depressed, aggressive. Touch is vital food for us. Our body is our biggest organ, the skin. And it needs to be touched. It soothes us, it calms us, it reassures us, it connects us. What does it mean to work remote? When are we going to be able to once again come together like this?

kara swisher

How do you get back from that? Do you think people will, or do they kind of like this state? You counseling sessions focus on work, and your podcast “How’s Work,” how is that going to change?

esther perel

When you work, at this moment, you’re not working from home. You’re working with home. All your roles are collapsing while you’re sitting on the same chair at the same table. You are colleague, boss, parent, lover, friend, all of it. And no boundaries, no transitions. That is part of the exhaustion. People usually experience their activities in a localized way. You go to the gym, you go to the restaurant, you go to see friends, you change, your drive in between. It’s in space and in time you transition. You don’t have any of that right now. So it’s very important for people to create routines, boundaries, rituals, that delineate between the personal the professional, the day and the evening, the work and the leisure. And more than ever, people will probably continue to appreciate whatever can be digitized, you can do remote. Whatever is interpersonal. That is the serendipitous, the creative. The connections of people that come together to work, to do things, you will need to at some point find ways to come back together.

kara swisher

Do you think people will stay in the remote zone? Because a lot of bosses —

esther perel

No, they’re really hybrids.

kara swisher

— are talking about it.

esther perel

Everybody is talking about relational intelligence in the workplace at this moment. Everyone’s talking about empathic leadership, the soft skills gap, the importance of wellness and mental health in the workplace. Everyone understands that certain things can remain remote and maybe there’s an advantage to that. And if there is an option for hybrid, that’s OK. But everything that touches on the interpersonal, people are seeing the effects of the lack thereof. And we may not come back to the same office in the same way, with open cubicles and all of this stuff. But we understand that you cannot replace in-person.

kara swisher

In-person relationships. So you don’t think that’s good.

esther perel

In-person and interpersonal.

kara swisher

But people feel you can. Because people have done OK with Zoom. I mean, how do you look at something like Zoom?

esther perel

You do tasks. You can do projects. But can I walk with you to the coffee machine, and in between you say, “what are you working on?” And I say something, and I say, why don’t you come see me in my office for a second. And then suddenly I discovered that there is a whole other division in the company that I didn’t know of, and now you become my mentor.

kara swisher

So you cannot do those without being physically present.

esther perel

No. Because the meetings are stilted. We are sitting here on this screen, we only see half bodies. And then we basically close and we go into the next one, into the next one. We can accomplish things. It’s not like we can’t. But task is only one portion of what happens at work. And, especially today, work is an identity project. It’s a place where we go to experience meaning, community, belonging, purpose. And money, and survival.

kara swisher

So if this is going to go on for six more months or if people really move, how do you maintain the intimacy of work?

esther perel

I have done a lot with my own team. I’ve tried out ways to really talk with each other, check in with each other about all kinds of things that are not specifically related to what we are doing in work. So that we’re asking people about how their self care, we have conversations about political differences inside their family. We talk, actually, not about what they do, but who they are and what’s happening for them.

kara swisher

So that’s a technique.

esther perel

So that there is a sense with each other. Now, I have a small team. But as a whole, that the idea is, take time away from those meetings and make sure to reach out to the people. And to talk to them, and to find out what’s going on in their home.

kara swisher

And in terms of creating the boundary between life and work, what’s the one or two things people should do?

esther perel

Small things of all sorts. Change. Get dressed when you go to work. Change, make a demarcation. If you say that we’re going to spend the evening together, if you go out it’s one thing, but if you are going to stay home, imagine yourself actually going out.

kara swisher

Demarcation.

esther perel

Demarcation. Clothing is a very good demarcation. But also clearing the space. Demarcation is going outside for a walk for a moment, and just half an hour or 20 minutes, something that takes you away from the thing. Demarcation is music. It’s listening to not just words, but music. Demarcation is movement. Do not stay, this is extremely stilted. You get exhausted on Zoom. Partly because I think I’m looking at you but I’m actually not. We can’t have eye contact. And I think I look at you, but I’m searching for you on the screen the whole time. And you sit, and you sit. So all of these things are basic, small interventions that I think you see everywhere. There’s nothing unique in what I will prescribe on.

kara swisher

And removing technology is one thing. Whether you’re on your Pelotons, or you’re on your phones, or other things. I’m in love with my phone. I wanted to marry my phone at one point. You said we should look to children for ways to deal with these stressful times. I agree with you, having a baby, and my kids have been really. Great, not perfect. But I think my kids are handling it better than I am in lot of ways. What can we learn from children?

esther perel

I think that freedom in confinement comes through our imagination. It’s directly taken from children. A child sits in front of you, they stand up, they turn around, and they say “And now, I am the Sheriff.” “And now, I am the teacher.” They can instantly, through their imagination, elude reality, enter another world, play and escape the limits of reality that are weighing on them. The one thing we have is our imagination. It’s what people have used in confinement, in jail, in concentration camps, always.

kara swisher

It is so hard to do it, now. It’s you’re so stressed. I watched my daughter play with keys for a half an hour the other day. I was so comforted by her playing. And she was obsessed with the keys, just staring at them, over and over again. And I thought, how is she doing that?

esther perel

Partly, if you diminish some of the news-watching. You need to wean yourself a little bit.

kara swisher

I’m scared, there’s an election at stake. And I have an impact on it, if only I watched, I will be the one affecting it.

esther perel

But more of the same will actually not be the thing that helps you. You may have more chance to have a new thought if you’re less listening to the cacophony and you actually remove yourself for a moment and you let your mind open up. And thoughts will come and you actually may have insights that you don’t have when all you hear is the same all the time, whichever side you’re on.

kara swisher

That is a fair point. So, Esther, do you want to therapize Donald Trump any more? You said it’s impossible. Do you feel like you could do it? If he leaves, if he has some time?

esther perel

No. No, I would be working harder than him. And that would make me more responsible for his change than he himself. And that is never a good option for a therapist.

kara swisher

So are there people not available for therapy?

esther perel

Of course. Of course. There are people who do not experience the ache. Because the ache is deflected on others. Others experience the consequences of their behavior. So they have to carry no responsibility for it. And when you work with people like that, you work harder than them. You can never work harder than the patient themselves in therapy. You can’t want your kids to do their homework more than they would want it themselves. You observe. And then you carry the burden. And why would they do it, then, because you’re holding it for them. So you cannot work in therapy. No, not everybody is a candidate for therapy.

kara swisher

All right, so for those of us who are, we going to be OK Esther? You have to say yes. You don’t.

esther perel

Yes, I think we will be OK. I think that people have endured a lot. I actually think this is a moment to look at everybody in America. Black people in America, people who have not had privilege, anybody who hasn’t had privilege. And we learn a lot from these people. They continue to love, they continue to celebrate, they continue to have children. My parents came out of five years of concentration camp and the first thing they did was have a child. Because that showed that they were still human. And I think that there is a spirit in us that will continue to create the world that we live in. And then mixed with grief, and mixed with sadness, and mixed with loss, and mixed with rage, we will continue to do what we’ve done forever.

kara swisher

Esther, thank you so much, as usual.

esther perel

It’s a pleasure. Thank you, me too.

kara swisher

Beautiful, beautiful discussion. I really appreciate it.

3,2020-11-09 00:00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/republicans-trump-concede-2020-election.html,"Republicans Back Trump’s Refusal to Concede, Declining to Recognize Biden","In Georgia, where the continuing vote count showed Mr. Trump losing the state’s electoral votes, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler — both Republicans now facing January runoffs to keep their seats — took the extraordinary step of calling on the state’s top election official to resign. Declaring Georgia’s handling of the election an “embarrassment” and citing vague “failures” in an echo of Mr. Trump’s evidence-free charges of stolen votes, they said Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, had failed the state.

Mr. Raffensperger bluntly rejected their calls, declaring the senators’ claims “laughable” and suggesting that they were merely disgruntled because Mr. Trump might lose and their jobs were on the line.

The intraparty feuding underscored how political considerations around Georgia, whose two Senate contests will most likely decide control of the chamber two weeks before Inauguration Day, are driving Republicans’ calculations about how to handle the election results. Republican leaders are reluctant to make any move that might alienate Mr. Trump’s loyal supporters and hurt their candidates’ chances. That includes appearing to bow to the reality that he has lost before the president himself is ready to do so.

There was little sign on Monday that would happen in the near term. Mr. Trump’s team rolled out its latest legal moves to challenge the outcome in key states. And in Washington, Emily W. Murphy, a Trump political appointee and administrator of the General Services Administration, refused to formally recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect with a letter of “ascertainment,” leaving the country’s transition of power in flux.

Unperturbed, Mr. Biden plunged ahead with a transition operation that was quickly getting off the ground. In Wilmington, Del., he announced the creation of a Covid-19 advisory board and made an urgent plea to Americans to wear face masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He fielded a call from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, as a legion of advisers worked quickly to begin lining up candidates to fill top agency posts."

A third would be because the president wants to take actions that he believes his secretary of defense would refuse to take, which would be alarming. Whatever the reason, casting aside a secretary of defense during the volatile days of transition seems to neglect the president’s most important duty: to protect our national security.”

Mr. Esper’s downfall had been expected for months, after he took the rare step of disagreeing publicly with Mr. Trump in June and saying that active-duty military troops should not be sent to control the wave of protests in American cities.

The defense secretary was aware that he was likely to be fired, but Pentagon officials said he hoped to continue serving as long as possible to try to sustain orderly leadership of the Defense Department. Although Mr. Esper had a resignation letter prepared, his allies said he did not think anything was imminent from Mr. Trump on Monday.

But the president expressed his ire in the Oval Office on Monday morning, and the White House gave Mr. Esper only a few minutes’ advance notice of his firing.

In a two-page letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Esper said, “I serve the country in deference to the Constitution, so I accept your decision to replace me.”

Friends and colleagues of the new acting secretary praised Mr. Miller’s Army Special Forces background and counterterrorism credentials but expressed surprise that he had been elevated to such a senior position, even in a temporary capacity. Mr. Miller does not have the stature to push back on any precipitous actions that Mr. Trump might press in his final weeks in office, colleagues said.

“A move like this probably sends a chill through the senior ranks of the military,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, a former top counterterrorism official in the Bush and Obama administrations, said in an email. “Not because of anything about Chris Miller personally, though it’s a highly unconventional choice, to be sure. But simply because a move like this contributes to a sense of instability and unstable decision-making at exactly the time when you want to avoid sending that kind of message around the world.”"
5,2020-11-09 00:00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/trump-pac.html,Trump Plans PAC in Hopes of Keeping Hold on G.O.P.,"President Trump is planning to form a so-called leadership political action committee, a federal fund-raising vehicle that will potentially let him retain his hold on the Republican Party even when he is out of office, officials said on Monday.

The announcement is expected as soon as this week, just days after the major news networks and newspapers, as well as The Associated Press, called the 2020 election for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Such committees can accept donations of up to $5,000 per donor per year — far less than the donation limits for the committees formed by Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee — but a leadership PAC could accept donations from an unlimited number of people. It could also accept donations from other political action committees.

A leadership PAC could spend an unlimited amount in so-called independent expenditures to benefit other candidates, as well as fund travel, polling and consultants.

Squabble,"ATLANTA — A rift among Georgia Republicans exploded into public view on Monday as the state’s incumbent senators, both locked in fierce runoff fights for their seats, lashed out at the Republican officials who oversaw last week’s election and leveled unfounded claims of a faulty process lacking in transparency.

The all-out intraparty war erupted as the vote count in Georgia on Monday continued to show President Trump narrowly trailing President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement calling for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and condemning the election as an “embarrassment.”

“We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out — even when it’s in your own party,” the senators said in their statement, which did not offer any specific allegations or elaborate on how they believed Mr. Raffensperger had fallen short, except to accuse him of “mismanagement and lack of transparency.”"

The presidential race in Arizona remained too close to call on Monday evening, but Joseph R. Biden Jr. held a lead in the state’s biggest city. Phoenix and its suburbs swung to the left, making it possible that Mr. Biden wins Arizona, even as other areas shifted to President Trump.

Maricopa County comprises 60 percent of the state’s voters and is home to Phoenix. Mr. Trump narrowly won the county in 2016, and support for Republicans has slipped there in recent elections. Voters there supported Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, in the 2018 Senate race.

Within Maricopa County, Mr. Biden won in most precincts with a majority Hispanic population, though often with smaller margins than Democrats saw in 2016.

Mr. Biden also won in many precincts that skewed younger.

The shift to the left in Maricopa County has helped put Mr. Biden ahead statewide. His reportedly strong support among Native Americans in the state has also been a benefit.

Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

“But to do so when there is no such evidence — and when the president’s clear strategy is to delegitimize the results of a proper election — is one of the more problematic acts of any attorney general in my lifetime,” Mr. Vladeck added.

Mr. Pilger, a career prosecutor in the department’s Public Integrity Section who oversaw voting-fraud-related investigations, told colleagues he would move to a nonsupervisory role working on corruption prosecutions.

“Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications,” he wrote, “I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.” A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pilger’s message.

Justice Department policies prohibit federal prosecutors from taking overt steps, like questioning witnesses or securing subpoenas for documents, to open a criminal investigation into any election-related matter until after voting results have been certified to keep their existence from spilling into public view and influencing either voters or local election officials who ensure the integrity of the results.

“Public knowledge of a criminal investigation could impact the adjudication of election litigation and contests in state courts,” the Justice Department’s longstanding election guidelines for prosecutors say. “Accordingly, it is the general policy of the department not to conduct overt investigations.”

More covert investigative steps, like an investigator going undercover, are allowed but require the permission of a career prosecutor in the department’s Criminal Division."

His victory in 2016 was decided by just 77,000 votes spread across three Northern battleground states, fewer than the crowd at an average Big Ten football game on a Saturday, at least before the pandemic.

Since the start of his campaign in early 2019, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made the case that he could beat Mr. Trump precisely because of the strength he would have in those states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — where his unpretentious, approachable style and moderate politics would connect with voters.

On Election Day, Mr. Biden’s analysis prevailed. He won every state. Here is a look at the dynamics that worked in his favor.

Even as the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 3 percent on news of the vaccine, the economy remained depressed by the spread of the virus. There were 10 million fewer Americans working in October than in February, according to the Labor Department, and the pace of job growth has slowed every month since June. Airlines and other tourism-related industries are nowhere close to regaining their normal levels of customers. And several indicators suggest consumers have pulled back on dining and some other activities in recent weeks as infections have surged anew.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York raised doubts that the Trump administration could handle vaccine distribution, even if a vaccine did become available in the coming weeks, suggesting that governors would have to step in.

“The Trump administration is rolling out the vaccination plan, and I believe it’s flawed,” Mr. Cuomo said Monday on “Good Morning America” on ABC. “They’re basically going to have the private providers do it, and that’s going to leave out all sorts of communities that were left out the first time when Covid ravaged them.”

Mr. Biden, moving to signal to Americans that he is prepared to take charge after a chaotic year, named a new coronavirus task force headed by a former commissioner of food and drugs, Dr. David Kessler; a former surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy; and a Yale public health expert, Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith.

Mr. Biden will have the difficult task of governing a country that is deeply divided about how much the government should do to slow the virus at the expense of jobs, schooling, recreation, socializing and religious gatherings. The president-elect vowed to “spare no effort” in fighting the virus, with the goal of getting the economy “running at full speed again.”

His comments contrasted Mr. Trump’s. The president has spent the past eight months dismissing or playing down the need for Americans to wear masks, saying frequently — and falsely — that public health experts disagree about masks’ effectiveness."

Pfizer’s progress could bode well for Moderna’s vaccine, which uses similar technology. A Moderna spokesman said that it expected interim findings from its study this month.

Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to rush a vaccine to market, has promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government, which will be given to Americans free of charge. But Dr. Jansen sought to distance the company from Operation Warp Speed and presidential politics, noting that the company — unlike the other vaccine front-runners — did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development.

“We were never part of the Warp Speed,” she said on Sunday. “We have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.” On Monday, a spokeswoman for Pfizer clarified that the company is part of Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential coronavirus vaccine.

Dr. Jansen said she learned of the results from the outside panel of experts shortly after 1 p.m. on Sunday, and that the timing was not influenced by the election. “We have always said that science is driving how we conduct ourselves — no politics,” she said.

The data released by Pfizer Monday was delivered in a news release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. It is not conclusive evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, and the initial finding of more than 90 percent efficacy could change as the trial goes on.

“We need to see the actual data, and we’re going to need longer-term results,” said Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University. Still, he said, “it’s a testament to hard work and science that we’re getting results that are so good and so fast.”

Other scientists were stunned by the data so far.

“This is really a spectacular number,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. “I wasn’t expecting it to be this high. I was preparing myself for something like 55 percent.”"

Pfizer and its partner, the German company, BioNTech, announced preliminary results that suggested their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective.

The news — the first results from any late-stage vaccine trial — buoyed stock markets and spirits as the public saw a glimmer of hope. But it’s worth noting that the news is still preliminary, and there is much that is still not known about how well the vaccine works.

And one thing remained clear: The vaccine will not come in time to rescue the world from the next several months, when the virus will take many more lives unless the public takes more stringent public health measures.

Here’s what we know, and don’t know, about the vaccine.

What did these scientists find out?

In July, Pfizer and BioNTech initiated a late-stage clinical trial on a coronavirus vaccine. Half of the people got the vaccine, while the other half got a placebo of salt water. The companies then waited for people to get sick to determine if the vaccine offered any protection."

Approval,"Covid-19: Eli Lilly’s Antibody Treatment Gets Emergency F.D.A. Approval Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, is the latest in a long line of Trump administration officials and associates to contract the virus. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced his virus advisory board. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

The F.D.A. gave emergency approval to Eli Lilly’s antibody treatment. A researcher with Eli Lilly testing possible coronavirus antibodies in a laboratory in Indianapolis earlier this year. Credit... David Morrison/Eli Lilly, via Associated Press The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization of a Covid-19 treatment made by the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly that was given to Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, when he was infected with the coronavirus. The authorization, announced on Monday, applies only to people newly infected with the virus, and the agency said it should not be used in hospitalized patients. The treatment is approved for people 12 and older who have tested positive and are at risk for developing a severe form of Covid-19 or being hospitalized for the condition. That includes people who are over 65 and obese, the agency said — a key group that early studies have shown can benefit the most from the treatment. Eli Lilly said that its treatment, called bamlanivimab, should be administered as soon as possible after a positive test, and within 10 days of developing symptoms. “It’s a great day for science and medicine — sort of a feat of what’s possible,” said Dr. Daniel M. Skovronsky, the chief scientific officer of Eli Lilly. The company and its collaborators, including the National Institutes of Health, he said, were able “to create a new drug, manufacture it, test it in clinical trials, and get it authorized for use in just seven months.” In October, the company announced that it had reached a $375 million deal to sell 300,000 doses of the treatment to the U.S. government. Eli Lilly said Monday that it would begin shipping the treatment immediately to AmerisourceBergen, a national distributor, which will then distribute it on behalf of the federal government. The treatment consists of a single powerful antibody that is believed to keep the infection in check, and has been shown in early studies to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations in patients who get the drug early in the course of their disease. It is similar to the treatment that President Trump received, made by the American biotech company Regeneron, which is a cocktail of two antibodies. Regeneron has also applied for emergency authorization. Mr. Christie disclosed this fall that he had received the Lilly treatment on an emergency basis after he was infected with the virus. Eli Lilly’s authorization raised immediate questions about who would get access to the treatments, which must be infused in a clinic or hospital. The company has said it expects to have enough to treat one million people by the end of the year. That means, even in the best-case scenario, there won’t be nearly enough to curb a virus that is now infecting an average of more than 116,000 people a day in the United States. “It’s kind of the best times for these therapies to enter, because they can have an impact,” said Dr. Walid Gellad, who leads the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s also the worst time because we don’t have enough doses, and it’s going to add to the backlog of testing.” More than 130,500 new cases were announced in the United States on Monday, the second-highest total of the pandemic, and the sixth day in a row the country exceeded 100,000 cases in a single day. Twelve states and the territory of Guam set single-day records for new cases. — Katie Thomas and

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times At least three people who attended an election party at the White House last week, including the housing secretary and President Trump’s chief of staff, have tested positive for the coronavirus. Several hundred people gathered at the event in the East Room for several hours, many of them not wearing masks as they mingled and watched election returns. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, according to a spokesman for the agency. He is the latest in a long list of administration officials, including Mr. Trump, to contract the virus. “He is in good spirits and feels fortunate to have access to effective therapeutics, which aid and markedly speed his recovery,” Coalter Baker, the agency’s deputy chief of staff, said in an email. Mr. Baker did not specify which treatments Mr. Carson had received or would receive. Another is David Bossie, an adviser Mr. Trump recently appointed to be the face of his efforts to contest vote tabulations in states like Nevada and Georgia, two people familiar with the diagnosis said on Monday. Mr. Bossie tested positive on Sunday and told campaign officials of the result. The third person from the election party is Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who tested positive for the virus the day after the election, aides said, although Mr. Meadows tried to keep it quiet. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. made an urgent plea on Monday for Americans to wear masks to slow the spread of the virus, declaring that “a mask is not a political statement.” He said the pandemic would be his top priority when he replaced Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. With the world anxiously awaiting any positive news about a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people, the drug maker Pfizer announced on Monday that its coronavirus vaccine appeared to be robustly effective, based on an early analysis of trial results. Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, has defended Mr. Trump’s response to the virus and is a member of the White House virus task force. At 69, Mr. Carson is at an elevated risk for complications. He is also a cancer survivor, having undergone surgery in 2002 for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. “I really came down with symptoms yesterday. Fever of 101. Chills. Muscle cramps. Respiratory issues and fatigue,” Mr. Carson told The Washington Post. According to Armstrong Williams, a friend and personal adviser to Mr. Carson, the secretary felt ill over the weekend and was examined and tested early Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “I was just on the phone with him,” Mr. Williams said in an interview at midday on Monday. “He said he was feeling pretty bad over the last couple of days, but he was feeling a lot better now. Carson’s going to live. Carson’s going to be OK.” Some patients who seem to fare well in the first week after diagnosis become seriously ill in the second week. Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy, accompanied him to Walter Reed and was tested, but the results were not back yet, Mr. Williams said. It was not clear which kind of test each had taken. The secretary was one of several hundred people at the White House party, according to people with knowledge of the situation. But Mr. Williams said that Mr. Carson thinks he caught the virus before then, while campaigning for Mr. Trump by bus before Election Day. It was not immediately clear why Mr. Carson thinks so. Five other White House aides and a Trump campaign adviser also tested positive in the days before and after Election Day, people familiar with the diagnoses told The Times on Friday. — Glenn Thrush and

Biden adds vaccine official fired by Trump to his Covid-19 panel. Video President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. made remarks on his plan to fight Covid-19 and build back the economy. Credit Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. named Dr. Rick Bright, a former top vaccine official in the Trump administration who submitted a whistle-blower complaint to Congress, as a member of a Covid-19 panel to advise him during the transition, officials announced Monday. Dr. Bright, who was ousted as the head of a federal medical research agency, told lawmakers that officials in the government had failed to heed his warnings about acquiring masks and other supplies. He said that Americans died from the virus because of the Trump administration’s failure to act. “Lives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,” Dr. Bright, the former director of the Department of Health and Human Services’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, told a House subcommittee in May. Mr. Biden’s decision to put Dr. Bright on his advisory panel is a signal that the incoming administration intends to confront the virus — which is surging across the country — in a very different way than President Trump, who sought to largely push responsibility onto states. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Biden said the advisory board would help him shape his “approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations.” After meeting with the board on Monday, Mr. Biden urged all Americans to wear masks and vowed to make defeating the pandemic his No. 1 priority when he takes office on Jan. 20. “It doesn’t matter your party, your point of view. We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months,” Mr. Biden said. On Sunday, the nation surpassed 10 million cases and sank deeper into the grip of what could become the worst chapter yet of the pandemic. The rate of new cases is soaring: The seven-day average across the United States rose to more than 116,000 a day, as of Monday. With 29 states setting weekly case records, the virus is surging in more than half the country. Nationwide, hospitalizations have nearly doubled since mid-September, and deaths are slowly increasing again. The nation’s worsening outlook comes at an extremely difficult juncture: Mr. Trump, who remains in office until January, is openly at odds with his own coronavirus advisers, and winter, when infections are only expected to spread faster, is coming. The three co-chairs of Mr. Biden’s virus advisory board are: Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, a former surgeon general, who has been a key Biden adviser for months and is expected to take a major public role; Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who worked closely with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top epidemiologist, to speed development and approval of H.I.V. drugs; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale University. The 13-member panel will also include Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist and the chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Emanuel is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who served as White House chief of staff under former President Barack Obama and as the mayor of Chicago. Dr. Emanuel has been a high-profile advocate of a more aggressive approach to the virus. The other members of the panel are: Dr. Atul Gawande, a professor of surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine; Dr. Julie Morita, the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota; Loyce Pace, the executive director and president of the Global Health Council; Dr. Luciana Borio, a National Security Council aide under Mr. Trump and acting chief F.D.A. scientist under Mr. Obama; and Dr. Robert Rodriguez and Dr. Eric Goosby of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. And Dr. Fauci said on Monday that he would stay at his post atop the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases after Mr. Biden’s inauguration, telling CNN that he has “no intention of leaving.” “I’ve been doing it” — working in public health — “under six presidents,” Dr. Fauci said. “It’s an important job and my goal is to serve the American public no matter what the administration is.” — Michael D.

N.J. adds restrictions on restaurants and nightclubs, as N.Y.C.’s mayor calls the virus positivity rate spike ‘dangerous.’ Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:40 - 0:00 transcript ‘We Can Stop a Second Wave,’ N.Y.C. Mayor Says Coronavirus cases in New York are swiftly rising, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that the city was “dangerously close” to a second wave that might mean more restrictions. Unfortunately we’re also dealing with an immense challenge this morning because we see the presence of the coronavirus in the city and it’s trying to reassert itself. And we have to do everything in our power while we’re waiting for that help from the federal government to finally come, we need to do everything in our power to stop the coronavirus from reasserting in New York City. We have to stop a second wave from happening here. It is getting dangerously close. I’ve been telling you for weeks that we had the ability to stop a second wave. And for weeks, actually, our numbers were higher than we wanted, but they had leveled off. Now, unfortunately, we’re seeing a real growth in the positivity rate in the city. And that is dangerous. So we have one last chance to stop a second wave. It’s as simple as this. This is my message to all New Yorkers today: We can stop a second wave if we act immediately. But we have one last chance. So the more that people wear masks, practice social distancing, all those basics, the more we’re able to fight back that second wave. So I can’t give you a timeline. It will actually depend on how people respond to your reporting and everything else we put out there. If they take decisive action, it can make a huge difference. But it is important, I think, to lay out the danger in terms of new restrictions because I think it will make it very visual, very real to people what we’re up against. God forbid this continued and we had a full-blown second wave, it means a lot more restrictions. It means, unfortunately, it could mean even having to shut down parts of our economy again, which would be horrible for this city, horrible for the livelihoods of people. Coronavirus cases in New York are swiftly rising, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that the city was “dangerously close” to a second wave that might mean more restrictions. Credit Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times As coronavirus cases have surged to records across the United States, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey laid out new restrictions for the state on Monday, calling for restaurants and nightclubs to shut down indoor service at 10 p.m. starting Thursday, and saying that no one may be seated directly at the bar. High school sports teams are not permitted to participate in out-of-state tournaments, but college athletes may still travel. Mr. Murphy said he would continue to consider additional targeted restrictions on nonessential businesses. New Jersey’s seven-day average of coronavirus cases now exceeds 2,000 infections a day, or 24 per 100,000 people, the highest rate since May. Last week, the average rate of positive tests, a key indicator of a state’s control of the virus, reached 6 percent. Hospitalizations have also been rising, though death rates have not spiked. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the new rules would be designed to “shave at the edges,” without imposing a full lockdown. The new limits on businesses come about two weeks after Newark, the state’s largest city, took similar action on its own to confront a hot spot centered in the Ironbound neighborhood, one of the state’s most thriving restaurant districts. And in the New York City area, officials had also hoped to keep the outbreak at bay and press ahead with its slow but steady recovery from the dark days of spring. But now, its forecast is turning more alarming, too. The number of new cases is swiftly rising, with more than 1,000 cases identified in New York City four days in a row this past week, or 12 per 100,000 people, a level that last occurred in May, according to a New York Times database. Though new restrictions would be up to the governor, city health officials and Mayor Bill de Blasio’s aides have been discussing whether new citywide restrictions should be imposed, including a broader shutdown of nonessential businesses if the citywide seven-day average rate of positive virus test results climbs, and stays, above 3 percent. The figure was 2.21 percent, according to the city’s health department. Hospitalizations and death rates are a small fraction of what they were at the height of the pandemic, and case count comparisons can be tricky, given that much more testing is occurring now. Around the state, the daily average of new cases for the last seven days was 2,757, or 14 per 100,000 people as of Sunday, according to the Times database. What’s more, the positivity rate in New York City is still well below that in neighboring states. Mr. de Blasio said on Monday that “now, unfortunately, we are seeing a real growth in the positivity rate in the city, and that is dangerous.” He added, “This is my message to all New Yorkers: We can stop a second wave if we act immediately, but we have one last chance and everyone has to be a part of it.” The city’s contact tracing program has disclosed few details about which trends and patterns are contributing to transmission. But one city health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share details from internal discussions, said clusters had been traced to workplaces, including construction sites and offices. The mayor said that further lockdowns were possible should New York City not regain control of the virus. “God forbid this continued and we had a full-blown second wave,” he said. “It means a lot more restrictions. Unfortunately, it could mean even having to shut down parts of our economy again.” It could also mean having to close schools, he said. The mayor has previously said that he favored halting indoor dining if the seven-day positivity rate reached 2 percent — a threshold that has already been crossed without his taking any action. On Monday, the mayor would only say that it was time to re-evaluate the wisdom of allowing limited indoor dining. At his own news conference, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the so-called red zone covering parts of Brooklyn was being downgraded to orange, which allows for less severe restrictions. Parts of Erie, Monroe and Onondaga counties would face greater restrictions, though, he said. “This is going to be the constant for the foreseeable future,” Mr. Cuomo said of his “whack-a-mole” approach to battling the virus. “Every couple of days we’ll say, ‘This place became a microcluster, this place is no longer a microcluster.’” — Tracey Tully, Joseph Goldstein, Dana Rubinstein and

Jeenah Moon/Getty Images The drug maker Pfizer announced on Monday that an early analysis of its coronavirus vaccine trial suggested the vaccine was robustly effective in preventing Covid-19, a promising development as the world has waited anxiously for any positive news about a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people. Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with the German drug maker BioNTech, released only sparse details from its clinical trial, based on the first formal review of the data by an outside panel of experts. Pfizer said that the analysis found that the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease among trial volunteers who had no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. If the results hold up, that level of protection would put it on par with highly effective childhood vaccines for diseases such as measles. No serious safety concerns have been observed, the company said. Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of the two-dose vaccine later this month, after it has collected the recommended two months of safety data. By the end of the year it will have manufactured enough doses to immunize 15 to 20 million people, company executives have said. Independent scientists have cautioned against hyping early results before long-term safety and efficacy data has been collected. Still, Pfizer is the first company to announce positive results from a late-stage vaccine trial. Eleven vaccines are in late-stage trials, including four in the United States. Pfizer’s progress could bode well for Moderna’s vaccine, which uses similar technology. The news comes just days after Joseph R. Biden Jr. clinched a victory over President Trump in the presidential election. Mr. Trump had repeatedly hinted a vaccine would be ready before Election Day, Nov. 3. This fall, Pfizer’s chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, frequently claimed that the company could have a “readout” by October, something that did not come to pass. Both Mr. Trump and President-elect Biden hailed the news on Monday. Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to rush a vaccine to market, has promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government, which will be given to Americans free of charge. But in an interview, Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice president and the head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, sought to distance the company from Operation Warp Speed and presidential politics, noting that the company — unlike the other vaccine front-runners — did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development. Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. She said she learned of the results from the outside panel of experts shortly after 1 p.m. on Sunday, and that the timing was not influenced by the election. “We have always said that science is driving how we conduct ourselves — no politics,” she said. The data released by Pfizer on Monday was delivered in a news release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. It is not conclusive evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, and the initial finding of more than 90 percent efficacy could change as the trial goes on. — Katie Thomas, David Gelles and

Once again, Cuomo blasts Trump’s vaccine distribution plan, calling it ‘flawed.’ Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has said that President Trump’s vaccination distribution plan could leave out communities that are disproportionately affected by the virus. Credit... Mark Lennihan/Associated Press In the wake of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election and the latest optimistic reports about the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York once again assailed President Trump’s vaccine distribution plan, saying, “We can’t let this vaccination plan go forward the way the Trump administration is designing it.” “The Trump administration is rolling out the vaccination plan and I believe it’s flawed,” Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Monday. “They’re basically going to have the private providers do it, and that’s going to leave out all sorts of communities that were left out the first time when Covid ravaged them.” Mr. Cuomo’s comments came even as he acknowledged that Pfizer’s results were “great news,” but some conservatives quickly accused the governor of trying to politicize the issue and hamper vaccine distribution efforts. In a statement, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said: “After this nasty virus has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and put millions out of work, it is beyond disgusting that Governor Cuomo would use a glimmer of hope for another worn-out ‘Trump is bad’ talking point. When we get a vaccine, we’re going to need all hands on deck distributing it as fast as possible. Shamelessly politicizing this is dangerous and stupid.” For months, Mr. Cuomo has raised concerns about the White House’s vaccination strategy, claiming that the rush to develop a vaccine has become so politicized that people might have serious trepidations about a vaccine’s safety. As chairman of the National Governors Association, Mr. Cuomo has accused the federal government of not providing states with sufficient answers on how governors should prepare to distribute a vaccine. Those concerns prompted Mr. Cuomo to announce in September a state task force that is supposed to review any vaccines authorized by the federal government before they are distributed in New York. Last month, the governor released a draft plan outlining the broad contours of how the vaccine would be distributed in New York, where up to 40 million doses could be needed for the state’s 19 million residents. Mr. Cuomo said priority would be given to essential workers and those considered most vulnerable. Mr. Cuomo has also said that relying on the private sector, including pharmacies, could leave out minority communities that have already been disproportionately affected by the virus. While the plan isn’t finalized, a report released by the Department of Health and Human Services says that the most at-risk populations would indeed be prioritized in the initial phases of distribution, which will entail partnerships with local governments and public health sites, in addition to pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes. —

Ukraine’s president becomes the latest world leader to test positive for the virus. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Credit... Pool photo by Will Oliver Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the latest leader to contract the virus despite the extensive protective measures available to a head of state. Mr. Zelensky, who is 42 and not known to have any of the underlying conditions that could put him at risk of developing severe illness from the virus, said in a post in English on Twitter that he felt “good” and was taking vitamins, adding, “it’s gonna be fine!” The Ukrainian president said he intended to isolate himself but keep working. It was not clear if he had shown any symptoms. The president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has also tested positive, according to a statement he posted on Facebook minutes after the president’s tweet. Cases have been shooting up in Ukraine. The country reported an average of 9,525 cases per day over the past seven days. Mr. Zelensky has consistently urged Ukrainians to wear masks and to take other coronavirus precautions seriously. He often appears in public wearing a mask or on television conducting business by video conference. Critics have, however, taken issue with a decision by his political party, which controls Parliament, to allocate more than half of a coronavirus relief fund intended for hospitals to road construction instead. Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, was elected president last spring and within months became entangled in an American political scandal when President Trump requested, in a telephone call, that he investigate now President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Biden’s family. Mr. Zelensky’s wife, Olena Zelenska, had a mild case of Covid-19 in June. At the time, Mr. Zelensky said he isolated for a time but tested negative. —

Notre Dame grapples with fallout from a raucous football victory celebration. After Notre Dame defeated Clemson, 47-40, in double overtime, Fighting Irish fans stormed the field. Credit... Pool photo by Matt Cashore It will be a while before the University of Notre Dame knows whether the boisterous on-field celebration following the football team’s double-overtime victory against top-ranked Clemson will cause a surge in students testing positive for the coronavirus. But the school isn’t waiting to react. Faculty members and administrators are already debating stronger measures to prevent the virus from spreading as students take final exams and go home for Thanksgiving. Thousands of students leapt over brick walls, dashed past overwhelmed security guards and stormed the field on Saturday, gleefully mobbing the Notre Dame players and one another for more than 15 minutes and ignoring loudspeaker announcements to retreat. DOWN GOES NO.1!



Notre Dame upset No.1 Clemson in double overtime 😱 pic.twitter.com/1UqRaUIbRL — Notre Dame on NBC (@NDonNBC) November 8, 2020 In a letter to the student body Sunday night, the Rev. John Jenkins, the president of the university, called the “widespread disregard” of the school’s health and safety guidelines over the weekend “very disappointing,” and said there would be “zero tolerance” for noncompliance, either on campus or off. (A spokesman for the university said on Monday that Father Jenkins was not referring specifically to the football game, but to other gatherings.) Any student who does not get tested for the coronavirus, or who leaves South Bend before the results are known, will not be allowed to graduate or register for next semester’s classes, he wrote. But Father Jenkins’s credibility on campus is wearing thin. He has twice had to apologize for failing to wear a mask when he should have: posing for photos with returning students in August, and attending a White House reception where many attendees were infected, including him. In an email Monday to the faculty and staff, Dan Lindley, an associate professor of political science, urged university leaders to lock down the campus for the rest of the semester (classes end Thursday, followed by final exams). His letter was in response to one Sunday night from the school’s provost and vice president saying the school would not shut down classes. The crowd of 11,011 at the football game consisted almost entirely of students, university employees and players’ families. It will take several days, at least, before any infections caught at the stadium lead to symptoms or are detectable by tests. And Mark Fox, the deputy health director of St. Joseph County, Ind., who has been advising the university on pandemic response since August, said it may be difficult to definitively trace any new cases to the crush of students on the field. —

Hungary and Portugal plan curfews and new restrictions as cases surge. A soldier disinfecting the staircase in an elementary school in Szolnok, Hungary, last month. Credit... Janos Meszaros/MTI, via Associated Press Hungary and Portugal are the latest European countries to adopt new measures like curfews and limits on gatherings to curb rapid rises in new coronavirus cases. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said there would be a general curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., and that all public events would be banned, with family and private gatherings capped at 10 people. Restaurants will only offer delivery services and hotels will be limited to catering to business travelers. High schools and higher education institutions will be moving to online classes, and dormitories will be closed, although nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools will remain open. Sporting events will be held behind closed doors and gyms, indoor swimming pools, museums, theaters and zoos will be closed. The government will also extend some benefits, including payroll tax cuts and salary contributions, to the tourism and hospitality sector. The new rules will need to be approved by Parliament, which is controlled by Mr. Orban’s party, and would be in place for 30 days. Nearly 2,500 people have died after contracting the virus in Hungary since the start of the year, according to government figures, with three-quarters of the deaths occurring after Sept. 1. More than 114,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Hungary. Portugal returned on Monday to a state of emergency that gives its government enhanced powers to impose lockdown measures to stop a second wave of infections. But the government has so far opted for relatively lenient restrictions compared with those introduced recently in some other European countries. As of Monday, about 7.1 million of the 10 million residents of Portugal must respect a nighttime curfew that runs from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., as well as a stricter one during the coming two weekends, from 1 p.m. to 5 a.m. The government said it would review the situation after Nov. 23 before deciding whether to extend the state of emergency. On Friday, the country registered 5,550 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily figure since the pandemic started. The number of patients in Portugal’s intensive care units has also climbed this month to over 300, which is more than at the peak in April. In Andalusia, the southern region of Spain that borders Portugal and is home to about 8.4 million people, the regional authorities have ordered residents to remain within their municipalities. Bars and restaurants must close at 6 p.m., except in the province of Granada, where establishments must remain fully shuttered because of the high infection rate. Andalusia now has 457 Covid-19 patients in intensive care units, which is also a record. — Benjamin Novak and

Stocks jump, but fall short of a record, as Pfizer’s vaccine news adds to an election rally. Stocks on Wall Street fell short of a record on Monday, as a late retreat pulled back a soaring market. A relief-fueled rally had lifted the S&P 500 by as much as 3.9 percent earlier in the day, after the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said early data showed that its coronavirus vaccine appeared 90 percent effective. The announcement followed news on Saturday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had enough votes in the Electoral College to clinch the presidency, a sign that the American vote, which some investors had worried could spiral into a chaotic period if President Trump lost, appeared to proceed more or less normally. But the S&P 500 ended up just 1.2 percent by the end of trading, short of its Sept. 2 record. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 3 percent. The largest technology stocks, seen both as safe bets during the economic crisis and beneficiaries of a work-and-play-from-home environment during the pandemic, were sharply lower and helped drive the late pullback. Amazon fell 5 percent, Apple was 2 percent lower, and Microsoft fell more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.5 percent. Pfizer said a vaccine it was developing with BioNTech was found to have been more than 90 percent effective in preventing coronavirus infections, based on a large study. Pfizer said that by the end of the year it will have manufactured enough doses of the vaccine to immunize 15 million to 20 million people. Scientists have cautioned against hyping early results before long-term safety and efficacy data has been collected, and no one knows how long the vaccine’s protection might last. It is also likely to be months before Pfizer’s vaccine or any other is able to substantially curb the coronavirus outbreak, which is picking up steam around the world. That caution was lost on investors, who rushed into investments that would benefit from a world returning to some semblance of normalcy, and out of stocks that have become winners in the pandemic. “Hurdles still remain,” said Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We need to find out more about production capabilities, rollout and takeup. But for now, this is shifting the winners and losers.” Among the winners: American Airlines rose about 15 percent and United Airlines rose about 19 percent. Carnival, the cruise ship operator, rose 39 percent. Also sharply higher were the shopping center owners Simon Property Group and Kimco Realty, the concert promoter Live Nation and the office-building owner Vornado Realty Trust. By contrast, those whose businesses have been well suited to lockdowns and stay-at-home orders struggled. Peloton Interactive, which makes home exercise equipment, dropped 20 percent, while the streaming service Netflix fell 8.6 percent, for example. Over all, though, it was a global rally. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index surged 4 percent, its biggest one-day gain since March, while the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 4.7 percent. In Asian markets, which closed before Pfizer announced its news, the Nikkei 225 in Japan ended the day 2.1 percent stronger, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong finished up 1.2 percent. Crude oil prices also leapt about 9 percent, to more than $40 a barrel. Prices for government bonds — where investors traditionally park funds during times of uncertainty — tumbled sharply. Trading on Monday followed the best week for the S&P 500 since April, as investors became more convinced that President-elect Biden would govern alongside a Republican-held Senate. However, two runoff elections in Georgia mean that control of the Senate will not be known until January. — Eshe Nelson and

Utah imposes a mask mandate, as states try to calibrate responses to climbing case counts. Salt Lake County public health nurses at a testing site in Utah last month. Credit... Rick Bowmer/Associated Press Caught between the surging pandemic on the one hand, and political pressure to keep schools and businesses open on the other, many state governors have been trying to walk a fine line lately, by strongly urging mask-wearing and other precautions without mandating them. But the governor of Utah said on Sunday that he had to step over that line, and others may soon do the same. “Due to the alarming rate of Covid infections,” Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, wrote on Twitter, he was announcing a new state of emergency, including a mask mandate that would apply statewide. Social gatherings would be limited to “household only” for the next two weeks, he wrote, and all extracurricular activities at schools would be put on hold. He emphasized that the measures were “not shutting down our economy, but are absolutely necessary to save lives and hospital capacity.” Since Election Day, some states have shifted toward taking additional steps to rein in the virus, or have signaled that such action may be coming. Denver installed a “Home by 10” order on Sunday evening, instructing people to remain in their homes between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., except for essential activities. The order also prohibits “all public and private gatherings” between people from different households at all times. The mayor of Denver, Michael B. Hancock, warned that “there’s another stay at home order in our future” if the spread of the virus does not slow. The daily average of cases in Colorado has increased 114 percent over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. The order is set to expire at 5 a.m. on Dec. 7, though gatherings on Thanksgiving Day will be exempt. People who violate the order face a fine of up to $999. On Friday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy of Alaska extended his state’s emergency declaration for another 30 days, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois warned that a new stay-at-home order may be necessary if the virus’s spread in the state does not slow soon. In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy laid out new restrictions for the state on Monday, calling for restaurants and nightclubs to shut down indoor service at 10 p.m. starting Thursday, and saying that no one may be seated directly at the bar. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has called for the whole nation to be under a mask mandate, announced the creation of a coronavirus advisory board on Monday to get started on his administration’s pandemic response policies. Utah, which has been reporting an average of more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, is one of a number of states in the Great Plains and Mountain West where hospitals are rapidly filling to crisis levels. The Salt Lake Tribune reported on Sunday that 424 Utahns were hospitalized with Covid-19, a record for the state and an increase of nearly 25 percent from a week earlier. In neighboring Idaho, one of the state’s largest hospitals had to turn away patients over the weekend for lack of space, The Idaho Statesman reported. “In my 11 years as governor, I have seen Utahns do remarkable things,” Governor Herbert wrote in his announcement Sunday night. “We have overcome extraordinary challenges and great adversity. I implore you now to do all you can to stop the spread. It is time for Utahns to unite in this response and bring healing back to our state.” — Kaly Soto and

While the pandemic wrecked some businesses, others did fine, and even great. An employee at an Amazon facility in Naples, Italy, in September. The online retailer has seen a huge increase in earnings during the pandemic. Credit... Gianni Cipriano for The New York Times The pandemic has turbocharged profits at some big businesses, like Amazon, which reported a 70 percent increase in earnings in the first nine months of the year. But it has devastated others, like Delta Air Lines, which lost $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Perhaps most surprising: Some companies that had feared for their lives in the spring, among them some rental car businesses, restaurant chains and financial firms, are now doing fine — or even excelling. Wall Street analysts expect earnings to rebound to a record high next year. And, over all, 80 percent of companies in the S&P 500 stock index that have reported third-quarter earnings so far have exceeded analysts’ expectations, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. As the pandemic forced people to stay home and do more things online, some successful companies, like Amazon, were perfectly positioned to take advantage of the change. Now, these businesses are becoming even more dominant. Tech companies were strong before the pandemic downturn — and have powered through the rout, which could help the economy recover faster this time, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities. But the outlook is dire for other businesses. Passenger airlines are among the biggest losers of the pandemic, and they have few options to improve their prospects. Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines worked quickly to cut costs and got $50 billion in the March federal stimulus package. Still, investors are not all that worried, and are signaling that they expect a broad profit recovery among the largest U.S. companies. The S&P 500 has soared nearly 57 percent from its March low and is up 8.6 percent for the year. Those gains may seem odd given that the combined profits of the companies in that index are on track to decline 25 percent this year from a record showing in 2019. But a big chunk of that rally can be attributed to a handful of technology stocks. Of course, many struggling businesses, including lots of restaurants, stores and services companies, are not traded on the stock market. That means a surge in stock prices can give a misleadingly optimistic view of where the economy is headed. — Peter Eavis and

German states are getting ready for vaccine rollout. Health Minister Jens Spahn has said he expects Germany to have access to enough vaccinations to immunize 47 million of its citizens. Credit... Pool photo by Henning Schacht German states are preparing to distribute coronavirus vaccines when they become available by setting up 60 decentralized centers across the country to provide fast and efficient access to doses. “The impact of the pandemic is once again very clear to all of us, and we look forward to the vaccine development with great hope,” said Alena Buyx, the head of Germany’s ethics council, which advises the government, during a news conference on Monday. “Very soon vaccines will be available and many people will ask who will get them first.” The details of the plan came on the same day that Pfizer announced that a vaccine it has been working on with the German drugmaker BioNTech was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the coronavirus among trial volunteers who had no evidence of prior virus infection. Together with a federal standing commission on vaccines and the National Academy of Sciences, the ethics council presented a framework that would prioritize elderly people at high risk, doctors and other caregivers who are often exposed to the disease and those who are in key positions, such as teachers and police officers. “If everyone pulls together now, we will take important steps until next summer to leave this pandemic behind us,” said Gerald Haug, the president of the National Academy of Science. Mr. Haug said that until the vaccines are widely available and administered, people would have to continue to keep to social distancing, mask use and hygiene rules. Jens Spahn, the German health minister, has previously said he expects Germany to have access to enough vaccinations to immunize 47 million of its citizens as the vaccines will require several doses. Initial vaccinations will unlikely be licensed for children or pregnant women. Scientists believe up to 70 percent of a population needs to be immunized for a herd immunity to take effect. In its second week of lockdown, Germany has been registering a record number of new infections. —

France’s latest lockdown is taking a smaller toll on the economy. Commuters wait for a train on the Paris underground last week. France’s latest lockdown is taking less of a toll on the economy than the shutdown imposed earlier this year, the central bank said. Credit... Martin Bureau/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A new partial lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus in France is having a smaller impact on the national economy than a total lockdown earlier this year, the French central bank said Monday. But business leaders still expect a sharp decline in activity across the board in November, as order books at construction companies shrink, the bank added. France’s second lockdown, which began Oct. 17 and is now expected to stretch beyond Dec. 1, was aimed at minimizing damage to the economy just as a recovery was starting to take hold during a summer rebound. Unlike the earlier lockdown, France is allowing public services and schools to stay open, and activity at construction and factory sites to continue. The Banque de France said it expected the economy was likely to show a shrinkage of about 12 percent in November from a year ago. That compares with a wrenching 31 percent year-over-year contraction in April, when economic activity ground to a halt. Whether that improvement lasts remains to be seen. Fears of coronavirus outbreaks have worsened the outlook for French business activity, and are likely to lead to a wave of layoffs, economists say. French companies have said they expect earnings to decline in 2021, and they don’t expect to substantially increase spending on capital investment. Working from home, and the use of socially distanced workplaces has so far helped maintain corporate activity. The opening of schools is easing child care burdens for employees with children. Activity in agro-foods, pharmaceuticals and other industrial sectors enjoyed a bounce after an earlier national quarantine, and are now back to pre-pandemic levels, the central bank added. At the same time, a quarter of the economy remains hard hit by social-distancing measures, including hotels, restaurants, tourism and catering, the central bank said. —

Shanghai reports a coronavirus case. Shanghai managed to avoid a widespread coronavirus outbreak last winter despite being in the same Yangtze River system as Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. Credit... Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images BEIJING — A 51-year-old air cargo worker has been infected with the coronavirus in Shanghai, China’s biggest city, prompting an immediate effort to contain the virus before it can spread. The Shanghai municipal government ordered the immediate quarantine of close contacts of the worker and restricted travel for anyone living in Yingqian, the village within Shanghai where the worker lived. The worker, a man with the surname Wang, went to a hospital with a fever and fatigue on Sunday and tested positive for the virus. Mr. Wang’s four family members and his 16 co-workers have already tested negative for the virus, said Li Guohua, the deputy chief of the city’s huge Pudong district, which includes the airport and Yingqian. The city has quarantined 106 of his close contacts so far and is moving another 75 of them into quarantine, he added. Wu Jinglei, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said at a televised news conference on Monday that the air cargo worker had not been involved in handling frozen food, a category that China has sometimes blamed for previous infections. Mr. Wang also was not connected to the city’s ongoing import expo, which opened on Wednesday. Governments in the West have sometimes struggled to find even three close contacts per infected person. China uses extensive location tracking of cellphones and meticulous interrogation of infected people to assemble far larger lists of contacts to quarantine. Shanghai managed to avoid a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus last winter despite lying in the same Yangtze River system as Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. Shanghai set up checkpoints at municipal borders for many weeks and stringently limited the entry of anyone without legal residency in the city. Qiqing Lin contributed research. —

As W.H.O. virus meeting kicks off, Taiwan is still waiting for its invitation. President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan at a National Day celebration in Taipei, last month. Credit... Ritchie B. Tongo/EPA, via Shutterstock TAIPEI, Taiwan — A virtual meeting of the World Health Organization that will largely focus on the global response to the coronavirus pandemic began Monday, involving representatives from more than 190 countries. Noticeably absent was a place that has won international praise for its success in controlling a virus that has sickened more than 50 million people and killed more than 1.2 million around the world: Taiwan. As of Monday, Taiwan had not yet received an invitation to join the World Health Assembly meeting, which will end on Saturday, according to a spokeswoman for Taiwan’s foreign ministry, despite a multilateral effort led by the United States to support the island’s bid for observer status. The self-governed island, which Beijing claims as its own territory, had observer status until 2016. That changed when Taiwan elected President Tsai Ing-wen, who is loathed by the Chinese Communist Party. Since then, Beijing has repeatedly blocked Taiwan’s efforts to participate in the assembly. Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan’s foreign ministry, said in a statement that excluding Taiwan “not only ignores the health rights of the Taiwanese people, but is also very ironic considering the lofty goal of ‘health for all’ that is outlined in the W.H.O.’s charter.” Since December, Taiwan, which has a population of 23 million, has had only 578 cases and 7 deaths from the virus. The W.H.O. has previously been criticized for its excessive praise of the Chinese government in the early days of the pandemic and for ceding control to China in the crucial search for the animal origin of the coronavirus. Among the agency’s most vocal critics is President Trump, who earlier announced that the United States would withdraw from it. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he would restore U.S. membership in the organization. —"

Will Students Bring Coronavirus Home?,"Tulane University in New Orleans will test undergraduates twice in the last week of class, including those living off-campus. Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., will require students to show a minimum of two negative coronavirus tests on the week before departure. Those who test positive at Tulane will be offered housing and support and “strongly advised” not to travel, according to a school spokesman, while Hamilton has reserved quarantine rooms at a local hotel and plans to work with local health officials to track down any student who refuses to isolate.

And in Massachusetts, where cases have been surging, Boston University has asked students not to leave campus, period, until Dec. 10, when classes end.

Epidemiologists recommend that travelers quarantine themselves before traveling for at least a week and receive one or more negative coronavirus test results within three days of departure. Upon arrival, they should again quarantine until receiving one or more negative test results over three days. Those who do not test should quarantine for 14 days before and after traveling.

Calling universities’ Thanksgiving plans “all over the map,” A. David Paltiel, a professor of health policy and management at the Yale School of Public Health, said colleges should be keeping isolation dorms open for students who test positive just before Thanksgiving.

“There’s a responsibility not to unleash little ticking time bombs,” said Dr. Paltiel, noting that recently exposed students can feel well and still shed large quantities of the virus. “But this has not yet hit the radar screen of many college administrators.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not issued guidance specific to holiday breaks for college students, though it has advised that “travel increases the chance of getting and spreading the virus that causes Covid-19.”

The American College Health Association, which represents college health officers, recently issued public health guidelines recommending that schools encourage students to get tested before their Thanksgiving departure, refrain from traveling if they test positive and quarantine for 14 days at home upon arrival. But the association stopped short of calling for mandatory testing."

It added 35 more police officers, 40 additional ushers and dozens more in event staff and private security guards. Swarbrick asked students to forgo a tradition at the final home game for seniors — throwing marshmallows at one another just before halftime.

And Brian Kelly, the Notre Dame coach, as a way to inspire his players, told them that the fans would storm the field if they won. (The university planned to allow seniors on the field after both teams exited for their locker rooms.)

After the team’s late comeback in the fourth quarter, students moved down and crowded close to the field as overtime began. As the energy in the stadium built, Swarbrick said a tactical decision was made to not have the security, which was meant to keep students from rushing the field, push back out of fear that students might be crushed.

Mark Fox, the county’s deputy health director, who since August has advised the university’s approach to the pandemic, watched students pour over the wall from a perch near the top of the stadium. He could not recall any public-address warnings until after they were on the field.

“I was sick to my stomach,” Fox said. “I felt really ineffective as a public health person. I felt like I was wringing my hands and asking the woulda, shoulda, coulda questions, and that’s an uncomfortable place to be.”

He added: “If you’re confident going in and anticipating a win, this should have been part of the anticipation package. We talked about how the messaging could have been better. Having riot police might have been the only thing we could have done to keep them off the field. In hindsight, is there anything that could have been or should have been done? Yeah, probably so.”

The Sunday morning quarterbacking from Jenkins was not directed inward.

In a letter to students on Sunday night, he called their “widespread disregard” of health protocols at many gatherings over the weekend “very disappointing.” (A spokesman said Jenkins was referring not to the football game — where nearly two-thirds of the student body was — but to other parties.) Jenkins announced that students would not be allowed to graduate or register for classes next semester if they failed to take upcoming virus tests scheduled to begin Thursday, or if they left South Bend before getting their results."

The phrases refer to going deep inside the computer networks of adversaries, whether that means the Internet Research Agency, the Russia-based group that mounted the 2016 influence campaigns; the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence agency; or Iran’s increasingly active cybercorps.

Once inside, Cyber Command can use its access to hunt for operations that are being planned — or to conduct what amount to pre-emptive strikes.

The United States has launched such strikes before, of course, against Iran’s nuclear program, North Korea’s missiles and, during the 2018 elections, the Internet Research Agency, which ran the influence campaign that aided Mr. Trump in 2016. But there was no significant cyberretaliation, at least that became public, ordered by the Obama administration surrounding the 2016 election, even though the administration knew that Russian actors were stealing data and scanning voter registration systems.

This time General Nakasone did not wait for much evidence to roll in before acting.

He went after Trickbot, a widely used set of tools written by Russian-speaking criminal groups that he believed could be used to lock up registration systems or computer sites of secretaries of state, which count ballots.

So did Microsoft, which obtained court orders against Trickbot. Together, the military and private sector actions, which appear to have been largely uncoordinated, disrupted the network of the criminal groups in October, leaving them hampered in any potential attacks against election infrastructure.

Officials familiar with the operations say there were also attacks directed at a Russian state-run group called Energetic Bear, or Dragonfly, that has long been inside American electric utilities and has redirected its hacking skills toward state and local governments.

Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who helped lead a bipartisan effort to draw lessons from the rising tempo of cyberattacks, said Cyber Command’s more active approach had an effect."

But on Monday, Ella A. Pamfilova, the head of Russia’s Central Election Commission, took her turn at sounding off on the superiority of Russian governance. She said she had studied mail-in voting and decided against using it in Russia because it was too vulnerable to cheating.

“This anachronism in its American version opens up boundless possibilities for potential fraud,” she told Tass, a state-run Russian news agency — echoing one of Mr. Trump’s favorite claims, though no evidence of such fraud has emerged. “It turns out I was right. What’s going on now in the United States is the best illustration of that.”

The Kremlin may well miss Mr. Trump. While the president never delivered on Russian hopes of rapprochement between Washington and Moscow, his America-first foreign policy dovetailed with the Kremlin’s desire to weaken the Western alliance and to expand Russian influence around the world.

Mr. Biden, by contrast, has vowed to take a tougher line on Russia and to rebuild ties with America’s traditional allies. Some Russian analysts have noted potential silver linings to a Biden presidency, including a greater potential to work with Washington on matters of common interest like arms control and Iran’s nuclear program. But that optimistic narrative has been far from front-and-center on Russian state media in the last week.

For China, the calculus is even more complicated, and state media’s response to Mr. Biden’s win has been more measured. Mr. Biden would be “more moderate and mature” than Mr. Trump on foreign affairs, Global Times, a fiercely nationalistic tabloid, said. Still, the president-elect seems determined to leave in place many of Mr. Trump’s harshest measures, and China’s leaders appear to have concluded that the United States will remain irreconcilably opposed to the country’s rise.

Southern Daily, an official newspaper for the southern province of Guangdong, said that while Mr. Biden would most likely treat Russia, not China, as the biggest foreign threat to the United States, “we don’t have to have illusions.”"

Nov. 9, 2020, 8:40 p.m. ET Nov. 9, 2020, 8:40 p.m. ET By Nicole Perlroth and No, Software Glitches Are Not Affecting Vote Counts President Trump and many of his supporters complained over the weekend that “software glitches” undermined the vote counts in Michigan and Georgia and argued that the problems portended wider issues in other counties and states that used the same software. But issues in the unofficial vote counts in Michigan’s Antrim and Oakland counties were caused by human error, not software glitches, according to reviews by the Michigan Department of State, county clerks and election security experts. Officials concluded that they were isolated cases that did not signal wider issues with vote counts elsewhere. And in Georgia, software issues only affected how poll workers checked-in voters in two counties and delayed the reporting of results in another. The issues did not affect the counts. “Anyone trying to falsely connect the situations in the two states is spreading misinformation in an effort to undermine the integrity of our elections system,” said Tracy Wimmer, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of State. In Antrim County, Mich., a Republican stronghold, unofficial results initially showed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. beating Mr. Trump by roughly 3,000 votes — a sharp reversal from Mr. Trump's performance there in 2016. Local officials caught and fixed the error. In the revised count, Mr. Trump beat Mr. Biden by roughly 2,500 votes. The problem, election security experts and state officials concluded, was that an election worker had configured ballot scanners and reporting systems with slightly different versions of the ballot, which meant some results did not line up with the right candidate when officials loaded them into the system.



In Oakland County, Mich., the result of one local race was changed after election officials spotted an error in the unofficial counts. The first tally said an incumbent Republican county commissioner had lost his seat, but the corrected tallies showed he kept it. County election workers had mistakenly counted votes from the city of Rochester Hills, Mich., twice, according to the Michigan Department of State. The workers later spotted the error. “As a Republican, I am disturbed that this is intentionally being mischaracterized to undermine the election process,” Tina Barton, the clerk in Rochester Hills, said in a video she posted online. “This was an isolated mistake that was quickly rectified.” As the City Clerk of the City of Rochester Hills, this is my response to the inaccurate statement of @GOPChairwoman. https://t.co/TdxyIvEZ2J pic.twitter.com/t5C1VvGR01 — Tina Barton (@TLBsStory) November 7, 2020 Michigan officials added that the errors came in the counties’ unofficial tallies and that they were fixed before another layer of checks that is designed to catch such mistakes. In that review, two Republican and two Democratic “canvassers” certify the vote counts in each county, checking poll books, ballot summaries and tabulator tapes. Both counties relied on election-management software made by Dominion Voting Systems. That led conservative publications like Breitbart and The Federalist to falsely suggest that the mistakes were with Dominion and could mean wider issues in Michigan and in Georgia, where counties that used similar Dominion software experienced hiccups. In Georgia, only one of three counties that had problems, Gwinnett County, tied the issues to Dominion, said Harri Hursti, an election security expert on the ground in Georgia. Those issues delayed the reporting of vote counts but did not affect the tallies. The other two, Spalding and Morgan counties, had issues with the systems that check-in voters at the polls. Those so-called Poll Pads were made by a company called KnowInk. “People are comparing apples to oranges in the name of Dominion,” Mr. Hursti said. “This was a glitch in the way that KnowInk Poll Pads interacted with ballot-marking devices, not with Dominion, period.” Yet Twitter and Facebook posts from President Trump and Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, suggested the issues in Michigan and Georgia illustrated much wider problems about the election. Since Friday, there were more than 3,700 Facebook posts that mentioned “election,” “software” and “glitch,” and they were collectively shared more than 250,000 times. Right-wing news sites echoed those complaints. Image Two Republican senators from Georgia, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, citing what they said were “failures” in Georgia’s elections process, called on Brad Raffensperger, the state’s Republican secretary of state, to resign on Monday. Mr. Raffensperger later responded, “That is not going to happen.” The Michigan Department of State said the fact that election workers caught the issues with the counts showed the system of checks worked. “Municipal and county clerks are dedicated public servants who work hard and with integrity,” the department said in a statement. “Sometimes they make honest mistakes, and when they do there are many checks and balances in the election system to ensure they can be identified and corrected.” Ben Decker contributed research.

Nov. 9, 2020, 7:44 p.m. ET Nov. 9, 2020, 7:44 p.m. ET By Facebook Removes Pages Linked to Bannon for Pushing Misinformation Stephen K. Bannon, center, after his arrest on fraud charges in August. On Monday, Facebook said it had removed a network of Stop the Steal pages affiliated with Mr. Bannon. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Facebook said on Monday that it had removed a network of pages affiliated with the former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon that worked together to push false information about the presidential election. The company said it had removed seven pages associated with the Stop the Steal hashtag, a reference to conservatives’ unfounded accusations that Democrats stole last week’s election. The pages had amassed a following of roughly 2.5 million people. “We’ve removed several clusters of activity for using inauthentic behavior tactics to artificially boost how many people saw their content,” said Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman. “That includes a group that was originally named Stop the Steal, which later became Gay Communists for Socialism and misled people about its purpose using deceptive tactics.” The move is the latest example of Facebook’s wide-ranging crackdown on misinformation about the election. In recent weeks, the company has removed more types of content and taken more steps to clamp down on falsehoods, though it has said the measures are temporary and focused on the period around the election. Conservatives, emulating statements from President Trump, have used the Stop the Steal idea to form groups and coordinate protests across the internet. On Thursday, Facebook took down the largest Stop the Steal Facebook group, which had attracted more than 320,000 followers in less than 24 hours. But other groups popped up. Facebook took action on them late last week after Avaaz, a progressive nonprofit that monitors digital disinformation, contacted the social network about their proliferation. Some of the pages were linked to Mr. Bannon’s page on Facebook, the company said. It has temporarily halted some of his Facebook permissions, including the ability to create posts, but his account has been allowed to remain on the site. The Washington Post earlier reported the action by Facebook. A spokesperson for Mr. Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The moves did not go as far as one by Twitter, which suspended an account belonging to Mr. Bannon on Thursday after he posted a video suggesting that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious-disease expert, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, should be beheaded. Mr. Bannon made the comments during a livestream of his show, “War Room: Pandemic.” “The @WarRoomPandemic account has been permanently suspended for violating the Twitter Rules, specifically our policy on the glorification of violence,” a Twitter spokesman said at the time. Mr. Bannon, 66, lost his job at the White House eight months after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. In August, he was arrested on charges of defrauding donors to a campaign to privately fund a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, one of Mr. Trump’s signature political promises. Kate Conger contributed reporting. Correction : Nov. 9, 2020 An earlier version of this article misstated when Facebook removed pages linked to Stephen K. Bannon. It acted late last week, not on Monday, when it confirmed the removals. Read more

Nov. 6, 2020, 8:11 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 8:11 p.m. ET By No, 21,000 Dead People in Pennsylvania Did Not Vote On Friday, a viral claim that Pennsylvania had 21,000 dead people on its voter rolls spread across the internet. In some versions of the rumor, those deceased people had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Breitbart News, the right-wing publication, wrote an article about it. Others then cited it as evidence that Democrats were trying to steal the election. Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, shared the article on Twitter, collecting 74,800 likes and shares. Diamond and Silk, the popular pro-Trump social media duo, posted about the rumor on Facebook. And Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, tweeted: “The dead vote appears to have swung overwhelmingly for Joe Biden.” Altogether, Facebook posts about the rumor reached up to 11.3 million people, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The problem: It wasn’t true that 21,000 dead people had voted in Pennsylvania. The claim stemmed from a lawsuit that was amended on Thursday, an action that fueled the rumor’s spread on Friday. The conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation had filed the lawsuit against Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, on Oct. 15 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The suit accuses Ms. Boockvar, a Democrat, of improperly including 21,206 supposedly deceased Pennsylvanians on voter rolls. The group asked for an injunction to stop the dead people from voting in the election. On Oct. 20, the court’s chief judge, John E. Jones III, who has the case, said he was doubtful of the suit. He noted in a ruling that the Public Interest Legal Foundation was asking the court to accept its findings that dead people were on the voter rolls but said, “We cannot and will not take plaintiff’s word for it — in an election where every vote matters, we will not disenfranchise potentially eligible voters based solely upon the allegations of a private foundation.” Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for the legal foundation, said in an email on Friday it had evidence from the 2016 and 2018 elections for its suit. “Evidence and exhibits are filed under seal with the court,” he said. “The lawsuit is not a rumor, and the methodology is explained in the amended complaint, filed yesterday.” A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office said: “The court found no deficiency in how Pennsylvania maintains its voter rolls. There is currently no proof provided that any deceased person has voted in the 2020 election.” Ms. Boockvar’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Dead people whose identities were used to vote appear to be a popular subject for those who are spreading unsubstantiated claims of fraud about the election. Assertions that the dead had voted in Michigan also surfaced on Twitter and other social media this week. But The Times found that the Michigan voters were alive and had voted legally, and that in some cases their birth dates had shown up inaccurately because of clerical errors. Read more

Wednesday 4:56 p.m. Wed. “.....there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported!” Thursday Friday Twitter flagged half of President Trump’s 14 posts on Thursday for including disputed or misleading information, as the company takes a far more aggressive approach to battling misinformation on its platform. In the hours and days after the election, the president repeatedly lashed out about vote counting and lobbed unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. Through Friday afternoon, Twitter labeled 15 of the 44 tweets and retweets Mr. Trump posted since the first polls closed on Election Day, according to a New York Times analysis. Before the election, the company had flagged only a handful of his tweets for violating policies against the glorification of violence and misinformation about the civic process. In the early hours of Friday, Mr. Trump fired back, referring to a law that provides a legal safe harbor to Twitter and other social media companies. Twitter is out of control, made possible through the government gift of Section 230! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2020 For months, Twitter has been locked in a fight with the president over what he can and cannot tweet. In May, the company began adding fact-checks and labels to his posts as a way to demonstrate that Mr. Trump had broken its policies. (Twitter does not require world leaders to delete tweets that break its rules, as it does regular users.) Mr. Trump responded by signing an executive order intended to chip away at the protections of Section 230, which is part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Twitter has broken ranks with other social media companies in its persistent effort to moderate the president. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has said he has no desire to fact-check Mr. Trump. Facebook said it would caution users about premature claims of victory with a notification that the election had yet to be called, and took action on some of Mr. Trump’s posts in which he claimed the election was being stolen. The battle between Twitter and Mr. Trump has become a round-the-clock event since the election, as the president has increasingly, without evidence, questioned the voting process and the results. Twitter’s labeling of Mr. Trump’s tweets meant that people needed to click through their warnings to see the posts, making each one harder to share. In the past, those actions by Twitter have helped slow the overall spread of false or potentially misleading tweets, according to an analysis by the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of misinformation researchers. The Trump campaign said Twitter was working to “silence the president.” A Twitter spokesman said the company planned to continue to take action against tweets that prematurely declared victory or contained misleading information. Members of Mr. Trump’s family and staff have also tested Twitter’s boundaries, forcing the company to keep pace as they claimed that he had won the vote in Pennsylvania, a race that had yet to be called by Friday afternoon. And as key states appeared to tip in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr., Twitter also added labels to tweets from Democrats who pre-emptively claimed Mr. Biden had won the presidency. With votes still being counted, Twitter’s challenge isn’t over. And even when a winner is declared, Twitter may continue its effort to moderate Mr. Trump. He has indicated that he plans to contest the election results if he is not declared the winner, and is likely to take to Twitter to air his grievances. Read more

Nov. 6, 2020, 2:34 p.m. ET Nov. 6, 2020, 2:34 p.m. ET By Study Considers a Link Between QAnon and Polling Errors Research is finding a strong correlation between state polls that underestimated President Trump’s chances and a higher-than-average volume of QAnon activity in those states. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Polls in several key states underestimated the breadth of support for President Trump before the Nov. 3 election, just as they did in 2016. But why? Early results from a study by researchers at the University of Southern California indicate that pollsters may not have captured support for Mr. Trump among followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory that has spread widely on Twitter and other social networks in recent months. The researchers identified a strong statistical correlation between state polls that underestimated Mr. Trump’s chances and a higher-than-average volume of QAnon activity in those states, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio. “The higher the support for QAnon in each state, the more the polls underestimated the support for Trump,” said Emilio Ferrara, the University of Southern California professor who is overseeing the study. The study draws on an analysis of more than 240 million election-related tweets from June through September, which included widespread activity involving QAnon, a conspiracy theory that falsely claims that President Trump is facing down a shadowy cabal of Democratic pedophiles. The researchers then compared this data to election predictions made by the popular website FiveThirtyEight.com. Mr. Ferrara suggests that QAnon believers were not properly captured by the polls because such conspiracy theorists tend to distrust mainstream media organizations like FiveThirtyEight or The New York Times. “If you distrust institutions,” he said, “you are less likely to participate in polls.” Participants are typically recruited by phone and in online surveys. Joshua Dyck, an associate professor of political science and director of the Center for Public Opinion at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, said we still do not have a full picture of how well the polls performed, because many votes are still being counted. But he also said the hypothesis laid down by Dr. Ferrara and his colleagues was entirely plausible, pointing out that such distrust for mainstream media is well documented. “This is something we can measure and actually adjust for in our surveys,” he said. Among people who said they “hardly ever” trusted the mainstream media, 78 percent were Trump supporters and only 17 percent supported Mr. Biden, according to a recent nationwide poll by Dr. Dyck and the Center for Public Opinion. Dr. Dyck said that significant polling errors in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio may also be related to the coronavirus pandemic. Voters who supported Mr. Biden were more likely to stay at home during the pandemic, which, he said, meant they had more time to respond to polls, either by phone or online. “Because the pandemic is a politicized issue, the polls may be undercounting Trump supporters,” Dr. Dyck said. He also said that polling errors could involve all these groups. “The QAnon hypothesis is reasonable. And the Covid hypothesis is reasonable. And they may overlap,” he said. “We may be talking about the same people.” Read more

Nov. 5, 2020, 5:33 p.m. ET Nov. 5, 2020, 5:33 p.m. ET By Twitter Has Labeled 38% of Trump’s Tweets Since Tuesday [Read more on Joe Biden’s president-elect acceptance speech.] Throughout his term, President Trump has relied on Twitter to be his bullhorn. But since early Tuesday morning, the company has stepped up its effort to fact-check the president, labeling 38 percent of his 29 tweets and retweets (not 39 percent, as reported here earlier) with warnings that said he made misleading claims about the electoral process, according to a tally by The New York Times. In September, Twitter said it would take aggressive action on tweets that misled readers about the voting process, discouraged people from voting, or pre-emptively declared victory for a candidate. So far, Twitter’s enforcement actions have focused on the president and people in his immediate circle, like family members and staff members. Although the president’s Twitter usage was fairly subdued on Tuesday, he quickly escalated his volume and rhetoric in the early hours of Wednesday. He continued on Thursday, using Twitter to make unfounded claims about election fraud and to imply that he had won the races in states where no victor had been confirmed. Image Twitter added labels to 11 of Mr. Trump’s tweets or retweets (although one tweet that Mr. Trump had shared was later deleted by its author). Most of the labels said Mr. Trump had shared content that was “disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.” But one tweet, in which Mr. Trump preemptively claimed to have won Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, was marked with a small reminder that those races had not yet been called. “Big tech interfered against President Trump before Election Day, and they are now continuing that interference in the days after as they silence the president on their platforms,” said Samantha Zager, the deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign. “The American people deserve to know what is happening with this election, but big tech is only interested in stopping the flow of information to voters.” A Twitter spokesman said the company planned to continue to take action against tweets that prematurely declare victory or contain misleading information.

Credit... Brittany Greeson for The New York Times Protesters who stormed a vote-counting site in Detroit on Wednesday, banging on windows and shouting “Stop the count!” appear to have had one thing in common: They organized themselves online. A New York Times analysis found 32 public and private Facebook groups with a total of 301,000 followers organized an “urgent call to action in Detroit,” asking Republican poll challengers to watch the vote counting at the downtown site, TCF Center. The call was also shared on less popular social networks like Parler and the pro-Trump website TheDonald.win. The earliest call for additional Republican poll challengers was posted to Facebook at 7:27 a.m., according to The Times’s analysis. “Come to TCF Center,” read the post in a group called Michigan for Donald Trump. “Help needed to protect our lead. Tell others.” By around 3 p.m., there were dozens of calls posted on Facebook, and people responded by showing up; over 100 people were at the vote-counting site by then. NBC News earlier reported on a private Facebook group, Stand Up Michigan to Unlock Michigan, that was part of the calls; Facebook removed the group shortly after. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After the protesters arrived, workers began to cover the site’s windows, leading to unfounded rumors about their motivations. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, shared one such video, and captioned her post, “SHADY …” It collected 62,000 likes and shares on Twitter, and 7.3 million video views. On Wednesday evening, President Trump tweeted about the falsehood, generating more than 350,000 likes and shares. Image Lawrence Garcia, the city of Detroit’s corporation counsel, said the windows had been covered because poll workers inside had expressed concerns about people taking unauthorized photographs and videos of their work. “Only the media is allowed to take pictures inside the counting place,” he said, “and people outside the center were not listening to requests to stop filming poll workers and their paperwork.” Jake Rollow, the communications director for the Michigan Department of State, vehemently opposed the misleading narrative. “Michigan’s absentee ballot counting processes are meticulous, fair and transparent,” he said. “The bipartisan boards of county and state canvassers will review the processes and results in the coming 12 days.” Read more

Credit... Bryan Denton for The New York Times Early Wednesday, images of an election map suggested that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had suddenly received 138,339 votes in Michigan, or 100 percent of the newly counted ballots in an update of the state’s tally. The images quickly set off claims of election fraud across social media, amplified by President Trump, who shared them on Twitter with the caption: “WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?” WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? https://t.co/6487pYLZnL — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020 In reality, Mr. Biden didn’t receive those votes. They were briefly added to his unofficial totals on an election map because of a typo in a small Michigan county that was caught and corrected in roughly half an hour. “All it was is there was an extra zero that got typed in,” said Abigail Bowen, the elections clerk in Shiawassee County in Michigan, just northwest of Detroit. “It was caught quickly,” she added. “That’s why we have these checks and balances.” When Ms. Bowen and her team sent the county’s unofficial vote counts to Michigan officials early Wednesday, they accidentally reported Mr. Biden’s tally as 153,710, when it should have been 15,371, she said. About 20 minutes later, she said a state elections official called her to ask if the number was a typo; Shiawassee County doesn’t even have that many residents. Ms. Bowen said she corrected the figure and the number was updated. “All of these numbers are unofficial, so even if it wouldn’t have been caught last night, it absolutely would have been caught before we would have submitted our official results,” she said. A team of two Republican and two Democratic canvassers review all of the county’s poll books, ballot summaries and tabulator tapes to confirm the results before they are finalized, she said. “As far as Shiawassee County, I feel the election went very well,” she said. Yet on social media, the county represented a stark example of voter fraud. Posts that highlighted the apparent sudden boost in Mr. Biden’s count in Michigan were shared more than 100,000 times, and conservative websites posted stories with headlines like: “Very Odd: Michigan Found Over 100,000 Ballots and Every Single One Has Joe Biden’s Name on It.” Matt Mackowiak, a Texas Republican consultant, posted the screenshots of the election map on Twitter and watched them quickly go viral, eventually shared by the president himself. Twitter eventually labeled Mr. Mackowiak’s post as disputed or misleading, and the company stopped people from sharing it as easily. Mr. Mackowiak said in an interview that after posting the screenshots, he saw other Twitter posts suggesting the data was the result of a typo. He deleted his original tweet and posted a correction. “I certainly wasn’t intending to make a typo appear fraudulent,” he said. “It didn’t occur to me that it could be a typo, but of course we’re all going on very little sleep.” This tweet was taken and share honestly. I have now learned the MI update referenced was a typo in one county.



I have deleted the original tweet. pic.twitter.com/NXQINWDbEH — Matt Mackowiak (@MattMackowiak) November 4, 2020 Yet his correction was read by a small fraction of the people that his initial post had reached, and thousands of people continued to cite his images as evidence of a stolen election hours later. He said that he wished Twitter could help his correction reach all the people who saw his original post, but that is not an option on the site. Mr. Mackowiak said that he didn’t think that he had shared misinformation, because the election maps were indeed wrong for a moment, but he added that he also didn’t think the election was being stolen. “I haven’t seen a lot of reasons to doubt the integrity of the election,” he said. Mr. Mackowiak took the screenshots from an election map by Decision Desk HQ, an election-data provider. Posts from the company on Twitter showed that it removed the votes from Mr. Biden’s count by 5:45 a.m. Michigan time on Thursday, shortly after they were added. “We accurately reported what was provided at the time by election officials. When corrected data was available, we reported that,” said Drew McCoy, Decision Desk’s president. He said there were layers of security to ensure that the final counts were accurate. “This is a complex and large endeavor, reporting on a national election with thousands of races and thousands of counties,” he said. This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data,.

Here are three types that are making the rounds on social media. 1. False claims of ballots being found or lost Image As the vote count got underway, unproven claims of ballots being found or lost — falsely held up as evidence of widespread voter fraud — began to emerge on Facebook and Twitter. Renee DiResta, a disinformation researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said these posts “repurposed user-created content from Election Day, which documented one-off incidents” then aggregated them “to support claims of fraud and illegitimacy.” This type of post sometimes used pictures to lend an air of legitimacy to the false claim. On Tuesday evening, for example, a Twitter user commented on a news article with photos showing election workers in Fairfax County, Va., carrying sealed ballot boxes. The caption falsely stated that the batch of ballots had been found “once Virginia was looking red.” Twitter labeled the post with a notice that let people “learn about U.S. 2020 election security efforts.” 2. False rumors of vote counts jumping in swing states Image Another common type of misleading post: that fraudulent votes were added in swing states overnight, leading to a suspicious jump in vote counts, mostly for the Democratic presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Posts reviewed by The New York Times included specific mentions of Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia. In reality, there is nothing out of the ordinary about this process. “Processes for state elections were determined long before the first ballot was cast,” said Lisa Kaplan, the founder of Alethea Group, a company that helps fight election-related misinformation. “It’s normal to see vote count change as states follow the procedures that they determined from the outset.” “While allegations of voter fraud should be taken seriously, those allegations are rare,” Ms. Kaplan said. “Any such claim should be taken seriously and matched with facts and evidence.” 3. Falsehoods about Sharpie markers messing up vote counts Image A baseless narrative alleging that Arizona poll workers gave voters Sharpies to mark their ballots so their votes would be invalidated received more than 36,000 mentions across cable television and social media on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to an analysis by Zignal Labs, a media insights company. Individual tweets were posted beginning on the morning of Nov. 3, according to Zignal’s data, then rose sharply after midnight on Nov. 4. Many of the posts viewed by The Times mentioned Maricopa County and Pinal County in Arizona, among other places, and raised fears about votes not being properly counted because of the way voting machines read ballots with marker ink bleeding through the paper. But both Arizona counties quickly debunked the idea of this being systemic voter fraud. Pinal County said people did not hand out Sharpies at polling places, and Maricopa County said using a Sharpie was safe for ballots there. Facebook said it had blocked the hashtag #Sharpiegate by early Wednesday afternoon, meaning it is not searchable on its platform. Read more

Nov. 4, 2020, 4:08 p.m. ET Nov. 4, 2020, 4:08 p.m. ET By Kellen Browning, Ben Decker and Twitter Clamped Down on Trump, but Army of Accounts Spread His Message President Trump spoke in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Hours before President Trump falsely claimed to supporters at the White House early on Wednesday that he had already won the presidential election, he prefaced his argument with a tweet. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election,” he wrote. Twitter clamped down on the statement, which lacked evidence, in about five minutes. The social media platform added a label saying the tweet contained disputed or misleading information, and largely blocked users from replying, liking or sharing it. But that didn’t stop more than 750 other Twitter accounts from trying to amplify Mr. Trump’s claims with the exact same message. “Everyone must tweet what @realDonaldTrump did before getting suppressed by Twitter,” all of the accounts posted, before sharing Mr. Trump’s message verbatim. The accounts, which had at least 1.5 million combined followers, copied Mr. Trump’s claim into more than 1,000 of their own tweets that collectively accumulated 9,000 retweets and quote tweets over a 7.5-hour time period Wednesday morning, according to a New York Times analysis. Image Twitter moved quickly to hide Mr. Trump’s tweet behind a label cautioning people that his election claim was “disputed.” Some of those who amplified Mr. Trump’s false assertion were established right-wing personalities with hundreds of thousands of followers, like Raheem Kassam, the British political activist and editor in chief of The National Pulse, a conservative news site. But many of the accounts were far smaller: The median account had just 342 followers, and some had zero. More than 150 were created in 2020, according to The Times analysis. The accounts tweeted in English, Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish and Arabic, and about 50 accounts that featured Brazilian flag emojis in their user name or user biography appeared to be supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s populist president, according to the analysis. Isabella Garcia-Camargo, an organizer of the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of misinformation researchers, said on a call with reporters on Wednesday that although accounts with large followings that shared Mr. Trump’s message were labeled and restricted by Twitter, some of the smaller accounts “didn’t get that action.” A Twitter spokesman said the company took “quick action” to limit engagement on tweets that violated its policies, and continues to monitor tweets “that attempt to spread misleading information about voting, accounts engaged in spammy behavior and tweets that make premature or inaccurate claims about election results.” Twitter said tweets that copied Mr. Trump’s message would receive warning labels, but it would take some time for all of them to be discovered. Lisa Kaplan, the founder of Alethea Group, a company that helps public officials and private clients fight misinformation, said the copy-paste method was a common strategy. “Sophisticated actors have shown they’re flexible when it comes to circumventing automated detection by platforms,” she said. “There is a lot of gray space outlined in the community standards — meaning disinformation efforts continue to occur.” Mr. Trump posted an identical statement on Facebook on Tuesday night, which remained shareable and had received 59,000 comments and 23,000 shares as of Wednesday morning. Facebook added a label noting that “final results may be different from initial vote counts,” which a spokesman said was consistent with its policies about declaring a premature election victory.

Nov. 4, 2020, 3:00 p.m. ET Nov. 4, 2020, 3:00 p.m. ET By No, Sharpies Aren’t Invalidating Ballots in Arizona Voters waiting in line on Tuesday to cast their ballots at the Paradise Valley Community College in Maricopa County. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times On Wednesday, Republicans looking to cast doubts on the legitimacy of election results in Arizona, where former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was running ahead of President Trump, began circulating a conspiracy theory about the use of felt-tip pens at the state’s polling stations. The viral rumor, which was shared by one of Mr. Trump’s sons, Eric, and other prominent Republicans, including some who called it “Sharpiegate,” alleged that poll workers had provided Trump voters with felt-tip pens to mark their ballots, which some claimed invalidated those ballots by making them unreadable by voting machines. But Arizona officials said that there was no truth to that claim and that votes recorded with felt-tip pens would still be counted. “Those ballots are being counted,” Arizona’s secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, said in a local TV interview on Thursday. Ms. Hobbs said that officials in Maricopa County, the state’s largest county, had deliberately offset the columns on their ballots to prevent misreadings from a mark bleeding through to the opposite side of the page. And she said that the state’s election authorities had processes in place to ensure that ballots with stray marks would be counted. Maricopa County officials also said that voters were given fine-tip markers at polling places not to invalidate their votes, but because “they have the fastest drying ink, therefore preventing smudges when put through the Vote Center tabulation equipment.” Officials in Pinal and Pima counties also refuted the claims, saying that the state’s tabulating machines can read ballots marked with felt-tip pens. “No ballots will be discarded because of the method used to color in the ovals,” Pima County’s official Twitter account said. In response to stories circulating regarding Sharpie markers in Arizona, Pinal County DOES NOT provide Sharpies at Polling Places.

Nov. 4, 2020, 11:50 a.m. ET Nov. 4, 2020, 11:50 a.m. ET By Davey Alba and Unclear Result a Recipe for Disinformation, Researchers Say Patrons watch returns on election night in the parking lot of Manuel’s Tavern in Atlanta. Credit... Audra Melton for The New York Times The worst-case scenario for the proliferation of misinformation about the election is playing out, disinformation researchers said Wednesday morning. The presidential race is extremely close, it could take days to get final results, and President Trump has falsely declared his own victory early — leaving a gray zone with a huge information gap that is ripe for exploitation. “Many are still glued to social media streams hoping to glean any new information, which makes them likely to encounter misinformation,” said Joan Donovan, the research director at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. The range of Election Day misinformation was pretty much what the social networking companies expected, said two Facebook employees who work on the company’s election team and one Twitter employee. Foreign disinformation actors were largely booted off the major social networks, leaving the Russians and others to work for crumbs of engagement on less popular online forums like Gab and Parler, said the employees, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. But Wednesday and the ensuing days will probably be much more chaotic if the race remains too close to call, they said. In particular, misinformation researchers and the Facebook and Twitter employees said they were concerned that candidates and their advisers would start to share misleading information and distorted narratives, or continue to call the election prematurely. Some of this began to play out on Wednesday morning. Twitter applied a label to a post by Ben Wikler, head of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, which asserted prematurely that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won in the state. “Some votes may still need to be counted,” Twitter’s label reads. The company also limited users’ ability to like and share the post. Green Bay and Kenosha results are in. Biden is now up in Wisconsin by roughly 20,600 votes. That number could wobble a bit, but there's no realistic path for Trump to pull ahead.



Biden has won more votes any prez candidate in WI history.



Folks: Joe Biden just won Wisconsin. https://t.co/xtg0hiSlW4 — Ben Wikler (@benwikler) November 4, 2020 “As votes are still being counted across the country, our teams continue to take enforcement action on tweets that prematurely declare victory or contain misleading information about the election broadly,” Trenton Kennedy, a Twitter spokesman, said in a statement. “This is in line with our Civic Integrity Policy and our recent guidance on labeling election results.” But even more worrisome than posts sharing misleading information is the erosion of the public’s trust in the democratic process beyond this specific election, said Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation analyst at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think thank. “In countries I’ve worked in where there is a history — and evidence — of voter fraud, citizens’ distrust in the democratic process lingers long even after several cycles of clean, well-run elections,” Ms. Jankowicz said. “We need our political leaders to step up right now and assure voters that all votes will be counted.” Ms. Jankowicz suggested that people look at official sources of information like state and local election boards, and tune out politicians and pundits for now. If posts provoke an emotional response, she said, there is a good a chance it was from people trying to be emotionally manipulative. And Melissa Ryan, chief executive of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation, advised: “If something you see online seems too good — or too terrible — to be true, take extra care to verify it. Don’t share anything online that you can’t personally verify.” Read more

Nov. 3, 2020, 10:48 p.m. ET Nov. 3, 2020, 10:48 p.m. ET By Posts About Pennsylvania Get Most Misinformation on Election Day [After warnings it could go off the rails, the election actually ran smoothly.] Pennsylvania saw more misinformation on Election Day, especially around allegations of fraud or election stealing, than other states before the polls closed, according to misinformation researchers. Zignal Labs, a media insights company, tracked keywords related to “steal” or “stealing” the election during the first 18½ hours of Tuesday. The keywords were mentioned together with Pennsylvania at a rate 6.4 times higher than the next-highest state, Kansas (which was followed by Texas, Michigan and Florida), the company found. During that period, Zignal found that keywords related to “stealing” and the election hit 119,000 mentions across cable television, social media, and print and online news outlets. One viral hashtag in particular, #StopTheSteal, made the mentions spike from a few dozen to over 2,000 in 15 minutes on Tuesday morning, researchers found. It was mentioned over 12,800 times on Twitter by noon. Within this set of mentions, Pennsylvania saw 8,150 related to Democrats stealing the election, buoyed by articles published on right-wing outlets such as The Gateway Pundit and National Post. Notable figures like Mike Roman, the Trump campaign’s director of Election Day operations, also pushed mentions up. “ILLEGAL campaigning INSIDE of a polling location in Philly,” Mr. Roman said in a post that was shared 13,200 times on Twitter. “Man in blue is handing out DEM literature to voters IN LINE TO VOTE.” An analysis by The New York Times’s Visual Investigations unit found that the two photos Mr. Roman shared did not appear to match. Twitter labeled the tweet “misleading” and later “manipulated,” and a spokeswoman said the company had labeled the tweet and several others by Mr. Roman under its Civic Integrity Policy. A separate analysis by Zignal showed that Pennsylvania was the subject of more likely voting misinformation than other states on Tuesday, too. Of around 15,000 voting misinformation mentions from midnight to 7 p.m., 3,449 were tied to Pennsylvania, which was followed by Michigan, Florida, Washington and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is one of the largest battleground states. Read more"

New Research Says Yes","The question has lingered around the edges of the pop-culture ascendancy of Alexander Hamilton: Did the 10-dollar founding father, celebrated in the musical “Hamilton” as a “revolutionary manumission abolitionist,” actually own slaves?

Some biographers have gingerly addressed the matter over the years, often in footnotes or passing references. But a new research paper released by the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site in Albany, N.Y., offers the most ringing case yet.

In the paper, titled “‘As Odious and Immoral a Thing’: Alexander Hamilton’s Hidden History as an Enslaver,” Jessie Serfilippi, a historical interpreter at the mansion, examines letters, account books and other documents. Her conclusion — about Hamilton, and what she suggests is wishful thinking on the part of many of his modern-day admirers — is blunt.

“Not only did Alexander Hamilton enslave people, but his involvement in the institution of slavery was essential to his identity, both personally and professionally,” she writes."

France and Italy are enduring record outbreaks and locking down regions. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

10 million Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. A health care worker performs a coronavirus test at in Milwaukee. Wisconsin has been among the hardest hit states in recent weeks. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times The United States reported its 10 millionth coronavirus case on Sunday, with the latest million added in just 10 days, as most of the country struggled to contain outbreaks in the third and most widespread wave of infection since the pandemic began. More than 103,600 new cases were announced on Sunday, the fifth-highest total of the pandemic, according to a New York Times database, and the fifth day in a row the country exceeded 100,000 cases in a single day. Case reports have soared in the last week, shattering records. The seven-day average of new cases now exceeds 111,000 per day, far more than any other country. The United States accounts for about one-fifth of all reported coronavirus cases in the world, a total that has passed 50.2 million. In Europe, which accounts for as much or more of the global number, many countries have imposed restrictions far more severe than the limits in patches of the United States. With 28 states setting weekly case records, the virus is surging at a worrisome level in more than half the country. Nationwide, hospitalizations have nearly doubled since mid-September, and deaths are slowly increasing again, with few new interventions in place to stop the spiraling outbreak. On Monday, for the first time in weeks, Vice President Mike Pence will host a White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting. The American surge comes at the approach of a winter holiday season when many people will be considering whether to travel and attend indoor gatherings with friends and relatives — situations where the risk of virus transmission is high, public health experts say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people take into account how fast the virus is spreading in each community as they weigh the risks of traveling or of hosting out-of-town guests. As of Saturday, transmission rates in 44 states and Puerto Rico were high — above 15 new cases a day for every 100,000 people — and rising, according to a New York Times database. The Great Lakes, Great Plains and Mountain West states are where the virus has been spreading the fastest recently. North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin have led the country for weeks in the number of new cases relative to their population, and Iowa has recently shot up to match Wisconsin. Daily new case reports in Minnesota have doubled since Halloween, prompting the state health department to warn residents last week that even small gatherings pose risks of transmission. When the country reached the million-case mark in late April, the virus was more concentrated geographically — the New York area and the West Coast were the main hot spots — but outbreaks were surfacing elsewhere in vulnerable settings like nursing homes, prisons and meat packing plants. Shutdowns intended to rein in the virus had thrown more than 26 million Americans out of work, and many governors were impatient to ease restrictions despite warnings from public health experts that it was too soon. Six weeks after reaching a million cases, the nation passed the two million case mark. It took four weeks to add the third million, and less than three weeks each to add the fourth and fifth, as states in the Sun Belt struggled after early reopenings. By the end of August, the pace had slowed slightly, and the nation was taking three weeks or more to pass each million-case milestone. That changed in mid-October, when the virus began surging again across much of the country. The ninth million followed the eighth by just over two weeks, and now the 10th has taken just 10 days. Covid-19 deaths are also on the rise, though not yet as steeply as case reports. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 237,000 people had died from the virus in the United States, and the seven-day average of deaths per day was over 900 for the first time since August. The C.D.C. predicts that the toll could reach 256,000 by Nov. 21. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said he thinks that Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s election will cause governors and other leaders to “take a different tone.” “I think the political pressure of denying Covid is gone,” he said Sunday on the ABC program “This Week.” “I think you’ll see scientists speak with an unmuzzled voice now.” —

France and Italy report record cases as virus ravages Europe. Police patrolling during the first day of a lockdown in Milan on Friday. Italy and France reported record numbers of coronavirus infections in recent days. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times As winter approaches, Europe is struggling to grapple with a brutal resurgence of the virus, one that, along with the U.S. surge, has now helped push the global case count over 50 million, according to a New York Times database. France and Italy have reported record daily case totals in recent days as both countries have moved to lock down some regions. In Italy, where the devastation of the first wave in the spring looms large, 39,809 new coronavirus cases were reported on Saturday, a new daily record. Its daily average has increased by 119 percent over the past two weeks. Deaths in Italy have increased by a staggering 232 percent over the past two weeks, with 425 deaths reported on Saturday. Arno Kompatscher, the governor of Italy’s Bolzano Province, known for its ski resorts, moved on Sunday to lock down the area, limiting travel and closing most nonessential stores and in-person dining. Bolzano’s “red zone” restrictions add it to the list of Italian regions under strick lockdown; Valle d’Aosta, Piedmont and Lombardy — home to Milan — are also under shutdowns. France reported a record 60,486 new cases on Friday and 40,439 on Saturday. While the daily average there has risen by 57 percent over the past two weeks, deaths have increased by 170 percent in the same time frame. On Sunday, nine of the 10 countries with the highest average daily case totals per person were in Europe, including the Czech Republic (third highest), Switzerland (fourth highest) and France (eighth highest), according to a Times database. —

Navajo Nation, on a weekend lockdown, is experiencing a spike. A woman washing her hands before voting last week in the Navajo Nation. Credit... Sharon Chischilly for The New York Times The Navajo Nation, under a weekend lockdown, is averaging more than 100 new daily cases for the first time since early June. The nation, which stretches across much of northeastern Arizona and into parts of Utah and New Mexico, reported 124 new coronavirus cases and two new deaths on Saturday. A 56-hour curfew was in effect this weekend “due to the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 in 29 communities on the Navajo Nation,” Jonathan Nez, the Navajo president, said in a statement released on Sunday. That spread is “largely due to travel off the Navajo Nation and family gatherings,” the statement said. The nation has recorded 12,571 total cases and 593 deaths from the virus, according to the Navajo Department of Health. In addition to the strict weekend lockdown, a weekday curfew is in effect from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. “The numbers are not looking good for us here on the Navajo Nation and across the country,” Mr. Nez said in the statement. The curfews come after extensive restrictions this summer, when roads were closed to outside visitors, and restaurants — including even some fast food drive-throughs — were shut down. Despite the spike — cases began increasing at the end of September — voter turnout increased significantly this year compared with 2016 in the Arizona counties that overlap the Navajo and Hopi tribal lands. In Apache County, whose population is about three-quarters Native American, turnout increased by 27 percent since the 2016 election, with over 98 percent of votes reported on Sunday evening. —

President-elect Biden prepares to name his Covid-19 task force on Monday. Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke with health experts, including Dr. Vivek Murthy, at a Covid-19 briefing last month. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times In a victory speech on Saturday night, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was quickly focusing his attention on the raging pandemic, including plans on Monday to announce a task force of coronavirus advisers. As coronavirus outbreaks rage in the United States at harrowing new levels, Mr. Biden faces a nation divided over mask rules and business shutdowns, even as experts say the situation may further deteriorate before the new administration takes over in late January. Mr. Biden, who made criticism of President Trump’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign, left no doubt that the virus was his first priority. “Our work begins with getting Covid under control,” he said. Mr. Biden is expected to name three co-chairs of the 12-member panel: Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general, who has been a key Biden adviser for months and is expected to take a major public role; David Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University professor. The announcement of the task force would be part of a weeklong focus that Mr. Biden intends to place on health care and the pandemic, as he begins the process of building his administration, a person close to the transition said. During the campaign, Mr. Biden repeatedly assailed Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic, his refusal to wear a mask and his downplaying of the threat from the virus, which has spread across the country. “I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic,” Mr. Biden said Saturday. But Mr. Trump, who has largely shuttered the White House Coronavirus Task Force and has repeatedly told voters that the country was “rounding the corner,” is not due to leave office for two more months. And with U.S. cases now exceeding 10 million and surges reported much of the country, the pandemic shows every sign of exploding further in that period, deepening Mr. Biden’s challenge. Mr. Biden has vowed that on Day 1 of his administration, he will move rapidly to confront the pandemic by appointing a “national supply chain commander” and establishing a “pandemic testing board,” similar to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s wartime production panel. His aides have assembled a group of roughly two dozen health policy and technology experts to look at the development and delivery of a vaccine, improvement of health data and the securing of supply chains, among other issues. Aides said Mr. Biden would use the power of the presidency to invoke the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law, more aggressively than Mr. Trump has, to order businesses to build up stocks of necessary supplies. While Mr. Biden would like to see a national mask mandate, his advisers have concluded that he does not have the legal authority to impose one. So he will try to increase mask wearing in other ways. He has already said that, as president, he would require masks on all federal property, using an executive order that could have wide reach and is likely to come in the first hours or days of his presidency. In addition to mandating masks in federal buildings, Mr. Biden has said he would require them on “all interstate transportation.” — Michael D. Shear and

Inauguration Day in a pandemic may look very different. Having crowds gather outside the Capitol Building to witness a presidential inauguration, like President Trump’s in 2017, may not make sense now with the coronavirus surging, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Mr. Trump’s former F.D.A. chief, noted on Sunday. Credit... Damon Winter/The New York Times As he campaigned for the presidency, Joseph R. Biden Jr. spent months sequestered in his home in Delaware, and when he began holding live rallies, they were distanced, careful affairs. The Democratic National Convention was largely virtual. Even the jubilant crowd for his speech on Saturday, the day his victory in the election became clear, wore masks and largely observed social distancing. But what will his inauguration look like? When the president-elect takes office in January, the coronavirus pandemic may well be at its apex, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on Sunday. New cases in the country are surging, pushing the total reported in the pandemic past 10 million; hospitals are filling up; and there are few signs that anything is likely to change the trend for the better before Inauguration Day. “We’re going to be right in the thick of probably the worst part of this epidemic wave that we’re going through right now,” said Dr. Gottlieb, who served under President Trump, in an appearance on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” As Mr. Biden “takes office, we’ll be coming down to the other side of the epidemic curve, hopefully,” he said. “And the only question is going to be, how many people have died in the course of this and how many people have been infected?” Congress’s inauguration committee is still planning for an “outside, full-scale” event, according to Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who chairs the joint Senate-House panel that organizes the ceremony. On ABC’s Sunday show “This Week,” Mr. Blunt said the election was not over because of the legal challenges still pending. The senator also said that he expected to see “both Vice President Biden and President Trump on the stage on Inaugural Day, and that’ll be a powerful message no matter which one of them is sworn in.” The platform for the ceremony is already under construction outside the Capitol Building. “It’s easier to scale back than scale up,” Mr. Blunt said. Dr. Gottlieb said that pandemic precautions would probably mean that there will be no large crowds of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. The Biden team has “shown they’re willing to forgo the usual trappings of running for office so that they don’t expose people unnecessarily,” he said. “I suspect they are going to take a similar approach to how they handle the inauguration.” —

Students disinfecting their hands before class at Santhormok High School in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, earlier this month. Credit... Heng Sinith/Associated Press Schools in a province that includes Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, will shut again for two weeks to curb any potential spread of coronavirus from Hungary’s foreign minister, who led a delegation to the Southeast Asian country last week and tested positive for coronavirus the day he left. The country is anxious to keep the virus out. It has logged only 294 coronavirus cases for the entirety of the pandemic and no deaths, according to a Times database. The schools, which closed in March, had a limited reopening last Monday. But now, as a precaution, classes at public and private schools in Kandal Province will move back online, the education ministry said, according to local media. The authorities decided on the closures after officials were unable to gather sufficient information from about 900 parents and guardians of students who interacted with the Hungarian delegation during the visit. The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, met with Cambodian officials, including the Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, on Tuesday, the last day of the visit. Mr. Szijjarto then flew to Thailand, where he tested positive. He was quarantined and evacuated back to Hungary on Wednesday. So far, only a Cambodian bodyguard who had contact with Mr. Szijjarto has tested positive, the Cambodian health ministry said on Saturday. But the Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen, said the country should take no risks. “I regard this matter as a severe problem for Phnom Penh, and I ask the Phnom Penh authority, the health sector, ministries, institutions and media covering Szijjarto to quarantine their staff,” Mr. Hun Sen said, according to the Phnom Penh Post on Sunday. “If not, the risk is very high for our country.” Prime Minister Hun Sen said that he had tested negative, and that he and other ministers who met Mr. Szijjarto would quarantine for two weeks. He also described the precautions he was taking to the Phnom Penh Post, including reducing time in his office and at home staying largely in two rooms. He said all documents that he received or sent were sprayed with antiseptic, and that workers at his house wore gloves. —

Mink in Denmark stoke worries about other animals that could harbor the coronavirus and spread mutations. Some of the 3,000 mink set to be culled at a single farm in Denmark. To prevent the spread of a coronavirus mutation, the country ordered all farmed mink to be killed, effectively wiping out its mink industry. Credit... Mads Claus Rasmussen/Agence France-Presse, via Getty Images The mutation of the coronavirus in mink, which has caused Denmark to order the killing of all farmed mink, has sharpened the worry among scientists that the pathogen could spread to other wild and domestic animals. The most disturbing possibility is that the virus could mutate in animals and become more transmissible or more dangerous to humans. In Denmark, the virus shifted from humans to mink and back to humans, which is when a mutation that could potentially undercut the effectiveness of a vaccine was discovered. Thus far, mink are the only animal known to have been infected by the virus and then passed it back to humans, but scientists have been actively investigating the potential for coronavirus infections in other wild and domestic animals, concerned that the virus could become permanently established in a wild species. “The last thing we need is for SARS-CoV-2 to move into an animal reservoir from which it could re-emerge,” Tony Goldberg, a veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said. Genetic studies suggest that chimpanzees, other apes and old world monkeys are among the species most susceptible to the coronavirus. Chimpanzee reserves and sanctuaries are taking increased precautions to avoid humans infecting the animals. Among domestic animals, dogs and cats can become infected, but they exhibit little if any illness, and there are no known cases of pets passing the virus back to humans. Many scientists are actively monitoring wild populations of bats and other animals for any sign of coronavirus infection. Kate Sawatzki, the animal surveillance coordinator for a testing project in pets and other animals at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, said: “To date, we have tested 282 wildlife samples from 22 species, primarily bats in New England rehabilitation facilities, and we are happy to report that none have been positive.” —

Some N.Y.C. co-op buildings begin increasing residents’ fees to make up for lost commercial rent. A co-op on West 105th Street has had to lower rents for its storefronts, resulting in higher maintenance fees for shareholders. Credit... Katherine Marks for The New York Times As the coronavirus devastates New York City’s retail economy, making it hard for stores to pay rent, co-op buildings with ground-floor stores are losing a vital source of income. Already stressed co-op shareholders have had to pick up the slack, in some cases with maintenance charges increasing by as much as 40 percent. “It’s a huge problem,” said Michael Wolfe, the president of Midboro Management, who added that residents are grumbling about the extra costs, as they also struggle with reduced work, furloughs and layoffs. But Mr. Wolfe said that most residents realize that “anything is better than a vacancy,” adding that co-ops would face long odds at finding replacement tenants during the pandemic. Also driving the decision to accommodate stores rather than evict them is a desire to preserve the convenience of having on-site shops, board members say. Other co-ops want to preserve jobs of employees who have become like family members after years of operating businesses under the same roof, like at 230 West 105th Street, a 14-story co-op. Its board has hiked maintenance fees 15 percent, which for a one-bedroom means a jump to about $1,400 from $1,200 a month, to make up for discounts offered to the four stores that ring the prewar building’s base. That aid, which is benefiting a clothing store, coffee shop, deli and cobbler, is the equivalent of as much as a 50 percent rent cut, according to the board. “One shareholder called the move unconscionable,” said Robert Chasen, the treasurer of the 70-unit doorman building. According to Mr. Chasen, about half of the apartments in the building are occupied by people on fixed incomes or who are working class. “But most neighbors say they are supportive,” he said. “These stores contribute to our neighborhood.” —

Queen Elizabeth II wears a mask in public for the first time. The queen attended a ceremony in Westminster Abbey, London, on Wednesday for the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. Credit... Pool photo by Aaron Chown Queen Elizabeth II of England was seen wearing a face mask for the first time on Wednesday at a private ceremony during the prelude to Remembrance Sunday, which mourns the British and Commonwealth troops who have died in conflicts. Wearing a black mask with white edging, the queen supervised the laying of a bouquet of flowers on the grave of the Unknown Warrior as a “personal tribute,” according to a statement from Buckingham Palace. The soldier was buried in Westminster Abbey on Nov. 11, 1920, after the end of World War I, and the grave has become a national symbol of remembrance. Queen Elizabeth, 94, requested the service, according to the BBC, after learning that Remembrance Sunday events would be scaled down because of coronavirus restrictions. She watched Sunday’s service, which was held in central London, from a balcony. Other senior royals, along with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, also attended the ceremony, which was closed to the public but broadcast online. The queen’s appearance was her first in public since October, when she and her grandson Prince William met scientists at the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory, the BBC noted. Neither wore face masks on that occasion, though Buckingham Palace representatives said at the time that other precautions had been taken to protect the queen’s health. Concerns over an outbreak in the royal family grew in March, when Prince Charles, the queen’s son and heir to the throne, tested positive for the coronavirus. Reports also emerged in British news outlets on Monday that Prince William had contracted the virus in April but did not reveal his diagnosis for fear of alarming the public. His representatives have declined to comment. Officials have recommended that face masks be worn indoors in England, where a new national lockdown began on Thursday, in an effort to break a second coronavirus surge. Britain averaged about 22,800 new infections a day this past week, according to a Times database. As of Sunday, the country had reported at least 1.1 million cases and 48,888 deaths.

In Paris, booksellers along the Seine try to hold off an unhappy ending. “Reading seriously harms stupidity!” is noted next to a functioning landline phone at Jérôme Callais’s bookstall on Quai de Conti along the Seine in Paris. Credit... Mauricio Lima for The New York Times PARIS — On a recent breezy day, Jérôme Callais wrapped a secondhand biography of Robespierre tightly in cellophane, covering the burgundy leather hardcover with an expert flick of the wrist and positioning it near a weighty tome on Talleyrand inside his dark green bookstand above the Seine. In normal times, Parisiens and tourists from around the world would be browsing his wares, and those of the roughly 230 other open-air booksellers known as “les bouquinistes,” whose boxy metal bookstalls stretch for nearly four miles along the Left and Right banks of the river. But as lockdown restrictions to curb the coronavirus pandemic keep browsers at bay, the booksellers’ livelihood is in jeopardy. Over four-fifths of the stands are more or less permanently shuttered. Many are bracing for what they fear may be the final chapter for a centuries-old métier that is as iconic to Paris as the Louvre and Notre Dame. “We’re trying to keep this ship from sinking,” said Mr. Callais, 60, who is also the president of the Association of Bouquinistes. “But Covid has made most of our customers disappear.” Even before France imposed a new nationwide lockdown last month to combat a resurgence of the virus, the tourists had largely stopped coming. And the beloved Parisien pastime of flânerie — strolling aimlessly to enjoy life — has been all but snuffed out, stifled by curfews and quarantines that have deprived the booksellers of die-hard clients. Sales have plunged an average of 80 percent this year, Mr. Callais said, throwing many vendors into precarious straits, especially those who milked Eiffel Tower key chains, Mona Lisa coffee mugs and other kitschy souvenirs over books as cash cows when tourists jammed the quais. David Nosek is one of the bouquinistess trying to stay open. “The bouquinistes have been here since the Middle Ages,” he said. “I’d like to think that the coronavirus won’t finish us off.” —

He couldn’t shut up. If you gave him the microphone, he thrilled to it, wouldn’t surrender it, sang an aria that turned into a whole damned opera.

A bunch of us Times columnists had lunch with him at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., in 2012 and came away commenting on how spirited, upbeat and warm he was, but also on how he talked and talked and talked.

The following year, he visited the Times Building in Manhattan and sat down with a small group of editors and writers. He talked even more. We were lucky to get in a question every 10 minutes.

But something happened between then and now. He got older. He suffered great loss with the death of his son Beau. And Trump happened, too, providing the country with an example of hubris so monumental — and self-fascination so malignant — that any sane and sensitive observer would recoil from it, look for traces of those toxins in himself and purge them, especially if volunteering to be the antidote to that egomania.

Biden’s campaign verged on self-effacing even before the pandemic compelled a retreat from the campaign trail and a shedding of all the pomp that a presidential bid typically entails.

In those early primary debates, while Biden’s rivals talked past their time limits, he’d cut himself off, coloring dutifully within the lines. Technically, physically, he was always in the center of the stage. Effectively, he was anywhere but.

He positioned himself not as the heir to the Democratic tradition or as a messiah charting the party’s future but as a transitional figure. What could be humbler than that? Sure, this was strategic, but it would have rung hollow had it not been matched by his bearing."
27,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/opinion/donald-trump-conservatives.html,Opinion | The Conservative Movement Needs a Reckoning,"The second reason Trump lost is that conservatives never tried to check his immorality. They rationalized, excused, enabled and ultimately celebrated it. For Trump’s presidency to have had even a faint chance of succeeding, he needed his allies and fellow travelers to provide reality checks and expressions of disapproval, including occasions of outright revolt. What he mainly got was an echo chamber.

The process began before Trump’s election, when conservative pundits thrilled to the idea that Trump’s serial violations of moral and ethical norms were signs of strength and authenticity, as opposed to simple depravity. Just as ignorance was strength in George Orwell’s “1984,” shamelessness became virtue in Trump’s G.O.P. The strategy of moral inversion appeared to be vindicated four years ago, since none of Trump’s successive scandals prevented his victory.

In Trump’s conservative universe, nearly everyone became a lickspittle. Among his fervent supporters, or those who drew better ratings or poll numbers from his presidency, this was at least understandable. They had TV careers to preserve, political jobs to fill, a cult leader to worship.

Less forgivable was the political Manichaeism turned into moral nihilism: When the left is always, definitionally, “worse than the right,” then the right feels entitled to permit itself everything, no matter how badly it trashes conservative policies (outreach to North Korea), betrays conservative principles (trade tariffs), debases the office (arms-for-dirt with Ukraine) or shames the nation (child separation). Stalinists used to justify their crimes in much the same way.

The historic irony here is that these permission slips for Trump served the master ill. Who in the White House had the clout of someone like James Baker to set the president straight and serve as something more than a yes-man? And who in the broader conservative world — someone Trump might have seen on Fox, for instance — could explain that attempting to fool all of the people all of the time was a losing strategy? Did Rupert Murdoch or Mitch McConnell ever put in an admonitory word?

For America, this failure to do much more than flatter, defend and delude Trump these past four years is a blessing. For conservatives, it calls for a reckoning.

It’s probably going to end up called for Joe Biden; his lead is razor-thin, but most observers expect it to survive a recount. And the January runoff races in Georgia offer Democrats their last chance to take the Senate.

Beyond the immediate electoral implications, however, the fact that Democrats are now competitive in Georgia but not in Ohio, which appears to have become Trumpier than Texas, tells you a lot about where America is heading. In some ways these changes in the electoral map offer reason for hope; but they also suggest looming problems for U.S. democracy.

How did Georgia turn faintly blue? As The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson wrote, in a phrase I wish I’d come up with, the great divide in American politics is now over “density and diplomas”: highly urbanized states — especially those containing large metropolitan areas — with highly educated populations tend to be Democratic.

Why this particular partisan association? Think about the longer-term political strategy of the modern G.O.P. Republican economic policy is relentlessly plutocratic: tax cuts for the rich, benefit cuts for everyone else. The party has, however, sought to win over voters who aren’t rich by taking advantage of intolerance — racial hostility, of course, but also opposition to social change in general."

They’re Not Going Anywhere.,"NASHVILLE — For at least a week before Election Day, I was too anxious to focus. Donald Trump was running a re-election campaign founded in lies, and I had no faith that my fellow Americans would throw him out. The polls were reassuring, but I wasn’t reassured. Polls were reassuring in 2016, too, and this country still ended up in an abusive relationship with the most corrupt and dangerous president of my lifetime.

I had no faith, but I held out hope. The ubiquity of the anti-Trump ads created by The Lincoln Project, a group of Republican operatives endorsing Joe Biden, gave me hope. A change of heart in so many of my conservative friends — disgusted by Mr. Trump’s greed and deception and boorish behavior, disgusted by his inexplicable subservience to foreign despots, his encouragement of outrageous conspiracy theories, his loyalty to his own interests and no one else’s — gave me hope. Above all, the massive registration and get-out-the-vote effort in Black communities across the country gave me hope. Change was in the air — I could feel it. An uprising was upon us. A great repudiation was at hand.

A plan for containing the pandemic was finally coming. A serious reckoning with climate change, a fair approach to immigration, criminal justice reform, a strong health care safety net, a renewed emphasis on voting rights — all suddenly possible.

On election night I was quadruple-screening the coverage — The Times on my laptop, PBS on our television, Twitter on my iPad, half a dozen text threads going with friends on my phone — and the news kept getting grimmer and grimmer. “This is exactly the way I felt four years ago,” my brother texted as early results came in."
30,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/opinion/election-2020-libertarians-deficit-hawks.html,Why the Election Worked Out Well for Libertarians and Deficit Hawks - The New York Times,"In the early years of the Trump administration, with Republicans in control of Congress, the country saw a steady rise in spending and ballooning deficits and debt. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas might not have been quite right when he said that, after all, President Trump “didn’t campaign on cutting the debt.” Actually, Mr. Trump did, but in a throwaway manner, while putting more stress on continued, even increased, big spending and debt.

And as is so often the case with one-party control, as in Mr. Trump’s first years, big spending took hold. According to the Cato Institute, over Mr. Trump’s four years, spending went up by a total of 10 percent. Something similar happened under George W. Bush: Spending shot up 24 percent.

But what really seems like an effective arrangement for controlling spending is a Democratic president with Republicans in charge of at least one body of Congress. During the first four years of the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton administrations, both of which included years of split control of government, spending was more restrained or even reduced. Under Mr. Clinton, spending inched up only 3 percent. In Mr. Obama’s first term, total spending actually went down by 10 percent.

There are ways beyond the budget that a Biden presidency could be a boon to libertarians. Mr. Trump was a disaster when it came to free trade, kicking off a huge trade war with China and “renegotiating” NAFTA so that it contained more protectionist, anti-free-market measures like wage controls.

By contrast, Mr. Biden will probably cut a more pro-trade profile. Congressional Republicans and Democrats were reluctant to give Mr. Trump trade negotiating authority, but they are more likely to give Mr. Biden that authority than they are to withhold it (despite some pressure from the party’s progressives like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)."

Think of how much farmers depend on government subsidies. On the flip side, think of the substandard levels of government services in a lot of big cities. People are always more complicated and contradictory than any one data point about them suggests.

Gail: Certainly true, as we have been reminded every single day lately.

Bret: Speaking of data, Gail, one interesting thing about this election is how badly most of the pollsters seem to have muffed their electoral predictions. Just take a look at the FiveThirtyEight election eve polls. In Ohio, they gave Trump an edge of 0.8 percentage points. He won by 8 points. In Florida, the FiveThirtyEight forecast had Biden beating Trump by 2.5 percentage points. Trump ended up with a 3 point lead. In Wisconsin, they gave Biden an 8.4 point lead. Biden won it by less than a point.

Should this be the end of the polling as we’ve known it?

Gail: I was always in awe of the polling people just because they had to walk that tightrope of expectations. One bad prediction and you’re in free-fall.

Bret: In this case, it’s been two massive failures in consecutive presidential elections. The failure will be partially obscured by Biden’s ultimate victory, but there ought to be some accountability for the industry.

Gail: It’s become very, very clear that getting accurate predictions is next to impossible when the subject is Donald Trump. And I’m not sure what will happen after he’s actually gone (please, God). Maybe people will go back to giving more reliable responses to the surveyors. Or maybe the science just doesn’t work well in our new digital universe.

Bret: We definitely learned that the phenomenon of the shy Trump voter didn’t end when he became president. We also learned that people don’t necessarily vote the way they are often typecast by parts of the media. Exit polls showed Trump doubled his support among L.G.B.T.Q. voters. His share of the Hispanic vote also went up steeply, and he also did better with Black voters this time around. Another reminder that people are just … complicated.

Gail: Before we go, tell me — any big surprises for you in the Senate races?

Bret: The biggest surprise for me was in Maine, with Susan Collins’s thumping win over Sara Gideon. (Not to belabor a theme here, Gail, but FiveThirtyEight gave Gideon a 59 percent chance of winning.) On the other hand, I predicted Joni Ernst’s win in Iowa, Thom Tillis’s in North Carolina and Lindsey Graham’s in South Carolina. The big question for everyone is whether Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler manage to hold on to their seats in Georgia, which will determine control of the Senate."

Since election night, when I wake up, that glass of wine has remained full and untouched. I no longer need that glass of wine to take the edge off. There is no edge.

To the Editor:

Now that President Trump has lost the election, my family and our nation must acknowledge a debt of gratitude to him. He forced my children, ages 23 to 33, to pay close attention to politics for the first time in their lives. He compelled them, in ways I never could, to understand the intricacies and absurdity of the Electoral College. I am also grateful that he spurred them to activism on behalf of those less fortunate than themselves.

And most important, thank you, Mr. Trump, for exposing the evil marrow that simmers in the bones of our nation so that we can get to work on replacing it with something healthier."
33,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/opinion/how-to-protect-america-from-the-next-donald-trump.html,Opinion | How to Protect America From the Next Donald Trump,"Whichever story we tell about the past, the work in front of us remains. We could start by repairing the parts of the constitutional structure that were supposed to insulate our leaders from the temptation to be demagogues and give them incentives to take responsibility for long-term results. The constitutional framers hoped that distributing power among the states, channeling political ambition toward offices with clearly circumscribed but overlapping powers, keeping the Senate small and senators’ terms long, and filtering presidential elections through state legislatures would all help contain demagogues.

It is a stain on our country’s honor that these anti-demagogic parts of our constitution were sullied by their use to defend slavery and Jim Crow. In acknowledging that historical fact, however, we can’t let ourselves off the hook for dealing with the general problem they were meant to address. Any serious constitutional reform would consider not only which party benefits from these institutions, but also how best to balance responsiveness and responsibility. Political parties and the media regulatory environment need reform too — but in devising strategies we should be thinking not only about openness but also about how to create the conditions in which we, the people, are most likely to resist demagogic appeals and make our own best judgments.

The college-educated elite and well-meaning technocrats may say that expert rule is the only alternative to demagogues, but they are wrong. When we allow them to rule, we fuel popular frustration and drive people into the arms of demagogues in reaction. The real alternative is to strengthen our ability to govern ourselves well by supporting the kinds of schools and jobs that train us in the habits of citizenship, by creating the background conditions in which we can solve more problems in our families and communities, and by reforming electoral systems and legislative procedures to strengthen the incentives for politicians to move beyond demagogy. Too many of us are guilty of prioritizing immediate policy outcomes over the work of maintaining a system of self-government that will bring out the best in us over the long term.

These sorts of reforms will only work, however, if they help us find our way out of a demagogic society and into a constitutional culture in which leaders feel ashamed for not helping us “refine and enlarge” our political passions. Plato wrote that demagogues were like the makers of pastries who give us what we crave in the moment but not what will make us healthy. Do we now allow the modern equivalent of pastry chefs to dominate our society? Literally, yes: We subsidize corn syrup and pay the price in health care. Figuratively, yes: We refuse to regulate social media even as it titrates dopamine in a way designed to distract us from serious projects into one click after another. Economically, yes: We rely on ever-growing consumer demand, confusing freedom with the ability to increase the size and intensity of our desires in a way that ensures we are never satisfied. We cultivate in ourselves impatience, impertinence and insatiability — the very qualities of a demagogue.

Allowing our desires to grow always larger is like spending our lives trying to fill a sieve, or welcoming a lifetime of itchiness so that we can always have the satisfaction of scratching ourselves again. These are Plato’s analogies from thousands of years ago, meant to make us feel ashamed for not aiming at something higher.

Once the election is over, shame may be a more constructive emotion than anger. Anger will continue to set us against one another in cycles of blame and vengeance, but shame could bring us together into an effort at self-correction. If the intensified demagogy we have seen lately comes about partly from our own mismanagement of our constitutional democracy, then a solution will require a hard look in the mirror. The demagogues themselves will not do this, but demagogues can be managed through their dependence on us. Will we become ashamed at having allowed ourselves to be so caught up in scratching our own itches that we let a critical mass of our fellow citizens think a vulgar charlatan was their last, best hope? Could it be that we’ve had the leader we deserved? We should aim to deserve better. The first step toward self-government is to recognize that the challenges do not all, or even mainly, come from fascistic authoritarians foreign to democracy but from ourselves and our way of life.

The ballot counting will continue for a few days yet, but the math is what it is: Joe Biden will have the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, and likely many more. President Trump’s four-year assault on our democratic institutions and values will soon end.

The contest generated intense passions. In a year marked by the incalculable loss of life and the economic devastation of a pandemic, Americans turned out to vote in numbers not seen for generations, starting weeks before Election Day. Mr. Trump still knows how to draw a crowd — albeit not always to his advantage. In the end, it was Mr. Biden who captured more votes than any presidential candidate in U.S. history, while Mr. Trump captured the second-most votes in U.S. history.

The tally comes with disappointment on both sides: for Biden supporters, who hoped for a more resounding repudiation of Trumpism and for a Senate ready to enact their agenda, and for Trump supporters, who hoped for another four years and to chasten their critics. Fortunately for America, Mr. Biden promises to be a president for both sides — a welcome shift from a leader who has spent his tenure dividing the electorate into perceived fans and enemies.

While the coming weeks will most likely bring unexpected moves and more dangerous disinformation from Mr. Trump, it is worth taking this moment to raise a glass and breathe a sigh of relief. America gives its citizenry the ultimate responsibility for holding leaders accountable, for deciding what kind of nation this will be. The broad endorsement of Mr. Biden’s message of unity and healing is cause for celebration. Americans have embraced that optimism and Mr. Biden as their next president."

Joe Biden will be president because of his close association with Barack Obama, because he espoused many of the same centrist policies and positioning and because of public nostalgia for the normalcy and decency the Obama years provided.

Biden is a restoration president-elect, elected to right the ship and save the system. He is not so much a change agent as a reversion agent. He is elected to Make America Able to Sleep Again.

He doesn’t see his mission as shaking things up, but calming things down.

But, just as was the case with Obama, many of the people who made Biden’s win possible are far to the left of him. As Biden told a Miami television station last month: “I’m the guy that ran against socialists, OK. I’m the guy that’s the moderate. Remember, you guys were all talking, you’d interview me and say, ‘Well, you’re a moderate, how can you win the nomination?’ It’s who I am.” But progressives are not likely to be as silent now as they were during the Obama years.

Obama faced intense, often unfair, resistance from the right on every front, so many who wanted to push him in a more progressive direction held their criticism or limited it for fear of adding to the damage being done to him by his conservative opposition."

Mr. Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin (the titular head of the Shanghai Gang), who maintained influence over senior appointments and the military during Mr. Hu’s tenure, is now an ailing 94, and he and his acolytes have been kept in their place by the threat of anti-corruption investigations, should any of them be tempted to push back.

And now, too, Mr. Xi’s strength has only been reinforced by the coronavirus pandemic.

After early cover-ups of the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese government deployed the authoritarian tools at its disposal very effectively. Unencumbered by the messy discussions that have bogged down some democracies, China promptly closed provincial borders, stopped domestic travel, shut down businesses and confined millions of citizens to their homes — measures that were implemented firmly thanks partly to the state’s surveillance capacity.

A crisis that risked looking like a systemic meltdown was soon recast as a battle of national will and patriotism — of the rally-around-the-party, more than rally-around-the-flag, kind.

Ren Zhiqiang, the real-estate tycoon known as “Big Cannon” Ren, called Mr. Xi a “clown” during the early, difficult stages of the coronavirus outbreak. In the past, Mr. Ren’s excellent connections in the party had afforded him protection for his outspokenness. Not this time. He was investigated for corruption, expelled from the C.C.P. and in September sentenced to 18 years in prison.

By then, Mr. Xi and the party were enjoying a major propaganda windfall. The population could readily see how the coronavirus had largely stopped spreading in China, whereas a mess was unfolding, again, in the United States and many European democracies, as new outbreaks were about to force some of those countries back into lockdown. China’s economy grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2020, and some economists project that it may soon return to pre-pandemic growth rates.

The intensifying confrontation between China and the Trump administration has only played into this narrative, allowing Mr. Xi to portray various policies as necessary measures in an existential struggle against an implacable enemy dead-set on destroying China."

He paused, nodding.

“Do you want to hear that I loved you?” she said. “I did. Do you think I pined for you? I suppose I did. I thought you were dead already, though I had guessed you might still be alive. Do you want me to tell you how grateful I am that you gave up on us? To say I had the better life without you? I did. There, I’ve said it.”

She stopped moving her glass and drained it. And when she put it down, she laughed.

He seemed afraid of her, and the idea that she could scare the ghost made her laugh again.

“I would never have gone to Mokpo, or I would never have stayed,” she said.

He waited, and when she said nothing more, he finished his story. He found his way back to South Korea, sought and received defector status, was reunited with his ancestral lands, his wife and children. Five years ago, he brought them to Germany, to show them this country.

He took his wife and children on the tourist excursions — the art museum, the Völkerschlachtdenkmal, the Stasi museum. As he went by the train station, he saw her through the window of her restaurant. He watched her as she greeted some guests and waited for her to look into the street and see him, but she did not.

The glass in her hand shot through the air, through him. Smashing on the wall behind him.

“I wanted to say goodbye. I knew we had no future,” he said. “I just wanted to say goodbye. I loved you. We had no future together.”

He stood then and with the glamour of the dead, they were on the balcony in East Berlin again, that first night, the smoke on her lips as he kissed her. They were in the ambassador’s apartment, him underneath her, his eyes tied shut. They were everywhere they had ever been, and then he was gone, and she stood in her apartment, her eyes wet with sorrow and rage but also the peculiar joy of knowing she was right. She bent over, alone at last, to pick the shards of glass up from the floor."

Sunset Park

Dear Diary:

It was one of those late-summer nights where it’s still warm enough to wear a T-shirt but brisk enough that you might get a slight chill.

I was biking along Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn after having a burrito at a small Mexican grocery in Sunset Park. Just as I passed Sunset Park itself, I noticed a woman I had once worked with at a call center.

“Linda?” I said. “Is that you?”

It was, and we chatted for a while in front of the park.

When we worked together, Linda would tell me about how she fed Mountain Dew to the trees in the park and about how she enjoyed going to a church near where she lived to watch the choir rehearse. She had changed a bit, but our conversation transported me straight back to the past.

“I think I’ve seen every single Marvel film twice over,” Linda said, breaking into a smile.

We walked to a nearby deli, where she wrote down my number on a loose sheet of paper."

They’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for We the People. We’ve won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of the nation: 74 million. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify, who doesn’t see red states and blue states, only sees the United States."
