Gen. Mike Flynn, the first national security adviser for President Donald Trump, was prosecuted under an arcane law called the Logan Act for having precisely such communications with foreign leaders before Trump was sworn in.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has been accused of suggesting the Logan Act as a pretext for investigating Flynn, although other Obama administration officials claim the idea did not come from Biden.

Rhodes said Biden is already talking to foreign leaders during an MSNBC appearance on Monday afternoon:

Rhodes made his comments while scoffing at President Donald Trump for contesting the results of last week’s election.

“The Trump people seem to be talking like they have some agency here. We’re going to have the pageantry already of the president-elect announcing his advisory board. He’s going to start announcing cabinet secretaries. The center of political gravity in this country and the world is shifting to Joe Biden. Foreign leaders are already having phone calls with Joe Biden, talking about the agenda they’re going to pursue January 20th,” said Rhodes.

“I remember, I was on the incoming side, where I felt the spotlight shifting to us in 2008 and I was on the outgoing side in 2016 when it was shifting away from us to Donald Trump. That’s just going to happen regardless of what they do,” Rhodes added.

Gen. Mike Flynn resigned soon after Trump took office in 2017 because Obama advisers accused him of violating the Logan Act by communicating with foreign officials, specifically Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

The Logan Act is a 1799 law that forbids private citizens from discussing U.S. foreign policy with foreign governments or their representatives. No one has ever been fully prosecuted under the Logan Act, not even the person for whom it is named, a doctor named George Logan accused of treasonously subverting the foreign policy of the young American republic by holding negotiations with France.

Flynn had a phone conversation with Kislyak on December 29, 2016 — long after Trump was certified as the winner of the 2016 election — during which he discussed sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia after the Russians were accused of trying to influence the election. Flynn told Kislyak he wanted the Russians to refrain from retaliating for the sanctions and escalating the diplomatic feud between Russia and America before Trump took office.

The FBI recorded Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak while monitoring the Russian ambassador. During one of the last Oval Office meetings between Obama and his advisers on January 5, 2017, it was suggested that Flynn could be investigated and prosecuted for violating the Logan Act. Notes from former FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok released by the Justice Department in June 2020 indicated it was Biden who suggested using the Logan Act to pursue Flynn.

Sally Yates, deputy attorney general under the Obama administration and briefly acting attorney general under Trump, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August 2020 that she could not remember if Biden brought up the Logan Act.

Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September that Biden did not suggest prosecuting Flynn for violating the Logan Act. “I would remember it because it would be highly inappropriate. It did not happen,” he said.

Flynn was accused of lying to FBI agents in a January 24, 2017, interview when he told them he did not discuss U.S. sanctions with Kislyak. Flynn resigned his position as national security adviser on February 13, 2017, stating he had given “incomplete information” about his phone call to Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak before Trump was sworn in. Flynn moved to withdraw his guilty plea in January 2020, claiming the government violated the terms of his plea deal. Flynn’s sentencing was postponed, although the judge said in September he was not prepared to throw out the case entirely. The judge ordered the Justice Department to review its filings in the Flynn case in late October after several documents were found to have been altered.

The conversations between Biden and foreign leaders claimed by Ben Rhodes would at least potentially be violations of the Logan Act for the same reason Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak were, and Biden is currently even further from taking office than Flynn was at the time. This would be especially true if the Trump administration’s sanctions or other policies were discussed with foreign officials.

Documents discovered on a laptop owned by Joe Biden’s son Hunter raised serious questions about whether Biden was involved in foreign business deals of dubious propriety, including deals that involved agents of the Chinese government."

However, he himself accused George W. Bush and rival Al Gore of plotting to “steal” the 2000 election.

Ben Domenech, the co-founder of The Federalist, drew attention to Tapper’s hypocrisy in a tweet Monday evening:

2020 Jake Tapper: I, as CNN's precious flower and conscience of media, order you to drop any allegations of election fraud as it is anti-American and worthy of losing your job just for retweeting 2000 Jake Tapper: I write book for moneys BUSH STOLE IT ALL pic.twitter.com/cmTEwCRpQG — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) November 10, 2020

Tapper’s book, Down and Dirty: The Plot to Steal the Presidency, is still available on Amazon.com. A blurb describes the book as claiming that “both sides, Democrats and Republicans, plotted to steal the presidency in 2000.”

At the time, Tapper was the Washington correspondent for the left-wing online magazine Salon.com. He later worked for ABC News as a White House correspondent before landing a new role at CNN, hosting The Lead with Jake Tapper and State of the Union.

The CNN anchor drew wide condemnation Monday for suggesting that Trump staffers who did not abandon the president in his legal and electoral fight ought to be blacklisted from further employment in the political world.

CNN has played the president’s battle as an attempt to maintain power in spite of the democratic will of the people, rather than a legal and constitutional attempt to ascertain whether the results of the election, as reported, were in fact correct.

Tapper has treated the president and his staff with scorn throughout Trump’s presidency.

The poll of 1,987 registered voters, conducted by Morning Consult and Politico, began before Election Day, though most interviews were done afterward.

A majority of both Democrats and Republicans appear to have believed the election would be free and fair before the votes were counted, but the result have changed their impressions radically.

Politico reported:

Multiple new organizations announced Biden as the election winner on Saturday after four days of counting in several swing states. Following the news, 70 percent of Republicans now say they don’t believe the 2020 election was free and fair, a stark rise from the 35 percent of GOP voters who held similar beliefs before the election. Meanwhile, trust in the election system grew for Democrats, many who took to the streets to celebrate Biden’s victory on Saturday. Ninety percent of Democrats now say the election was free and fair, up from 52 percent before Nov. 3 who thought it would be. Among Republicans who believed that the election wasn’t free and fair, 78 percent believed that mail-in voting led to widespread voter fraud and 72 percent believed that ballots were tampered with — both claims that have made a constant appearance on the president’s Twitter thread. Like President Donald Trump, a majority of the people that thought the election was unfair, 84 percent, said it benefited Biden. The lack of trust in the election system has led to Republicans being more skeptical about the election results. Although only 18 percent of Republicans had said the results would be unreliable prior to Election Day, now 64 percent feel the same way following Biden’s victory. By contrast, 86 percent of Democrats say they trust the results.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international body, has set standards for determining whether an election is, in fact, “free and fair.”

The standards include (emphasis added):

(3) Everyone individually and together with others has the right: To express political opinions without interference ;

; To seek, receive and impart information and to make an informed choice ;

; To move freely within the country in order to campaign for election;

in order to campaign for election; To campaign on an equal basis with other political parties, including the party forming the existing government. (4) Every candidate for election and every political party shall have an equal opportunity of access to the media, particularly the mass communications media, in order to put forward their political views. (5) The right of candidates to security with respect to their lives and property shall be recognized and protected.

Many of the conditions above were violated during the 2020 election, thanks to social media censorship, coronavirus restrictions, and political violence.

The standards also require that “steps are taken to guarantee non-partisan coverage in State and public-service media,” a principle violated by demonstrable media bias, including by publicly-funded outlets.

In addition, the standards provide that governments should “take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that the principle of the secret ballot is respected, and that voters are able to cast their ballots freely, without fear or intimidation.”

As Breitbart News has noted, the secret ballot is arguably compromised by vote-by-mail, because the name of the voter accompanies a ballot on the outer envelope.

Finally, the standards require “the transparency of the entire electoral process including, for example, through the presence of party agents and duly accredited observers.” Republican observers say they have been excluded in several states.

The memo was addressed and signed from Barr to U.S. Attorneys, the assistant attorneys general for the DOJ’s criminal division, civil rights division, the national security division, and the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Christopher Wray.

“Now that the voting has concluded, it is imperative that the American people can trust that our elections were conducted in such a way that the outcomes accurately reflect the will of the voters,” the memo read.

Barr’s memo comes after 39 House Republicans pressed Barr in a letter on Friday to allow available DOJ resources to look into allegations of voting irregularities across the country in several key battleground states. The Trump campaign has filed a number of lawsuits in some of those states.

Barr Memo to DOJ on voting irregularities by Kristina Wong on Scribd

Barr said in his memo that, although the states have the primary responsibility to conduct and supervise elections, the DOJ has “an obligation to ensure that federal elections are conducted in such a way that the American people can have full confidence in their electoral process and their government.”

He added that while “most allegations” of purported election misconduct are of such a scale that they would not impact the outcome of an election that their investigation can be deferred, “that is not always the case.”

He said concerns that overt actions taken by the DOJ in this case are greatly minimized, since the voting has concluded.

He also said he has already authorized the DOJ to pursue substantial allegations of voting and voting tabulation irregularities in specific instances.

“Given this, and given that voting in our current elections has now concluded, I authorize you to pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections in your jurisdictions in certain cases, as I have already done in specific instances,” he said.

He said inquiries and reviews may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state.

“While U.S. Attorneys maintain their inherent authority to conduct inquiries and investigations as they deem appropriate, it will likely be prudent to commence any election-related matters as a preliminary inquiry, so as to assess whether available evidence warrants further investigative steps,” he said.

He also urged for the DOJ to exercise “great care and judgment’ and not launch inquiries on “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims.”

He noted that his authorization of investigations should not be taken as an indication that the DOJ has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of the election, but to ensure trust in the voting process.

“I provide this authority and guidance to emphasize the need to timely and appropriately address allegations of voting irregularities so that all of the American people, regardless of their preferred candidate or party, can have full confidence in the results of our elections,” he said.

“The American people and the leaders they freely elect deserve nothing less,” he said.

Earlier Monday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr issued a memo directing prosecutors to investigate potential voter fraud. He said that prosecutors should not, however, focus on “specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims.”

That was too much for Pilger, who resigned as director of the Election Crimes Branch of the department, the New York Times reported:

Mr. Pilger, a career prosecutor in the department’s Public Integrity Section who oversaw voting-fraud-related investigations, told colleagues he would move to a nonsupervisory role working on corruption prosecutions. “Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications,” he wrote, “I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch.” A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Pilger’s message.

Pilger felt few such qualms in 2010, when he pursued the theory that conservative groups could be prosecuted for misleading the IRS about their political activities. In an email included in a subsequent Senate report, Pilger wass described as prodding then-IRS Exempt Organizations director Lois Lerner about the idea, raised by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI):

[Pilger] wanted to know who at IRS the DOJ folks could talk to about Sen. Whitehouse [sic] idea at the hearing that DOJ could piece together false statement cases about applicants who “lied” on their 1024s–saying they weren’t planning on doing political activity, and then turning around and making large visible political expenditures. DOJ is feeling like it needs to respond, but want to talk to the right folks at IRS to see whether there are impediments from our side and what, if any damage this might do to IRS programs.

As the Wall Street Journal later noted:

Mr. Pilger was also a foot on the gas pedal during the IRS’s increased screening of conservative 501(c) groups. In 2010 he reached out to then IRS tax-exempt chief Lois Lerner about prosecuting nonprofits that engaged in political activity for making false statements on their tax returns. In an October 2010 email exchange, Ms. Lerner and Mr. Pilger discussed the transfer of data on 501(c) organizations. The Justice Department ended up with a database of 1.1 million documents, including protected taxpayer information.

Pilger’s resignation was described by the Times as a principled stand by a career official.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) stated that one of the reasons that re-electing Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is important is “Joe Biden has a 48-year history of selling out American workers and American jobs to China, to say nothing of his son’s shady dealings in China.” And both Perdue and Loeffler have been tough on China.

Cotton said, “China has been rooting for Joe Biden throughout this campaign. Because Joe Biden has a 48-year history of selling out American workers and American jobs to China, to say nothing of his son’s shady dealings in China. So, that’s another reason why we need to elect David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who have been tough on the Chinese Communist Party from the very beginning.”

Those three counties — Cobb, Fulton, and Gwinnett–accounted for 168,703 of Biden’s 221,751 vote margin gain, or 76 percent.

In 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Georgia by 211,141 votes, 2,089,104 to 1,877,963, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s election website.

With 99 percent of precincts reporting as of 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, November 9, Democratic nominee Joe Biden was leading Donald Trump by 10,610 votes, 2,466,540 to 2,455,930, according to Real Clear Politics.

This currently represents a 221,751 vote gain in margin of votes cast for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020 compared to the margin of votes cast for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The $15.8 million in “safe elections” grants these three counties in the Metropolitan Atlanta area–Fulton, Cobb, and Gwinnett- received from CTCL are a little more than four percent of the funding provided by Zuckerberg through CTCL to county and city election departments around the country in 2020.

“Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that he and his wife have donated an additional $100 million to a “safe elections” project run by the non-profit Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL), bringing their total contributions to that project to $350 million since September 1,” Breitbart News reported in October.

“Critics say the CTCL project’s grants look a lot more like Democratic “Get-out-the-Vote” (GOTV) efforts in major cities around the country than good government efforts to protect the integrity of the electoral process of all Americans, regardless of their party affiliation,” Breitbart News reported:

An analysis by the Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society suggests a [partisan element to the CTCL project]. Since September 1, 2020, the CTCL has made at least $63.7 million in grants to election commissions in 18 counties and two cities for what the CTCL calls the coronavirus “safe elections” project. More than 99.5 percent of this funding — $63.4 million — went to election commissions in 17 counties and two cities won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Less than one half of one percent of the funding — a mere $289,000 — went to a county Donald Trump won in 2016, Hays County, Texas, which the president barely won by a margin of 50.4 percent to 49.6 percent. A significant portion of these grants — more than $13.9 million — went to election commissions in areas Hillary Clinton won with more than 80 percent of the vote. Ten million dollars went to the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, which Clinton won with 84 percent of the vote, $3.5 million went to Wayne County, Michigan, which Clinton won with 96 percent of the vote, and $467,000 went to the election commission in the city of Flint, Michigan, which Clinton won with 84 percent of the vote.

In September, the Rome News-Tribune reported that Cobb County’s Election Department “was recently awarded a $5.6 million grant from a national nonprofit, the Center for Tech and Civic Life.”

The Center for Tech and Civic Life grant will help pay for: ♦ Almost 700 partitioned, secure voting system carriers to house the 2,258 ballot marking devices and optical scanners at all polling locations ♦ Hazard pay for roughly 2,300 workers at a rate of $100 per worker, per election. ♦ Additional temporary employees who will help prepare, process and tabulate absentee-by-mail ballots. ♦ Ballot mailing ♦ Advertising to promote absentee and early voting. (emphasis added)

Also in September, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Fulton County’s Election Department received “$6 million in a grant from the Center for Tech and Civic Life.”

In October, the Journal Constitution reported that Gwinnett County commissioners accepted a $4.1 million grant from CTCL “intended to be used for elections security.”

The grant is intended to be used for elections security and also allows the county to use some of the funds to cover costs from the June primary, county spokesman Joe Sorenson said. “We are currently evaluating where the funds will be sourced to,” Sorenson said.

In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton received 297,051 votes in Fulton County, compared to 117,783 for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 179, 268 for Hillary Clinton.

In Cobb County, Hillary Clinton received 160,121 votes compared to 152, 912 for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 7,209 for Hillary Clinton.

In Gwinnett County, Hillary Clinton received 166,153 votes compared to 146, 989 for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 19,164 for Hillary Clinton.

In those three counties combined, Hillary Clinton’s net vote margin over Donald Trump was 205,641. (Notably, in the rest of the state of Georgia, Donald Trump’s net vote margin over Hillary Clinton was 416,782.)

In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden received 379,095 votes in Fulton County, compared to 136,716 for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 242,379 votes for Joe Biden.

In Cobb County, Biden received 221,746 votes, compared to 165,195 for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 56,551 votes for Biden.

In Gwinnett County, Biden received 241,827 votes, compared to 166,413 votes for Donald Trump, a net vote margin of 75,414 votes for Biden.

In those three counties combined, Joe Biden’s net vote margin in 2020 over Donald Trump was 374,344, an increase of 168,703 over Hillary Clinton’s net vote margin of 205,641.

That 168,703 vote net margin increase for Biden in 2020 in the three counties that received $15.8 million in grants from the Zuckerberg-funded CTCL was 76 percent of the 221,751 net vote margin improvement for Biden that powered him to a 10,610 vote lead in Georgia with 99 percent of precincts reporting.

Between September 1, 2020 and October 30, 2020, the CTCL contributed more than $16.6 million for “safe elections” in six Georgia counties, as Ballotpedia reported.

All six counties voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Based on currently available public reports, it appears that no Georgia county that voted for Donald Trump in 2106 received a CTCL grant in 2020.

Breitbart News contacted CTCL and requested a list of all the counties in Georgia that received grants from CTCL in 2020, and specifically asked if CTCL provided grants to any county in the state that Donald Trump won in 2016, but has not yet received a response from CTCL.

In addition to the three metropolitan Atlanta counties of Cobb, Gwinnett, and Fulton, three counties outside of metropolitan Atlanta received CTCL grants in 2020.

Dougherty County, which received a $300,000 grant from CTCL, went overwhelmingly for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020, 69.6 percent to 29.6 percent. Biden’s net margin in the county was 24,579 votes, compared to Trump’s 10,449. a differential of 14,130 votes in favor of Biden.

The Macon-Bibb County Board of Elections, which administers elections for Macon County and Bibb County, received a $557,000 grant from CTCL. Both counties went overwhelmingly for Biden over Trump in 2020.

In Bibb County, Joe Biden received 61.4 percent of the vote to Donald Trump’s 37.6 percent. In terms of vote total, Biden received 43,460 votes while Trump received 26,583 votes, a margin of 16,887 for Biden. In the less populous Macon County, Biden received 2,857 votes compared to Trump’s 1,783, a net vote margin of 1,070 in favor of Biden."

McEnany said, “There is only one party in America trying to keep observers out of the count room, that party my friends is the Democrat party. You don’t take these positions because you want an honest election. You don’t oppose an audit of the vote because you want an accurate count. You don’t oppose our effort at sunlight at transparency because you have nothing to hide. You take these positions because you are a welcoming fraud and you are welcoming illegal voting.”

Cavuto said, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, I just think we have to be very clear. She’s charging the other side is welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal voting, unless she has more details to back that up, I can’t in good countenance continue showing you this.”

He continued, “I want to make sure that maybe they do have something back that up. That is an explosive charge to make at the other side is effectively rigging and cheating. If she does bring proof of that we will take you back.”

He added, “So far, she started saying right at the outset welcoming fraud, welcoming illegal voting, not so fast.”

Full interview here >>> https://t.co/y0mqvHZiZ7 #GASen pic.twitter.com/k6oSv4JJMU

During an interview with Gray DC on Monday, Georgia Democratic senatorial candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock responded to a question on whether he supports court-packing by saying that “it’s presumptuous” of him to discuss “what ought to happen with the courts.”

In response to a question on whether he supports packing the court or statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico, Warnock said, “I think that they’re [Republicans] trying to divide us, again, and it’s really sad. Because, at the end of the day, E Pluribus Unum, out of many, one, that’s the covenant that we have with one another, as an American people. I support that. I believe in that with all of my heart. And I’m going to stand up and defend it.”

After being asked again if he supports expanding the Supreme Court, Warnock responded, “I’m really focused on representing the concerns of ordinary people here in Georgia. I think it’s presumptuous for me to go further down that path, talking about what ought to happen with the courts. I’m hopeful that the people of Georgia will look at my life, look at my record, and give me the great honor of representing them in the United States Senate.”

Jesse Jacob, who could face legal penalty if her accusations are not true, leveled several claims against her employer.

“I processed absentee ballot packages to be sent to voters while I worked at the election headquarters in September 2020 along with 70-80 other poll workers,” she said.

“I was instructed by my supervisor to adjust the mailing date of these absentee ballot packages to be dated earlier than they were actually sent. The supervisor was making announcements for all workers to engage in this practice.”

Jacob said she worked at a polling location leading up to the election where voters could cast absentee ballots in person.

I directly observed, on a daily basis, City of Detroit election workers and employees coaching and trying to coach voters to vote for Joe Biden and the Democrat party. I witnessed these workers and employees encouraging voters to do a straight Democrat ballot. I witnessed these election workers and employees going over to the voting booths with voters in order to watch them vote and coach them for whom to vote.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s website stated it is a requirement to have a photo ID, such as a Michigan’s driver’s license or identification card, to vote. Those not possessing an ID must “sign a brief affidavit stating that they’re not in possession of a photo ID.”

During the last two weeks while working at this satellite location, I was specifically instructed by my supervisor not to ask for a driver’s license or any photo I.D. when a person was trying to vote. I observed a large number of people who came to the satellite location to vote in-person, but they had already applied for an absentee ballot. These people were allowed to vote in-person and were not required to return the mailed absentee ballot or sign an affidavit that the voter lost the mailed absentee ballot.

Jacob said she then worked at the TCF Center in Downtown Detroit to tabulate absentee ballots:

Absentee ballots that were received in the mail would have the voter’s signature on the envelope. While I was at the TCF Center, I was instructed not to look at any of the signatures on the absentee ballots, and I was instructed not to compare the signature on the absentee ballot with the signature on file.

When asked to respond to Jacob’s allegations, Benson’s director of communications and external affairs, Jake Rollow, told Breitbart News, “Michigan’s election results are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters. Any meritless suggestion to the contrary denigrates the tens of thousands of election clerks and workers who served — with integrity and under intense scrutiny — to provide Michigan citizens with a secure, transparent and accessible election process.”

He did not answer whether Benson would open an investigation into the claims.

Jacob’s allegations are part of a lawsuit filed by Wayne County residents Cheryl A. Constatino and Edward P. McCall, Jr. against the City of Detroit and Detroit Election Commission, Detroit City Clerk Janice M. Winfrey, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers.

Michigan talk radio host Steve Gruber noted the fraud was committed “at the behest of Detroit and Wayne County officials and included changing legal names and dates on ballots, ballot harvesting, voter intimidation and more. It also claims the effort to defraud voters began in early September.”

Donald Trump’s Knee Is Off Your Neck’","Dahleen Glanton, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, published an article Monday in which she likened President Donald Trump to the Minneapolis, Minnesota, police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck in an infamous fatal encounter.

Though Minneapolis is a Democrat-run city, and Trump immediately condemned Floyd’s death, Glanton portrayed Trump as a symbol of American racism:

You stand bruised and unsteady, uncertain about what the future holds. Though you are rejoicing in the streets, you are not sure the ordeal is over. Other times you thought he was defeated, he prevailed more emboldened than before. Rather than loosening the grip on your neck, he pressed down harder and harder. … He thought he had convinced you that living with a knee pinned to your neck is not as bad as some make it out to be. He thought that you would be content to remain under duress four more years if he dangled a few distortions in your face. He claimed responsibility for a growing economy that began thriving under Barack Obama. He offered you the freedom not to wear a mask, knowing that it would allow COVID-19 to flourish. He promised you a speedy return to normal. But the pandemic has created a new normal in America, and it is nothing like the past.

Glanton went on to say that Trump’s voters had chosen to “stay where they were,” i.e. with a knee on their necks.

Trump won more than one in four votes cast by minorities — the best result for any Republican presidential candidate since 1960.

Emanuel, the brother of President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is known for his role in designing Obamacare. Once mocked as “Dr. Death” in debates over the rationing of end-of-life care, Emanuel wrote in 2014 that “living too long” was a state to be avoided.

As Breitbart News noted in April:

Emanuel has had a longtime and controversial fascination with healthcare rationing, writing scores of papers over the years on the ethics of allocating medical resources to a population. He is also a hyper-partisan champion of progressive policies that have sought to fundamentally transform the U.S. economy and healthcare system. He once wrote a piece titled, “Why I Hope to Die at 75.” In the 2014 Atlantic article, Emanuel made clear that he was serious about his wish to die at 75 and even argued that “living too long is also a loss.” Emanuel wrote: I am sure of my position. Doubtless, death is a loss. It deprives us of experiences and milestones, of time spent with our spouse and children. In short, it deprives us of all the things we value. But here is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic. Emanuel posited that “for many reasons, 75 is a pretty good age to aim to stop.”

Biden will be 78 if he is inaugurated in January.

12,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/11/09/biden-calls-bold-action-novel-coronavirus-while-offering-few-specifics/,Biden Urges 'Bold' Acts to Fight Coronavirus While Offering Few Specifics,"Former Vice President Joe Biden argued on Monday that “bold action” was required to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic over the next few months, but stopped short of offering specific recommendations.

Biden, who made President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic central to his White House bid this election cycle, made the comments at a press conference in Wilmington, Delaware, when announcing the members of his coronavirus advisory task force. Although the event mainly served as an introduction to the 13-medical professionals that will council the former vice president on the outbreak, Biden took a few moments during the press conference to discuss the “immense challenge” before him.

“Although we are not in office yet, I’m just laying out what we expect to do and hope that can be done, some of it, between now and the time we’re sworn in,” the former vice president said. “There is a need for bold action to fight this pandemic.”

“We’re still facing a very dark winter,” Biden added. “There are now nearly 10 million COVID [coronavirus] cases in the United States … infection rates are going up, hospitalizations are going up, and deaths are going up.”

The former vice president proceeded to argue that while there was hope on the horizon, especially with Pfizer announcing on Monday that it developed a vaccine that was shown to be 90 percent effective at combatting the coronavirus in clinical trials, the coming months would be difficult, nonetheless.

“We can’t forgo the important work that needs to be down between now and then to get our country through the worst wave yet in this pandemic,” he said.

During the press conference, which lasted less than 11-minutes and was not open to questions from the media, Biden did not offer any new proposals for the “bold action” that would be required to prevent the spread of the virus. In fact, only at the end of the event did the former vice president broach a specific recommendation for how to stop the spread of the virus. Even that point — that people should continue wearing masks and practice social distancing, though, was made in a larger political context about needing to end the “politicization of basic responsible public health steps.”

Biden’s ambiguous calls for “bold action” came after thousands of his supporters crowded cities across the country over the weekend to celebrate media outlets calling the 2020 presidential contests in favor of the Democrat ticket. The crowds were visible on the streets of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, among other major urban areas during both Saturday and Sunday.

While most of the participants appeared to be wearing masks, few seemed to be following the social distancing guidelines suggested by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to prevent the spread of the outbreak. The CDC, in particular, has warned individuals, especially those at high-risk for the virus, to avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least a distance of six feet. In some instances, the coronavirus has also been found to be airborne and linger “for minutes to hours,” and as such, individuals have been told to exercise caution — even in outdoor environments with proper ventilation.

More troubling, apart from violating social distancing guidelines, is that some members of the crowds were seen sharing beverages in celebration of the media labeling Biden president-elect. The conservative-leaning Federalist captured such a moment in front of the White House on Saturday, with individuals taking turns drinking from a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne.

The former vice president, however, did not address such actions during his remarks on Monday. Instead, Biden chose to broadly urge Americans to put aside political differences and “wear a mask” for the foreseeable future.

“The election is over. … I won’t be president until January 20, but my message today is to everyone,” Biden said. “It doesn’t matter who you voted … we can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months.”"
13,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/11/09/fda-approves-eli-lilly-coronavirus-antibody-treatment-emergency-use/,FDA Approves Eli Lilly Coronavirus Antibody Treatment for Emergency Use,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Eli Lilly’s coronavirus antibody treatment for emergency use.

The monoclonal antibody treatment, called bamlanivimab, is targeted at adults and children over the age of 12 with mild to moderate illness but who are at risk of hospitalization, according to the FDA’s letter of authorization.

The therapy is also meant for people with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, or anyone over the age of 65.

The FDA’s authorization expands doctors’ ability to use the Eli Lilly treatment outside of clinical trials.

The drug company applied for emergency use authorization in October after it said that research suggested the antibody treatment could help keep coronavirus patients from reaching the point of hospitalization.

The FDA’s authorization “provides health care professionals on the frontline of this pandemic with another potential tool in treating Covid-19 [coronavirus] patients,” Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

Bamlanivimab is similar to Regeneron’s experimental antibody cocktail, which President Donald Trump took while he was hospitalized for the coronavirus at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

However, the FDA states that the emergency use authorization does not apply to already hospitalized patients or for people who have trouble breathing.

Bamlanivimab is given intravenously in a single dose. In safety studies of approximately 800 people, the drug led to a severe allergic reaction in one person who needed epinephrine to stop it.

The FDA said other side effects of the drug include dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, itching, headache, and vomiting.

Eli Lilly has already begun manufacturing the drug and said it expects to have one million doses ready by the end of the year."
14,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/11/09/thousands-protest-against-socialism-argentina/,Thousands Protest Against Socialism in Argentina,"Anti-socialist demonstrations took place across Argentina this weekend against the administration of socialist President Alberto Fernández, whose management has led to a severe economic crisis.

The largest protest took place in Buenos Aires, where thousands of people surrounded the obelisk in the central square shouting “freedom, justice, and the constitution.” Drivers honked their horns in support, while inflatable dolls of Fernández and Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner were on full display. Inflatable dolls of politicians wearing prison uniforms, known as pixulecos, originated in neighboring Brazil, where protests attracting millions preceded the impeachment and removal of socialist ex-President Dilma Rousseff in 2016.

One of the principal concerns of those in attendance is the state of the country’s struggling economy, currently in the midst of another hyperinflation crisis fueling soaring rates of unemployment. With prices rising on almost a daily basis and the government restricting citizens’ access to U.S. dollars, many Argentines are cashing in their life savings at black-market prices just to ensure they do not lose everything.

Another concern prompting the protests is the alleged plan the government has to purchase 10 million doses of Russian manufactured coronavirus vaccine candidates, despite many experts expressing doubt over both the safety and efficacy of the product.

Protesters also opposed the government’s plans to introduce judicial reforms that will protect Fernández de Kirchner, herself a former president, from future prosecution in the yet-unresolved case of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, found dead of an alleged “suicide” in January 2015. Nisman was to testify before Congress the day after his death that he had evidence Fernández de Kirchner protected those responsible for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, including both Iranian officials and ties to Hezbollah. Police found a draft warrant for Fernández de Kirchner in Nisman’s trash following his death. No one has been arrested or prosecuted in relation to the Nisman case at press time.

These are the second nationwide demonstrations held within the space of a month. Similar protests occurred last month over issues including the government’s draconian lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus. Despite the strict measures, the country has recorded over 1.2 million coronavirus cases, the second-highest figure in Latin America and the seventh-highest worldwide. As governments self-report coronavirus cases, these rankings are skewed by rogue states such as China, Russia, Venezuela, and Iran posting numbers that experts — including experts in these countries — have questioned.

Leftists protests also took place this weekend against the eviction of largely homeless families and squatters living in improvised shacks at the Guernica encampment in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

According to the Buenos Aires Times, some 4,000 police officers were deployed to storm the area in the early hours of the morning, “tearing down the shacks and miserable refuges of wood and plastic which were then set ablaze in scenes that sparked panic and fury among the temporary residents.”

“The evicted resisted the raid with stones and other projectiles while the police fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas in clashes lasting several hours,” the Times added.

Tensions have risen across Argentina since December last year when Fernández won the presidential elections over the incumbent president Mauricio Macri. With the collapsing economy and increasing social unrest, some commentators have speculated that the country may be going in the same direction as socialist Venezuela, currently experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in its history.

15,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/09/erdogans-son-law-resigns-turkeys-finance-minister/,Erdogan’s Son-in-Law Resigns as Turkey’s Finance Minister,"Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak resigned from his post on Sunday citing health reasons, one day after Ankara fired its central bank chief.

Albayrak is the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who fired central bank governor Murat Uysal on Saturday. Erdoğan replaced Uysal with former Finance Minister Naci Agbal, whose policies are believed to be at odds with those of Albayrak.

The personnel shuffle comes as Turkey battles an economic crisis that began in 2018 and grew worse under the leadership of Albayrak as finance minister, observers say. Turkey endured a currency crisis in 2018 followed by a recession. Its weakened economy was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic at the start of this year. Since then, the Turkish lira has lost 30 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

“After serving in ministerial posts for nearly five years, I took the decision not to continue my duty [as finance minister] due to health issues,” Albayrak said in a statement posted to his Instagram account on Sunday. He became Turkey’s finance minister in 2018 after serving as the country’s energy minister from 2015-2o18.

Officials at Turkey’s Finance Ministry confirmed Albayrak’s resignation, according to Turkish broadcaster HaberTurk.

Turkey’s president must accept a government minister’s resignation for it to be finalized. It is not yet known if Erdoğan will accept his son-in-law’s resignation. Albayrak, 42, is married to the president’s elder daughter, Esra.

After Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu resigned in April, Erdoğan rejected the resignation. The president judged that it was not “appropriate” for Soylu to resign and insisted that the minister would continue in his position. Soylu remains in his post as interior minister today.

Uysal was terminated by presidential decree on Saturday after serving as governor of Turkey’s central bank for 16 months. His predecessor, Murat Cetinkaya, was also ousted by presidential decree in July 2019.

“The Turkish lira on Monday gained value as the new central bank governor assumed the charge. The US dollar/Turkish lira exchange rate was down by around 4 percent versus Friday’s close,” Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported.

Agbal stressed the “decisive use of all policy tools in pursuit of price stability objective,” in a statement on Monday.

“The monetary policy communication will be strengthened in the framework of transparency, accountability, and predictability principles,” Agbal said."

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, and Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter spoke about the subject during a virtual press conference Monday afternoon.

“We have constantly reminded the American people that we represent and stand up for the rule of law,” Landry, the chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association, said. “As such, we believe the voting system should be free of outside, undue influence.”

Landry compared President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential race to “referees getting to change the rules midway through the football game.”

“We believe that’s exactly what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did,” Landry said.

Schmitt, who was instrumental in bringing this brief forward, said the attorneys general filed this brief Monday “seeking the Supreme Court to take the Pennsylvania case and then reverse the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision.”

In the brief, Schmitt said they highlighted the issue of “separation of powers,” specifically to state legislatures “granting time, place, and manner” for their state’s frameworks.

Schmitt said the state Supreme Court “overstepped” its bounds when dealing with the state legislature.

Schmitt also said the brief dealt with “election integrity,” and called mail-in ballots the “most likely form of fraud.”

He then cited a recent case in Missouri where a local official was indicted for ballot fraud.

Hunter called the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s actions “one of the most breathtaking abuses of judicial authority.”

He then explained that the group as attorneys general had a responsibility to “address that kind of abuse of judicial authority” because it can affect election outcomes not just in Pennsylvania but nationwide.

“We are seeking the Supreme Court to take this case,” Schmitt said. “We think this is a very, very important case.”

Before the election, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it would allow mail-in ballots to be counted post-Election Day without evidence of a postmark. The state Supreme Court also ruled before the election that ballots cannot be tossed over a mismatched signature."

Brennan said, “You can do a lot of damage in 70 days. He’s still the president of the United States. And is he going to carry out these vendettas against other individuals? As you pointed out, Chris Wray or Gina Haspel or others. It is clear Donald Trump is trying to exercise the power because he can. And he is going to settle scores. But I’m very concerned what he might do in his remaining 70 days in office. Is he going to take some type of military action? Is he going to release some type of information that could, in fact, threaten our national security interests? I think people need to be looking very carefully at what he’s doing. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress continue to give Donald Trump a pass.”

Anchor Chris Cuomo asked, “What can be done to stop anything he wants to do in the next 70 days?”

Brennan said, “Well, if Vice President Pence and the cabinet had an ounce of fortitude and spine and patriotism, I think they would seriously consider invoking the 25th Amendment and pushing Donald Trump out because he is just very unpredictable now. He’s like a cornered cat, tiger, and he’s going to lash out. And the fact again that he has the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome. We know that Attorney General Barr has done Donald Trump’s bidding in the past. Will he continue to do that vis-a-vis this election? I don’t know, but I do think it’s something that the members of Congress, the leadership of the Republican Party, really needs to send clear signals to Donald Trump that if he continues to go along this path, they are going to put up roadblocks.”

Emanuel, the lead author on a paper in Science called “An ethical framework for global vaccine allocation,” argued that there should be a “fair international distribution of vaccine,” rather than what he and his co-authors call “vaccine nationalism.”

“Reasonable national partiality does not permit retaining more vaccine than the amount needed to keep the rate of transmission (Rt) below 1, when that vaccine could instead mitigate substantial COVID-19–related harms in other countries that have been unable to keep Rt below 1 through ongoing public-health efforts,” Emanuel and his co-authors write.

He and his co-authors reject a proposal by the World Health Organization (WHO) to distribute vaccines proportionally, with “with 3% of each country’s population receiving vaccines” and allocation up to 20% of the population in every country.

They also reject a proposal to prevent the highest number of deaths by giving vaccines to countries based on “the number of frontline health care workers, the proportion of population over 65, and the number of people with comorbidities.”

The problem with that approach, Emanuel argues, is that death is not the only form of harm, and prioritizing older people would mean sending a disproportionate share of vaccines to rich countries, where average life expectancies are longer.

The Fair Priority Model, Emanuel and his co-authors argue, focuses on preventing premature death; on preventing the harms caused by school and business closures; and on reducing community transmission of the virus in the population in general.

They introduce a complicated formula, acknowledging that it “will require approximations as well as judgments,” such as estimates of the precise effect of each dose of vaccine on the “poverty gap” in each country. The authors claim that countries will not “exaggerate” the severity of the pandemic to receive more vaccines, because that would hurt economic activity.

Emanuel is regarded as one of the key architects of Obamacare, and wrote a controversial article 2014,”Why I Hope to Die at 75.”

Pfizer announced Monday that a vaccine it was developing with German drugmaker BioNTech was 90% effective.

The company claimed, incorrectly, that it had not participated in President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” (it boasted of its involvement in July). It has a $2 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million doses — with an option to deliver 500 million more. Americans will receive the vaccine for free, thanks to the administration’s policy.

Emanuel is also the brother of President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel.

After playing a montage of De Niro’s most infamous mobsters characters, Melber said, “What do we take from all the tough guys you have played and thinking about this is a country that celebrates toughness but sometimes gets carried away with mafia movies.”

De Niro said, “Of course I’m an actor. I do the parts. I enjoy them. But I’d like to even think in all of those parts there’s a certain dignity. Somewhere buried in there. That I don’t think a person like Trump I know doesn’t have. There’s no center. You have to have a center no matter who you are. It is just it’s like somebody defying gravity. They’ll never do. That’s why we have rules and laws. We have judges. We have structure. If we don’t have that, we have nothing. We have chaos. We have anarchy.”

He continued, “We need someone to lead us through in a kind of father figure way or mother figure way. To bring us through and show that they love us, care about us, and want our best. They are looking out for us. It’s the total opposite with someone like him. It confounds me how he ever got to be elected. He did. Crazy things happen. That’s what we need in a leader. In any leader. That’s what we were going to get with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”

He added, “I’m not like political, but I was so angry and so enraged and confounded that he would actually behave the way he did and that people bought it.”

He concluded, “I now I see many many many people in the country feel this way. I’m sad about other people who don’t. They are accepted him and would have voted for him and have voted for him. I don’t know why. That’s all that it was from the very beginning. How could this guy behave this way? That’s all.”

“FDT” reemerged on Saturday, shortly taking the status as the most played song on iTunes. According to Billboard, people downloaded the anti-Trump anthem “3,000 times, according to initial sales reports to Nielsen Music/MRC Data, a 740% gain over the song’s sales count on Nov. 6.”

Per Billboard:

The sales boosts of “FDT” actually began on Nov. 3, the day of the presidential election, the results of which were drawn out over multiple days due to the closeness of the vote tallies between Biden and President Donald Trump in a variety of states. In the four days preceding Nov. 7 (Nov. 3-6), the song scored 2,000 downloads, up 233% from the previous four-day period (Oct. 30-Nov. 2).

The death-threat laced song, which features the late Nipsey Hussle, compares Trump to Adolf Hitler and includes the following lyrics:

Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump

Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump I got a question

How’d he make it this far? How the fuck did it begin?

A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin

Or KKK shit, now I’m goin’ in I’m just sayin’ what’s real, I don’t give a fuck who I offend

‘Cause it’s gotta be said, it’s gotta be said

It’s off the top like the toupee on Donald Trump’s head

This man’s not peaceful, racism’s evil

This man hates Muslims, that’s a billion fuckin’ people

If truth be told, Donald is a terrorist

The explicit nature of the song prompted Secret Service to launch an investigation following its release in 2016.

“Secret Service hollering at the label,” YG complained at the time. “They asked to see the lyrics on my album to see if I’m talking about Trump on my album, because if I’m talking about him on my album they’re going to try and take it off the shelves.”

The rapper suggested that the song was part of a greater effort to “motivate the young people to vote.”

Following the media’s announcement, The Voice host John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen shared a video of themselves dancing to the graphic anthem.

Notably, the election news also thrust Miley Cyrus’s 2009 hit “Party in USA” into the spotlight, reclaiming its status on U.S. iTunes’ top 200 list.

However, what Mike Tyson recently admitted to doing certainly takes things to the next level.

On a recent edition of his podcast, Hotboxin,’ the former heavyweight champion hosted UFC Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novitzky. During their conversation, Tyson revealed that he used a “whizzinator,” a prosthetic penis normally filled with someone else’s clean urine, to pass drug tests.

“It was awesome, man,” Tyson said. “I put my baby’s urine in it. And sometimes, one time I was using my wife’s and my wife was like ‘Baby you better not hope that it comes back pregnant or something.’ And I said, ‘Nah, so we ain’t gonna use you any more, we’re gonna use the kid.’”

Tyson prided himself on being a clean fighter during his career. Though, his fondness for recreational drugs is known. Tyson is currently training for an exhibition bout against former four-division World Champion Roy Jones Jr. at Staples Center in Los Angeles."

According to the Global Times, China’s heavily censored internet is swimming with flashbacks to Biden’s visit to Yao’s Chao Gan restaurant:

Many netizens posted old pictures of Biden dining in the restaurant on Sina Weibo, urging the shop to roll out the order as the “President Package,” which was previously known as the “Biden Set.” This included five bowls of black bean sauce noodles, 10 steamed buns, smashed cucumber salad, mountain yam salad, shredded potatoes and Coca-Cola, media reported. Others urged people to order something from the special restaurant on this special occasion. Yao Long, owner of the restaurant located in the historical center of Beijing, referred to Biden as “an old friend,” although he can only vaguely recall the day Biden made a sudden visit to his restaurant, as it was too long ago. “I sincerely congratulate him on being elected US president, as he once was a guest in our restaurant,” Yao said. But not every Chinese liked Biden’s down-to-earth move at the time, which some observers thought was cheap as it had clear purpose to touch Chinese people, who were not familiar with American-style democracy. Observers noted that such a trick will not wash with Chinese people any longer.

Other “enthusiastic Chinese netizens” quoted by the Global Times recalled Biden “watching a basketball match, bringing his Chinese-learning granddaughter to China and visiting suffering people from then earthquake-stricken Sichuan Province.” They said they admired his “history of battling adversity,” including overcoming family tragedies and failing at two previous presidential runs before he “finally claimed the crown at the senior age of 78.”

The Global Times followed this up with the usual officially-endorsed dour predictions that Biden’s election would not significantly improve U.S.-China relations. As one Chinese academic put it, “we should not put too much expectation on Biden, because to contain and confront China is a strategic consensus between the two parties of the U.S.”

The most downbeat analysts quoted by the Chinese Communist paper grumbled that Biden’s “noodle diplomacy” was just a “cheap trick” to fool the Chinese people, asserting that “such a trick will not wash with Chinese people any longer.”

The Global Times made room for a bit more optimism on Sunday, predicting Biden’s return to conventional international politics could repair some of the “destruction” caused by the maverick Trump.

“China can expect more negotiation room with the U.S. and Europe after Biden takes office, but competition and toughness may come to China under close transatlantic relations,” analyst Zhou Hong of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted.

Zhou expected the Western world to give China fewer problems once Donald Trump’s stubborn criticism is replaced with noodle diplomacy:

China should prepare for a tough Europe and a tough US, but there is no need to be afraid. Germany once hoped to gain more influence over the South China Sea. Perhaps the US and Europe will talk tough on the South China Sea issue in the future, but it will go no further than that, and Europe will not participate in actual military exercises, Zhou noted. Other observers also doubted how much Europe would cooperate with the US to play the geopolitics card to contain China, as the major mission for Europeans, facing the COVID-19 pandemic, is to curb the virus and resume economy, for which they would need badly to cooperate with China. Other issues such as the values and human rights are less likely to be used by the West to attack China following the pandemic and the terrorist attacks in some European countries including France. Chinese people have built strong confidence in the country’s system given the Chinese government’s performance in the epidemic and China’s development in the past years, observers noted.

On Monday, the Global Times predicted a Biden walkback from Trump’s insistence on a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” noting that the region was not even mentioned in the 2020 Democratic Party platform.

The Global Times expected Biden to return to a more China-friendly Asia-Pacific strategy, possibly even reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or “some other forms of regional economic and trade mechanisms which exclude China.”

“In face of U.S. economic encirclement, China can show the region its stance and policy ideas on globalization and free trade, and enhance efforts to promote integration with regional countries including US allies and partners. It can also accelerate promoting regional mechanisms such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with ASEAN,” the article suggested, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

“This may lead to several closed multilateral mechanisms comprised of different groupings of countries, but China and the U.S. will play key roles in these mechanisms,” the Global Times wrote, essentially proposing that a Biden return to internationalism would make it impossible for the U.S. to contain China in any meaningful sense.

The article concluded by predicting that America might continue its “muscle-flexing in the Asia-Pacific region” – an allusion to the U.S. Navy’s Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP) in waters claimed illegally by Beijing – but they would no longer pose a serious strategic impediment to Chinese ambitions because, without Trump, smaller Asian nations would no longer see the United States as a reliable backer in economic or military confrontations with the Chinese superpower.

“China, based on its diplomatic principles, can work on boosting ties with Belt and Road countries to expand its circle of friends to offset the US strategic pressure,” the Global Times advised.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is China’s international infrastructure project, denounced by the Trump administration as a malign project to spread Chinese influence through the Third World and dominate smaller nations by trapping them with huge loans from Chinese banks.

Some of Trump’s critics insist he never made much progress in bringing ASEAN together against the rising Chinese hegemon, accusing him of investing little more than rhetoric in the effort, while others thought ASEAN might be even more eager to confront and contain China than Trump, as evidenced by their support for U.S. engagement in the region even when the U.S.-China trade war was costing them money.

The Chinese analysts cited by the Global Times appear convinced that a return to the Obama administration’s approach will leave everyone with little choice but doing business with China – which, for all of its lip service about globalism and “win-win cooperation,” was practicing China First foreign policy long before Donald Trump advocated America First, and will continue practicing China First long after Joe Biden has an opportunity to put America First to bed."

On Wednesday, the country’s Interior Ministry said it was rescinding its agreement, dated October 7, asserting it was “not in accord with the interests of the State of Guatemala.”

A report at Catholic News Agency (CNA) stated:

Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei announced the repeal Nov. 2, declaring he would not allow Planned Parenthood to operate in the country. Giammattei’s response was in reaction [to] the initial agreement authorizing Planned Parenthood, which became official that same day.

“I recognize life from conception and therefore I will not tolerate in my administration any movement that violates what is established in our Political Constitution of the Republic, that goes against the values with which I was raised and that conflicts with my principles as doctor,” Giammattei said.

The president emphasized that he is “a faithful defender of life.”

“I am emphatic in stating that I will not endorse in my administration the creation, registration or start-up of any organization that goes against life,” he asserted.

Planned Parenthood states on its website its partner organization Planned Parenthood Global joins with local groups in Guatemala “to increase access to health information and services, including birth control, as well as improve maternal mortality and unsafe abortion rates.”

“We promote community engagement to change the social, legal, and political climate to equate sexual and reproductive rights with human rights,” the abortion provider adds.

CNA reported Oliverio Garcia Rodas, Guatemala’s interior minister, resigned following the decision to scrap the agreement with Planned Parenthood.

""If Black Lives Matter is really serious about black lives, then they should advocate for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which is far, far more responsible for the destruction of black lives than any other organization that I can think of."" pic.twitter.com/FR69fqqPg3 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) June 13, 2020

“Oliverio García Rodas, taking responsibility, informed me in the evening that he had made the decision to resign due to the error he had committed and considering that it was strongly opposed,” Giammattei told journalists.

“I reiterate the government’s commitment to respect life from conception, since it is something that my faith and the Political Constitution of the Republic profess,” the president added.

Pro-life advocates expressed gratitude to Giammattei “for his firm statement,” and for protecting “the lives of Guatemalans from conception, as established in our Magna Carta.”"

Officials said the drugs had an estimated street value of more than $60 million.

Office of Field Operations officers assigned to the World Trade Bridge observed a 1999 Freightliner tract0r-trailer approaching from Mexico for entry into the U.S. on October 28. Officers referred the driver to a secondary inspection area for a K-9 and non-intrusive imaging system inspection, according to information obtained from CBP officials.

After an initial screening, officers carried out a physical inspection and discovered 352 packages of drugs hidden in the shipment of frozen vegetables. The officers tested the drug and identified it as 1,049.84 pounds of methamphetamine. Officials estimated the value of the shipment at nearly $21 million.

On October 27, OFO officers assigned to the Colombia-Solidarity Bridge observed a tractor hauling an alleged empty trailer approaching from Mexico. The officers referred the driver to the secondary inspection station for a K-9 and non-intrusive inspection. The officers conducted a physical inspection of 618 packages of drugs.

The officers identified the drugs as methamphetamine. The 1,988.12 pounds shipment has an estimated street value of nearly $40 million, officials stated.

In total, the officers at the two ports of entry seized 3.037 pounds of methamphetamine in two days. The combined seizures have an estimated street value of $60,758,775.

Officers seized both tractor-trailer rigs and turned the cases over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations special agents for further investigation.

“We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate vote count,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said during a press conference on Monday at the Republican National Committee.

McEnany said she was speaking in her personal capacity as an adviser to the campaign and not as the White House press secretary.

She urged patience from corporate media outlets while the campaign worked to tabulate and canvas the votes.

“What we are asking for right now is patience as we explore these equal protection claims among others,” she said.

McEnany cited past complaints from Republicans in Pennsylvania of poll watchers being barred from observing the ballot counts. She also accused the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of disregarding the Constitution by making decisions about the rules of the election, when that authority was constitutionally up to the state legislature.

McEnany was joined by Trump Campaign Counsel Matt Morgan, and Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel spoke about the Republican effort at a press conference at the RNC headquarters in Washington, DC.

Morgan detailed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania, arguing that Democrat counties in Philadelphia extended special privileges to voters in their counties but not in similar counties for Republicans

He also said that 682,000 ballots were tabulated outside the view of Republican poll observers, during the election counting process.

“We believe that a meaningful review of those ballots could discern that there were ballots that were illegally counted,” he said.

He said that the results should be tabulated and canvassed before the Pennsylvania Secretary of State certified the election results.

McDaniel detailed new lawsuits in Michigan, accusing poll workers in Michigan of voting irregularities in Wayne County. She also cited the widely circulated reports of poll workers locking doors and putting cardboard on windows to keep Republican voting observers from seeing the ballot counts.

“Obviously, that’s not going to instill confidence,” she said.

C-SPAN

McDaniel also spoke about a Detroit election worker whistleblower who was told to backdate ballots so they would meet the deadline for counting the vote. She said the whistleblower even observed poll workers coaching voters to help people vote for Joe Biden, even in voting booths.

She said that 131 affidavits had been completed in Michigan out of 2800 incident reports and that two new lawsuits had been filed in the state.

McDaniel also condemned reports of poll workers in Michigan who cheered and applauded as election observers were removed from observing the counting process.

“We will not give up on this process until every last issue has been uncovered,” she said.

McEnany denounced the Democrat party for refusing to support voter ID, signature verification, proof of citizenship, or residency to vote.

“You don’t take these positions because you want an honest election,” she said, noting that Democrats were “welcoming fraud” in America’s elections and “welcoming illegal voting.”

“We are fighting for the rights of all Americans who want to have faith and confidence in this election but in the many elections to come,” she said.

A transcript is as follows:

MARK LEVIN: The state’s legislature determine how to select their elections. Is that what the [Constitution section] means?

KEN STARR: That’s exactly what it means. It got lost in the Pennsylvania shuffle. The founding generation sitting in Philadelphia undoubtedly thought, “Well, should we have the state Supreme Court make the determination?” No, we want … a very democratic with a small “d” approach. We want the legislatures, those closest to the people, the state legislatures, they’re the bosses, not the governor. And what happened in Pennsylvania over these recent weeks is a constitutional travesty. Governor Wolf tries to get his reforms, his vision, as he was entitled to do, through the legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He failed. He then goes to the state Supreme Court, which by a divided vote, accepted the substance of what Governor Wolf was doing, and then added thereon nooks and crannies as well."
38,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/09/migration-hawk-chuck-grassley-to-run-senates-immigration-committee/,Migration Hawk Chuck Grassley to Run Senate’s Immigration Committee,"Amnesty advocate Sen. Lindsey Graham is giving up his chairmanship of the Senate’s immigration committee to lead the budget panel, as Sen. Chuck Grassley uses his seniority to retake the committee chair.

The planned switch is good news for Americans, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

“If the [judiciary] committee that is in charge of immigration matters is overseen by Grassley, that’s much improved from the perspective of immigration control [advocates], because Grassley is much more hawkish than Graham,” Krikorian told Breitbart. “Graham was part of the Gang of Eight [2013 amnesty], and even if he has changed his spots to Lindsey Graham 2.0, he is still not an immigration hawk in any meaningful way.”

Graham has just won reelection because of a huge turnout of populist voters who oppose Graham’s prior support for amnesty and visa worker giveaways. President Donald Trump’s populist turnout gave Graham 55 percent of the vote, even though Graham’s opponent spent roughly $100 million on the campaign.

Politico reported November 5:

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is set to return to the Senate Judiciary Committee, after giving up the gavel for two years to chair the Finance Committee. The current chairman of Judiciary, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), is presumed to helm the Senate Budget Committee. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), meanwhile, is in line to replace Grassley on Finance while Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is expected to take over the Banking Committee from Crapo.

The chairmanships are important because the GOP’s Senate caucus is governed by its own unwritten rules, said Krikorian. “The Senate is a club, even today, and much of its work is based on collegiality and mutual dealmaking, so the chairmanship would give Grassley — as a practical matter – a kind of [informal] veto over bad immigration bills” that must pass through the committee before a floor vote, he said.

“It is not an absolute veto: If the Republican leadership was completely committed to passing a bad immigration bill, and if they had a majority of GOP Senators, they could steamroll the chairman … [but it is] not very likely,” he said.

Grassley would still be influential if the GOP loses its Senate majority following the two run-off votes in January, Krikorian said.

Grassley is also a noted critic of the H-1B worker pipelines.

In 2021, Democrats are likely to revive their various amnesty and cheap labor bills.

For example, the Democrats’ coronavirus-emergency bill — the HEROES Act — includes several amnesties for illegals and creates new inflows of foreign healthcare workers.

The H.R. 1044, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, would dramatically expand the incentives for college graduate Indian migrants to accept visa worker contracts in the United States."

Joe Manchin (D-WV) vowed that he will not vote for packing the courts or ending the filibuster if Democrats take the majority in the Senate. Manchin also expressed opposition to defunding the police, Medicare for all, and the Green New Deal.

Manchin discussed the possibility of a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Democrats holding the majority due to the vice president breaking the tie. Manchin stated that if this is the case, Democrats won’t be able to pass anything if they lose one Democratic senator.

He then stated, “I commit to you tonight, and I commit to all of your viewers and everyone else that’s watching, I want to allay those fears, I want to rest those fears for you right now. Because when they talk about, whether it be packing the courts or ending the filibuster, I will not vote to do that. I will not vote to pack the courts. I think — and I will not vote to end the filibuster. … I will not be the 50th Democrat voting to end that filibuster or to basically stack the court, and in all the other things you’re hearing about, Bret, also, defund the police. I don’t know of any of the Democrats in the caucus that are for defunding the police. We’re not for that whatsoever. And when they talk about basically, Medicare for all, we can’t even pay for Medicare for some. It doesn’t make any sense at all.”

Manchin later added that Democrats have been “tagged” that all Democrats must support “crazy stuff” like the Green New Deal, and he doesn’t.

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow, Eggers said American voters are raising concerns because states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania — where President Trump’s campaign has alleged fraud in the presidential election — have histories of voter fraud.

LISTEN:

“Breitbart has been a leader in identifying possible vulnerabilities …. some of those vulnerabilities have not done any favors in terms of making people feel more confident about the integrity of the election that just occurred, right?” Eggers said:

“When you have states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, that you see these weird anomalies in terms of the pattern of votes coming in,” Eggers continued. “Same thing happened in Wisconsin, and the states like that, where you have documented history, problems dealing with the influx of mail-in balloting and documented history of voter fraud occurring in those systems. Those are the reasons why people are asking tough questions.”

Eggers noted that while the establishment media is rushing to declare Democrat Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) the winners of the election, contested elections in recent history have shown that such legal disputes can last for weeks and months.

“Al Gore gave his concession speech on December 13. Right, think about that. December 13, that’s like six weeks after the election,” Eggers said of the 2000 presidential election. “That wasn’t everyone just standing around. It was ‘We got lots of court battles. We’ve got lots of different things happening.'”

“I think we deserve to have hard questions asked about problems that people identified ahead of time about the election,” Egger said. “But it’s interesting that it doesn’t seem like the media’s gonna give us space to have those conversations.”

Eggers said GAI is in the process of analyzing where Americans should be looking in terms of trying to identify fraud and vulnerabilities in the election system. Some issues have already been alleged by the Trump campaign, which claims that at least 3,000 votes in Nevada have been improperly counted.

“It’s not a conspiracy to say that’s an example of an irregularity — I’m not sure what the actual margin is in Nevada right now and whether that’s enough to supersede that — but that’s an example of something that’s worth paying attention to,” Eggers said.

Eggers mentioned numerous documented cases where voter fraud has been alleged or pointed out in Pennsylvania and Michigan.

“The top election official in Pennsylvania four years ago resigned quietly after the election — and then subsequent emails obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed that Pedro Cortez was actually fired by the governor because he presided over a system that allowed for what he called ‘a glitch’ that allowed illegal votes,” Eggers said. He went on to say:

Philadelphia had an election judge arrested this year for stuffing ballot boxes because they’re paid by political operatives. In Michigan, they proactively sent everybody absentee ballot request forms, and you’ve got document issues with more registered voters than legal voters in certain key areas. Detroit had election officials charged with voter fraud before. When you combine that and you see some of the stuff that’s coming out about possibly dead people requesting ballots, based on information that you can access off of the Secretary of State’s website. It certainly raises questions.

The bottom line, Eggers said, is that mail-in voting is “by far the most suspectable form of voting fraud.”

“I would never give my wallet to somebody else and ask them to take it to the bank for me,” Eggers said. “So the idea of sort of an additional layer in between you and the ballot box, I mean, … the system wasn’t set up for the massive increase.”

Host Joy Reid asked, “You already have the Biden administration planning executive orders. … They want to get the United States back on the Paris Climate Accords. They’re going to reverse this withdrawal from the World Health Organization, which is great news, repeal the ban on all travel from Muslim-majority countries, reinstate the DREAMers program. So, he’s going to have to do a lot by executive order, right?”

Clyburn responded, “Absolutely. And I want him to. The fact of the matter is, extend the olive branch, let them know what your programs are, ask them to join. And if they don’t, then let’s go with the executive order. I used to say that to Barack Obama all the time. And I’m saying that here.”

“Right now — there are fewer than 100,000 votes total — out of almost 150 million cast — separating AZ, GA, WI, & PA (plus other close states like NV) with a number of lingering questions,” the congressman, who defeated Democrat challenger Wendy Davis, said.

“Recounting, auditing, & a full review is necessary. Patience. #StandUpForAmerica,” he added in the Monday morning tweet:

As of Monday afternoon, Biden continued to hold the edge in key states — roughly 17,000 in Arizona, 10,600 in Georgia, 36,100 in Nevada, and 45,000 in Pennsylvania. That reflects roughly 109,000 votes across all four states. However, legal challenges are underway, and the Trump campaign has maintained that the president will emerge victorious in Arizona once all legal ballots are finally tabulated.

Several GOP lawmakers have made it clear that they back Trump and his efforts to ensure election integrity.

“The media do not get to determine who the president is. The people do,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said following the media declaring Biden the winner.

“When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is,” he added:

Zachary Larsen, who served in both the Bill Schuette (R) and Dana Nessel (D) administrations, was a Republican poll challenger and arrived at the TCF Center in Detroit to observe the absentee ballot counting process last week.

Larsen said “the secrecy of the ballot was not being respected” throughout the process.

“Instead, the second official at the table where I was observing was repeatedly placing her fingers into the secrecy sleeve to separate the envelope and visually peek into the envelopes in a way that would allow her to visually observe the ballot and identify some of the votes cast by the voter,” he said in an affidavit that was part of a suit filed by the Great Lakes Justice Center.

Larsen said other individuals in the ballot counting process would also “peek to observe the ballot,” and he confirmed with other observers that they were seeing similar behaviors.

He said he was concerned that by violating the secrecy, a worker’s personal political preferences may impact whether a ballot would be placed in the “problem ballots” box.

In another allegation, Larsen said he observed workers county ballots “without confirmation that the voter was an eligible voter in the poll book.”

According to Larsen:

The first ballot scanned came in as a match to an eligible voter. But the next several ballots that were scanned did not match any eligible voter in the poll book. When the scan came up empty, the first official would type in the name “Pope” that brought up a voter by that last name. I reviewed the running list of scanned in ballots in the computer system, and it appeared that the voter had already been counted as having voted. Then the first official appeared to assign a number to a different voter as I observed a completely different name that was added to the list of voters at the bottom of a running tab of processed ballots on the right side of the screen. That same official would then make a handwritten notation on her “supplemental poll book,” which was a hard copy list that she had in front of her at the table.

“I was concerned that this practice of assigning names and numbers indicated that a ballot was being counted for a non-eligible voter who was not in either the poll book or the supplemental poll book,” Larsen said in his sworn affidavit, which comes with a legal punishment for not being truthful.

“From my observation of the computer screen, the voters were certainly not in the official poll book. Moreover, this appeared to be the case for the majority of the voters whose ballots I had personally observed being scanned.”

Larsen said he attempted to move closer to have a better look at what was taking place, and he was ordered to stand back six feet, because of coronavirus concerns, despite wearing a mask.

Larsen’s allegations are part of a lawsuit filed by Wayne County residents Cheryl A. Constatino and Edward P. McCall Jr. against the City of Detroit and Detroit Election Commission, Detroit City Clerk Janice M. Winfrey, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers.

Michigan talk radio host Steve Gruber noted the fraud was committed “at the behest of Detroit and Wayne County officials and included changing legal names and dates on ballots, ballot harvesting, voter intimidation and more. It also claims the effort to defraud voters began in early September.”

Graham made the comments during an interview with Fox News Radio’s Brian Kilmeade.

“What I’m going to tell Mitch McConnell today when we get back if we keep the Senate, we need to do a joint committee in the Senate to analyze mail-in balloting and how it worked in 2020,” Graham said.

The issue of mail-in balloting has sparked controversy since states and lawmakers first discussed using the practice on a large scale, due to concerns over the coronavirus. President Trump frequently voiced his opposition to mail-in voting in the run-up to the election, primarily, because the practice is highly vulnerable to fraud.

Currently, President Trump’s legal team is contesting the vote counts in several key swing states where mail-in votes made up a substantial portion of the total number of votes.

Graham made it clear that last week’s election needs to be investigated and that the election is “by no means over.”

“All I’m asking people to do is run down every credible allegation of misconduct, look at the computer systems, look at the provisional ballots, then we’ll make a decision, go to court, then we’ll make a decision about who won the presidency” Graham explained. “It would be insane for President Trump not to look at all this stuff.”

On Friday, McConnell posted a tweet saying that a “legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not.”

“Here’s how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws & resolve disputes. That’s how Americans’ votes decide the result,” McConnell wrote.

Former Vice President Joe Biden currently has 290 electoral votes, according to the Associated Press. However, none of the 50 states have certified their elections and President Trump’s legal team is pursuing challenges to the results in several key swing states.

While Sterling, the statewide voting system implementation manager, said he does not appreciate attempts to undermine the system that was put together by the secretary’s office and county elections directors, he explained they will find instances of voter fraud as they move forward.

“The facts are the facts, regardless of outcomes,” he said.

“And that’s one of the things we’re focusing on here is getting our count accurate and right, getting accurate information so at the end of the day, everybody — regardless of whose side won and whose side lost — understands that in Georgia, we had an actual accurate outcome,” he continued:

He told reporters, though he added that it is “unlikely” that those instances of fraud will match the margin of Joe Biden’s (D) lead in the Peach State:

Now. Let me be perfectly clear on another point. We are going to find that people did illegally vote. That’s going to happen. There are going to be double voters. There are going to be people who shouldn’t — did not have the qualifications of a registered voter to vote in this state. That will be found.

“Is it 10,353? Unlikely. But every election, as I’ve said I think every day at this podium, is imperfect. The issue now is … when the margins are this tight, every little thing matters,” he continued. “So this office will thoroughly investigate.”

Sterling expressed confidence that the system counted the votes properly, largely dismissing the narratives of widespread fraud. He stated that the audit will prove the accurate tabulation and a recount will reaffirm.

“But on the front end, we need to make sure that the absentee ballot process is tight as it can be so we can stop illegal voting and stop double voting now and in the future,” he added:

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) called on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to resign Monday over his handling of the state’s 2020 presidential election.

“The management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,” the statement via Perdue and Loeffler reads. “We have been clear from the beginning: every legal vote cast should be counted. Any illegal vote must not. And there must be transparency and uniformity in the counting process. This isn’t hard. This isn’t partisan. This is American. We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out — even when it’s in your own party.”

“There have been too many failures in Georgia elections this year and the most recent election has shined a national light on the problems. While blame certainly lies elsewhere as well, the buck ultimately stops with the Secretary of State,” the statement continues. “The mismanagement and lack of transparency from the Secretary of State is unacceptable. Honest elections are paramount to the foundation of our democracy.”

The statement concludes, “The Secretary of State has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections. He has failed the people of Georgia, and he should step down immediately.”

The development came after Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, announced that 47 counties have reported their certified results. Presently, former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in the state by 10,621 votes.

On Sunday, the Trump campaign tapped Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) to lead a recount effort for the campaign in Georgia.

“In order for Americans to have full faith and confidence in our elections, every legal vote must be counted and every illegal or fraudulent vote must be excluded,” Collins said in a statement.

“We look forward to guaranteeing that our elections are safe and secure, just as we look forward to President Trump winning Georgia,” the lawmaker added."

Authorities arrested two female Biden fans who also allegedly harassed the group as well.

The incident took place on Saturday in Harlingen when Trump supporters gathered for a prayer meeting in the city’s downtown area, information released by the local police department revealed.

The group was holding their meeting when 20-year-old John Rivas arrived with two other women and he began throwing eggs, a statement by Harlingen Police revealed. When the Trump supporters asked him to leave, Rivas “displayed a knife” and then left the area before police arrived. Authorities located Rivas shortly after and tried to arrest him, but the teen apparently resisted for a short period. Authorities say they found a serrated kitchen knife. Police charged Rivas with one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, one count of resisting arrest, and one misdemeanor count of disruption of a meeting.

Authorities also arrested Marilyn Lopez, 19, and Millanie X. Ortiz-Ruiz, 18, on misdemeanor disruption of a meeting charges.

A local resident posted on Facebook the moment when Rivas appears to struggle with police. One of the female suspects can be heard threatening to spit on the face of a man who tried to help police during the arrest.

Human Rights Council on Monday that America do more to fight “systematic racism, racial discrimination, white supremacy, religious intolerance, and xenophobia.”

Ahead of the U.N.’s periodic review of the U.S.’s human rights record on Monday, the international body published questions for the evaluation submitted by other countries in advance. China’s questions for the U.S. include, “What measures has U.S. taken to eliminate systematic racism, racial discrimination, white supremacy, religious intolerance and xenophobia?”

No joke: Ahead of U.N. review of U.S. rights record, China—which herded 1 million Muslims into camps to kill their religion & culture—asks: “What measures has U.S. taken to eliminate systematic racism, racial discrimination, white supremacy, religious intolerance and xenophobia?“ pic.twitter.com/azw4UMagK7 — Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer) November 8, 2020

Satellite evidence and testimonies from escapees suggest that China has imprisoned between 1 and 3 million Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, and other minorities in concentration camps over the past few years in its northwestern Xinjiang territory, which borders Central Asia.

Since at least 2017, the CCP has built concentration camps, which it officially refers to as “vocational training centers,” in Xinjiang for the purposes of mass cultural assimilation. The region’s native minorities differ greatly in terms of ethnicity, culture, language, and religion from China’s ruling ethnic Han majority; the CCP wishes to assimilate the minorities into Han culture to eliminate potential threats to the Communist Party’s power. Uyghurs who have survived Xinjiang’s detention camps say they were forced into slave labor, subjected to Communist Party political indoctrination, and endured physical and sexual abuse. Some say they were electrocuted, sterilized, or tested in manners consistent with organ harvesting.

A bipartisan group of U.S. legislators on October 26 introduced a draft bill in the U.S. Senate accusing China of committing “genocide” against ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang through its alleged detention camp system.

The resolution alleges that Beijing has discriminated “against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups” in a campaign that “constitutes genocide.”

The draft bill is meant to “hold China accountable under the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and set in motion the process to coordinate an international response to end abuses in the region,” according to the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia (RFA).

The resolution was introduced by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who were also joined by Sens. James Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

“There can be no question that the People’s Republic of China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang,” Menendez said in a press release accompanying the resolution.

“Stopping a genocide is consistent with our national security and our values, and it starts by standing up and speaking the truth. I hope that [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump and [U.S.] Secretary Pompeo will join us in calling this genocide by its name and responding to it with our partners in the international community,” he continued.

Cornyn said the rights abuses in Xinjiang were “part of ‘a despicable campaign of genocide’ carried out by the [Chinese] state,” according to RFA.

“This resolution recognizes these crimes for what they are and is the first step toward holding China accountable for their monstrous actions,” he explained.

Risch noted in his remarks that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has implemented measures that include forced sterilizations and abortions of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, calling them “truly abhorrent.”

“These actions targeting Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities constitute genocide, and I am proud to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle in introducing a resolution that defines them as such,” he said.

“The United States and countries around the world must continue to draw attention to what is happening in Xinjiang,” Risch added.

Rubio, co-chair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), said it is time for the U.S. to officially denounce China’s “heinous crimes” and “atrocities” in Xinjiang.

“It is for that reason that I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan resolution declaring that the egregious human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities constitute genocide,” he said.

“Free nations must urgently come together and press for an end to these crimes and seek accountability and justice,” Rubio added.

Cardin said the U.S. Congress can no longer overlook the CCP’s abuses, which he said, “demand a forceful U.S. response.”

Merkley highlighted reports of other alleged human rights abuses by the CCP in Xinjiang, “including the use of torture in interrogations and the deployment of equipment that has turned the XUAR [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] into a high-tech surveillance state, which he said constituted ‘genocide, pure and simple,’ adding that the U.S. ‘can’t stand silent’ on the issue any longer,” RFA relayed."

Maduro expressed a desire for “decent, sincere, direct channels of dialogue” between the two countries.

“I congratulate the American people on the presidential election,” Maduro wrote on Twitter. “I also congratulate president-elect Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their victory.”

“Venezuela, the homeland of the Liberator Simón Bolívar will always be open to dialogue and understanding with the people and the government of the United States,” added Maduro.

Venezuela, la Patria del Libertador Simón Bolívar siempre estará dispuesta al diálogo y al entendimiento con el pueblo y el gobierno de los EE.UU. pic.twitter.com/4o5S7MPuyG — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) November 7, 2020

The leftist dictator reiterated the sentiment in a televised speech on Sunday.

“In time … we will work, hopefully, to resume decent, sincere, direct channels of dialogue between the future government of Joe Biden,” he declared.

Maduro issued similar remarks in 2016 following Trump’s election. Reports claimed the dictator had sent a private congratulations to Donald Trump and expressed a desire for “respectful relations” between the two countries.

“I aspire, hope, and will work so that, hopefully, with the next presidency with Donald Trump, an independent, Bolivarian Venezuela, peaceful and revolutionary, will have the best respectful relations with the United States of America,” Maduro said at the time.

The alleged charm offensive did not prove successful. The Trump administration proceeded to lead efforts to remove him from power as well as the imposition of numerous economic sanctions against his regime and the country’s vital oil industry.

Biden promised to take a similarly tough line against the socialist regime during his campaign against Trump. Throughout his presidential campaign, Biden attempted to replicate the current administration’s tough line against Venezuela by admitting that Maduro was a “dictator,” and slamming Trump for expressing a willingness to meet with him under the right circumstances.

“Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro,” he wrote on Twitter back in June. “As president, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy.”

Biden personally met Maduro as vice president in 2015. Rather than pressuring him for the numerous human rights atrocities his regime was committing in repressing protests that year, Biden complimented Maduro’s strong hairline.

“If I had your hair, I’d be president of the United States,” he reportedly told Maduro during their meeting in Brazil.

Maduro claimed shortly after this meeting that Biden was personally plotting to assassinate him.

While serving under the Obama administration, Biden, a former top member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, helped forge a policy of appeasement and dialogue with rogue states such as Iran and Cuba. Experts believe his record on foreign policy, as well as the dramatic shift to the left within the Democratic Party, was one of the major reasons why he lost ground with Hispanics nationwide.

This was particularly the case in Florida, where the support of the Cuban and Venezuelan communities helped delivered a comfortable victory for Donald Trump in what is traditionally considered to be a swing state.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) accused Israel of “ethnic cleansing” after it demolished an illegal Bedouin settlement in a desert area in the West Bank last week.

Omar, who has a history of anti-Israel invective and sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the incident a “grave crime” and claimed that it violated U.S. law.

This a grave crime—in direct violation of international law. If they used any US equipment it also violates US law. An entire community is now homeless and will likely experience lifelong trauma. The United States of America should not be bankrolling ethnic cleansing. Anywhere. https://t.co/cdJgqS6Nwe — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) November 6, 2020

However, the Israeli government said that the settlement had been built illegally in an area designated by the military asa live-fire zone since 1972.

The Times of Israel noted:

Israel declared the area to be a live-fire zone in 1972, according to court filings. Humsa’s Bedouin residents appealed to the Israeli High Court to cancel their campsite’s impending demolition. In 2019, the court rejected the petition and ruled the herders had no right to stay in the area. While Israeli military law forbids the expulsion of permanent residents from a firing zone, the High Court ruled that Khirbet Humsa’s residents did not meet that standard. “The petitioners have no recognized property rights in these areas. These are intruders who use these areas for grazing,” the High Court said. In their decision, the High Court said that the evacuation would also serve the personal safety of the residents, due to the army’s presence in the area. Moreover, “the construction in the area has not been authorized and is illegal,” the court ruled.

The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) slammed Omar’s comments: “Omar’s tweet engendered numerous anti-Israel retweets on twitter, spreading her antisemitic hatred and calling for action against Israel.”

Zell added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement congratulating Biden, which came hours after other world leaders’ had issued their felicitations, was with Israel’s best interests in mind.

“This thing isn’t over. We need to be vigilant and be patient,” Zell told Breitbart News.

According to Zell, the prospects of a Trump win are “not bad,” and until the courts address what happened in Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, there is nothing more to discuss.

“There is competing evidence of widespread irregularities in all of these states,” Zell said, adding that there was a strong possibility of flipping Pennsylvania, which received hundreds of thousands of disputed ballots after Election Day.

“What Trump is doing is more than commendable, it’s laudable,” Zell said of the incumbent’s efforts to protest the projected Biden victory.

“He’s protecting the integrity of the election process,” Zell said. “I’m not giving it a spin. In my heart of heart I believe this.”

“Otherwise, there will be a cloud over these results,” he said.

He added that if the courts found that indeed, the elections were fair and free of any fraud, Trump would not have a problem leaving the Oval Office.

“There’s no chance he’ll dally around and delay departure,” Zell said, adding that the media’s efforts to make out otherwise were just part of an intimidation campaign.

Zell also asserted that reports that some people in his inner circle, including First Lady Melania Trump and senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, were pressuring him to concede were “complete nonsense.”

“Those reports are part of a sophisticated scheme to marginalize him,” Zell said.

He added that competing reports are emerging that Kushner will galvanize Trump supporters in contested states to rally, and if that were to happen, it would “make history.”

“It’s important for the whole viability of the electoral process,” he stated.

He slammed media networks for playing their own part in the outcome of the elections.

“The networks don’t call presidential elections.”

Zell blasted Fox News, which was taken to task for calling Arizona early, and the New York Post, which ran an article saying the math was “nearly impossible” for Trump to win reelection.

“[Rupert] Murdoch has decided that he’s no going to allow his papers to take a different perspective than the mainstream media,” Zell said, adding that Fox viewers are abandoning the network in droves.

“There’s been widespread dissatisfaction with the way Fox has covered the elections,” he said, adding that while opinion shows like Hannity were still good, “the newscasting has gone off the deep end.”

“It’s ok, we’ll just have to stick to Newsmax, OAN and of course Breitbart,” he added.

After a long delay, Netanyahu finally issued a statement early Sunday morning congratulating Biden. He came under fire for not issuing a statement the previous evening, as did many western leaders, but was also condemned for issuing one at all before the release of the official results.

“I can’t be critical of it. Bibi has to do what’s best for state of Israel,” Zell said, using Netanyahu’s nickname. “Israel needs to cover its bases and maintain good relations with the U.S.”"

Trump.

Of the 19 tweets posted by the President in the last 24 hours, 30 percent have been tagged with a warning from Twitter calling them “disputed,” and linking to a Twitter “fact check” — which usually consists of claims from the Democrat-aligned mainstream media.

Jack Dorsey’s far-left social network has been leading the campaign to prevent the President’s messages from reaching American voters online. As of November 5, Twitter had censored half of President Trump’s tweets since election day.

This censorship has been found to drastically reduce the rate at which the President’s messages reach the American public, with the post-censorship rate of retweets and other engagements cut by over 80 percent in some cases.

On November 7, Twitter censored another string of the President’s tweets, copied below.

“People were screaming STOP THE COUNT & WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY (As Legal Observers were refused admittance to count rooms)!” tweeted Trump earlier today, responding to a tweet from Rep. Jim Jordan celebrating a legal win for Republicans and the President in the Pennsylvania vote count.

Verdict: False.

The Covid-19 [coronavirus] vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is being produced as part of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, the revolutionary public-private partnership launched earlier this year to speed the development, production, and distribution of vaccines to protect against the virus.

The companies announced that they were developing the vaccine in collaboration with Operation Warp Speed in July.

“Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the execution of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] and the Department of Defense [DOD] to meet the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program goal to begin delivering 300 million doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 in 2021,” a press release from the companies stated in July.

The press release from the companies included a quote from HHS Secretary Alex Azar that described the agreement as adding the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to “Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio”:

The U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval. The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses. Americans will receive the vaccine for free consistent with U.S. government’s commitment for free access for COVID-19 vaccines. “We’ve been committed to making the impossible possible by working tirelessly to develop and produce in record time a safe and effective vaccine to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO. “We made the early decision to begin clinical work and large-scale manufacturing at our own risk to ensure that product would be available immediately if our clinical trials prove successful and an Emergency Use Authorization is granted. We are honored to be a part of this effort to provide Americans access to protection from this deadly virus.” “Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio by adding a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of this vaccine to the American people.”

Similarly, Pfizer’s Facebook page announced the collaboration with Operation Warp Speed.

The U.S. government consistently reported on the developments of Pfizer’s vaccine as if they were part of the Operation Warp Speed, with no objections from the company or the media.

Confusingly, some media outlets and an executive from the company itself on Monday denied Pfizer was a part of Warp Speed.

“No, Pfizer’s apparent vaccine success is not a function of Trump’s ‘Operation Warp Speed,” a Washington Post headline declared.

That contradicts a story in the Washington Post in July about the agreement with Pfizer, which included the subhead: “The contract is the largest yet under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, and will start with 100 million doses.”

“We were never part of the Warp Speed,” Pfizer Vice President Kathrin Jansen told the New York Times. “We have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.”

The first part of that statement is false and the second part of the statement is misleading. Pfizer had decided that it would pursue the vaccine on its own, taking the financial risk that the drug would not wind up being effective. And unlike other companies pursuing a vaccine, Pfizer did not receive up-front financial backing before it began developing and manufacturing its vaccine.

Pfizer did receive fast-track designation from the Food and Drug Administration and a promise by the U.S. government to buy 100 million doses for the public at a price of $1.95 billion if the drug proved safe and effective. That contract is part of the Warp Speed project."

The Business Insider reported Monday:

House Democrats are showing no sign they intend to just let President Donald Trump off the hook once he’s out of office. In fact, Trump’s re-election loss gives them even more opportunity to get to the bottom of questions they’ve been pursuing for years around the New York businessman-turned-politician’s finances and taxes. Lawmakers armed with subpoena power could also turn up information that federal prosecutors might not know about as the Justice Department under Joe Biden weighs whether to pursue a criminal case against Trump, who as a former president will no longer have immunity from such matters. … Democrats may also get a helping hand in their efforts once Biden gets sworn in and installs new leadership atop the federal government. At that point, agencies like the IRS and Treasury that have often ignored record requests from House lawmakers over the past four years could start sending them reams of long sought-after documents.

Democrats have pursued investigations of Trump, his family, and his private businesses for years in an unprecedented effort to find grounds for ousting the president or tarnishing his reputation.

Those investigations include Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into “Russia collusion,” which found none; and the impeachment inquiry, which ended earlier this year with Trump’s acquittal.

Democrats are not limiting themselves to oversight of government actions taken by the president and his administration, but will continue to pursue the president’s personal matters.

Democrat Reps. Xochitl Torres Small (NM), Abby Finkenauer (IA), Kendra Horn (OK), and Joe Cunningham (SC) have each been confirmed to have lost their races by the Associated Press, and according to vote totals, Democrat Reps. Anthony Brindisi (NY), TJ Cox (CA), and Harley Rouda (CA) currently trail their GOP challengers in yet uncalled races. Democrat Rep. Ben McAdams (UT) keeps trading places with his GOP challenger as well in a tight race, meaning that when all the dust settles, at least seven and potentially eight of the Democrats backed by Chamber of Commerce are going to have lost their reelection bids.

Despite the poor showing from the Chamber’s controversial foray into Democrat endorsements, support from the D.C.-based business lobby may have helped a few Democrats keep their seats by just a few points — thereby helping to preserve a narrow Democrat majority in the House.

With support from the Chamber, Democrat Rep. Angie Craig (MN) beat GOP challenger Tyler Kistner by just two points, 48 percent to 46 percent. Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger (VA) beat GOP nominee Nick Freitas, 51 to 49 percent. Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne (IA) beat the GOP’s David Young 49 percent to 48 percent, and Democrat Rep. Haley Stevens (MI) beat GOP nominee Eric Esshaki 50 percent to 48 percent.

The full list of Democrat endorsements from the Chamber does not include other seats Republicans retook from Democrats in some places around the country, such as Minnesota or New York. Regardless of whatever happens with challenges by President Donald Trump to the top-of-ticket results that have media organizations declaring former Vice President and Democrat nominee Joe Biden the president-elect — Trump is challenging those results in several states — the Republicans significantly outperformed expectations down-ballot, especially in House races, even in the face of opposition from the Chamber. Official prognosticators like the Cook Political Report had projected the Democrats would pick up House seats, but they were all wrong: Republicans net-gained seats, and may have, depending on a few outstanding races, significantly cut into the Democrats’ majority — even without Chamber support.

The Chamber’s support for Democrats was matched by donors’ support for the leftist candidates. Business Insider reported:

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, [Democrat Rep. Antonio] Delgado significantly outraised and outspent [Kyle] Van De Water. As of October 14, Delgado raised $5.6 million, spent $2.4 million, and had $3.3 million in cash on hand, while Van De Water raised $130,381, spent $76,488, and had $53,893 in cash on hand.

The Chamber’s shift towards Democrats comes as more business groups denounced President Trump’s curbs on migration and visa workers. Establishment media sites often portray the curbs as human rights controversies, but the federal supply of foreign labor is a huge economic factor for the companies and investors.

For example, on June 22, Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring the inflow of visa workers preferred by Fortune 500 executives. In response, the pro-migration New York Times printed a pro-migration op-ed by the Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue:

If you want businesses to grow and the economy to rebound, you allow skilled workers to come here legally to work and contribute to the well-being of our nation; you don’t lock them out. If you want the next revolutionary start-up to be founded in America, you welcome foreign students; you don’t threaten to upend their lives and send them home during the middle of a pandemic. And if you want children to grow up to reach their potential and live their American dream, you give them the tools and certainty to succeed; you don’t kick them out of the only country they’ve ever known.

The 23 Democrats supported by the Chamber scored roughly 70 percent in the Chamber’s list of “key business votes” during 2019. Several are members of the Democrat “Blue Dog” caucus that says its members are “pragmatic Democrats, appealing to the mainstream values of the American public.”

The Chamber’s decision to back 23 Democrats prompted much turmoil in the Chamber, including the departure of its veteran strategist Scott Reed, and pushback from some of the 50 independent state chambers who work with the D.C.-based U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Breitbart News reported September 29:

One insider called the Chamber “an elitist organization,” while another said their Democrat endorsements were “what happens when the Washington swamp and Wall Street get together in Nancy Pelosi’s conference room and make a deal.” The number of small businesses paying dues to the Chamber stands at less than 7,000 today, according to sources with knowledge. In its heyday, the Chamber had about 130,000 small businesses paying dues. In response, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence reportedly criticized the Chamber in a phone call. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has publicly said he does not want the Chamber’s endorsement, characterizing the group as sell-outs.

Overall, open-ended legal migration is praised by business and progressives partly because migrants’ arrivals help transfer wealth from wage-earners to stockholders.

Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.

Migration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, short-change labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation, undermine labor rights, and get many progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street’s priorities."

Gary Herbert Imposes Mask Mandate During Coronavirus Surge,"Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert imposed a mask mandate Monday to last “for the foreseeable future” after a surge in coronavirus cases caused him to declare a state of emergency.

Herbert, who had supported wearing masks but stopped short of imposing a mandate, backtracked after the state had a 46 percent increase in coronavirus cases over the past two weeks, NBC News reported.

“We cannot afford to debate this issue any longer,” Herbert said in a tweeted video Sunday. “Individual freedom is certainly important, and it is our rule of law that protects that freedom”:

Due to the alarming rate of COVID infections within our state, tonight I issued a new state of emergency with several critical changes to our response. These changes are not shutting down our economy, but are absolutely necessary to save lives and hospital capacity. #utpol pic.twitter.com/BuSNBsCbiz — Gov. Gary Herbert (@GovHerbert) November 9, 2020

Herbert issued the mandate the same day coronavirus cases hit 50 million around the globe and before the drug company Pfizer announced Monday that an early analysis of its coronavirus vaccine trials showed the vaccine was 90 percent effective at preventing infections.

“Today is a great day for science and humanity,” Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, according to NBC News.

“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity, and economies struggling to reopen,” Bourla added."
76,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/09/report-david-bossie-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/,Report: David Bossie Tests Positive for Coronavirus,"David Bossie, the veteran conservative operative who reportedly will lead the Trump campaign’s legal challenges contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election in key battleground states, has tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, according to Bloomberg News.

BREAKING: Trump outside adviser David Bossie tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, sources tell me. — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 9, 2020

Bossie has served as chairman of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United since 2000. He was the deputy campaign manager for President Trump in 2016.

The report comes hours after Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was revealed to have also contracted the virus. “He is resting at his house and is already beginning to feel better,” Carson’s chief of staff Andrew Hughes said of his boss. On Wednesday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows also tested positive for the illness, having been among those who attended the president’s election night party at the White House on Tuesday."
78,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/09/wsj-democrats-lost-south-texas-latinos-due-shutdowns-oil-jobs-abortion/,"WSJ: Democrats Lost Texas Latinos Due to Shutdowns, Oil, and Abortion","The chairman of the Texas Democratic Party said the red wave that moved through South Texas’s Starr County was due to three issues critical to Latino voters in that area: pandemic shutdowns, oil industry jobs, and abortion.

According to a report at the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Sunday, the idea that Starr County would have 8,224 residents vote for President Donald Trump is mindboggling.

In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton held a 60-point margin over Trump in Starr County, but, in 2020, Joe Biden barely slid over the edge to beat Trump by five points, making the county the largest swing to Trump of any in the United States.

The WSJ also observed that, in 2016, Clinton won nearby Zapata County by 33 points, but the president won it by six points this year.

Breitbart News reported Thursday, in fact, that Trump “made significant strides in traditionally Democrat-held counties on or near the Texas border,” and that “Biden lost more counties than almost any Democrat candidate in Texas’s history.”

“There is a systematic bias in the Democrat world that pigeonholes people into voting certain ways,” Dave Carney, chief political consultant for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), told Breitbart News Wednesday. “There is a belief that if more Latinos voted, more Democrats would get elected.”

WSJ reported the results in South Texas are shocking to Democrats since the Latino population in that region has been loyal to the Democrat Party, unlike Republican-leaning Latinos in Florida:

Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party and resident of the Rio Grande Valley, said the group was trying to figure out exactly what happened. What seems likely, he said, was that Democrats didn’t counter Republican messaging on three issues important to Latino voters: pandemic shutdowns, oil jobs, and abortion.

Small business owner Elizabeth Lazo told WSJ she and her family all voted for Trump.

“For our community, all the good work is in the oil lines,” Lazo said in Spanish. “There are no factories here. No work. The biggest thing is Walmart.”

Additionally, jobs in law enforcement are among the highest-paying locally, so calls from Black Lives Matter to defund the police fell flat.

Elia Saenz, a campaign worker who drives voters to the polls on behalf of local candidates, also told WSJ that, while she has not paid much attention to national politics, she decided to vote for Trump because her husband explained the president was pro-life, and Biden was not:

During three weeks of early voting in Texas, Mrs. Saenz drove some 350 people to the polls on behalf of school board candidates. While she had them in her car, she also talked about supporting Mr. Trump. Mr. Saenz knows at least two other Trump-supporting local politiqueras as well, he said, both wives of oil workers.

Democrat Party officials in South Texas said the unexpected Latino shift to Trump this year is an eye-opener, and means they have to invest more time and money in the region."

Donald Trump’s re-election has not been defeated. Right now, Joe Biden is merely “ahead in the count” of enough states to win the presidency.

But this is a contested election and we have a long way to go, probably more than a month and a plethora of legal filings, before a winner is declared.

Per our own Constitution, there is only one institution legally entitled to declare a winner in a presidential election, and that’s the Electoral College, which does not meet until the middle of December.

Only the Electoral College can dub someone “president-elect.”

The fake news media, of course — the corporate media, the same corrupt media that told us to be patient if Election Day lasted weeks, now want us to forget all that, want to close the book on the election before it has been audited, want us to believe unelected liars who sit in anchor chairs have the legal authority to declare Joe Biden “president elect.”

Well, they don’t, and the state legislatures, the district and Supreme courts would be doing the country a great disservice if they allowed themselves to be gaslighted into believing this election is over.

They must ignore the corrupt media and do their duty.

Of course, Democrats, most especially Joe Biden, are also trying to gaslight us into believing the election is over (along with Vichy Republicans), which is why Biden gave a premature victory speech on Saturday, and why he is already behaving like a president-elect.

What Biden is doing is un-American, anti-democratic, fascist, and fooling no one.

It’s also not going to work because Donald Trump is still the president, Donald Trump does not give up, and Donald Trump cannot be intimidated or gaslighted by anything or anyone.

Overall, though, what we are seeing the media do, aside from dismiss the possibility of widespread voter fraud before anyone has had adequate time to make their case and produce evidence, is declare Joe Biden the winner even before the legal recounts and re-canvassings have taken place.

The bottom line is that the media want this election shut down before anyone has a chance to look into what happened, before anyone has a chance to even see if Biden did indeed win fair and square.

I think it goes without saying that if the shoe were on the other foot, the media would be preaching for patience, as they originally told us Deplorables to do.

However this comes out, let’s be sure to remember that the media had no interest in looking into voting irregularities and vote fraud, had no interest in looking into potential software glitches and fraud, had no interest in valid recounts.

No, it’s worse than that…

The media are actively trying to block a fair and impartial look at what happened on election night, actively looking to suppress and dismiss evidence, even before it’s presented; aggressively trying to shut down investigations, aggressively trying to stop even run-of-the-mill recounts and recanvasses.

The media are un-American, evil, and terrified of what might be uncovered.

Donald Trump is fearless and relentless.

I am in no way saying there is widespread voter fraud. I am in no way saying there’s enough fraud to overturn the margins in enough states.

We don’t know.

But we damn sure had better find out.

What I am saying is that the 2020 election is far from over, far from settled, and no one should allow the media or Biden to gaslight you into believing different.

What I’m also saying is that we are not letting this go — not by a longshot.

Trump announced the firing via Twitter. He also announced he was putting Christopher C. Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center and a former Green Beret, as acting secretary of defense “effective immediately.”

…Chris will do a GREAT job! Mark Esper has been terminated. I would like to thank him for his service. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2020

The relationship between Trump and Esper soured quickly after Esper preempted the president by declaring he did not support using active-duty forces to restore peace during a summer of violent riots.

Trump had not called for using troops, but had warned he might if the violence continued. However, Esper’s preemptive declaration made it more difficult for the president to use the threat of deployment of troops as a deterrent to rioters.

Esper’s statement had come after he received criticism from the left for walking with the president to St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Park across from the White House.

The left claimed that Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley had drawn the military into politics by appearing with the president, despite Esper being a political appointee who serves at the behest of the president to carry out the president’s policies.

Esper — claiming to want to keep the military out of politics — had seldom, if ever, outwardly voiced support for the president during his tenure.

Esper, a former defense lobbyist, became the Army secretary when President Donald Trump first took office. He was a former classmate of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at West Point.

However, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s resignation in 2018 over policy differences with Trump set off a search for a new defense secretary that eventually ended with Esper’s appointment to the position.

During Trump’s tenure, the Pentagon had become a home for many Never Trumpers who took positions there and resisted the president’s positions, such as the drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and the Middle East, wanting allies to pay more for the presence of U.S. troops in their countries, and wanting to draw down forces from the African continent, among many other policies.

Esper has a long established career in Washington, DC, having served as a congressional staffer and a lobbyist for Raytheon before coming to the Pentagon.

Biden, whom multiple media outlets have declared president-elect though President Trump is challenging the results, announced members of his coronavirus advisory task force during the presser. At its conclusion, the former vice president took a moment to address what he saw as the “politicization of basic responsible public health steps, like mask-wearing and social distancing.”

“The election is over. … I won’t be president until January 20, but my message today is to everyone,” Biden told those in attendance. “It doesn’t matter who you voted … we can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months.”

“Not Democrat or Republican lives, but American lives,” Biden added.

He proceeded to argue that “the goal of mask-wearing is not to make your life less comfortable or take something away from you,” but rather a way to get “back to normal as fast as possible.”

“Please, I implore you: wear a mask. Do it for yourself. Do it for your neighbor,” Biden said. “A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together.”

The comments come one day after NBC News reported the former vice president was planning, upon taking office next year, to call on state and local officials to issue mask mandates nationwide. An aide for the Biden campaign told the outlet that if some elected officials, such as governors, refuse the call, the pressure will fall on local leaders.

“If a governor declines, he’ll go to the mayors in the state and ask them to lead,” the aide told NBC. “In many states, there is the capacity of mayors to institute mandates.”

For much of the 2020 cycle, Biden was forced to walk a tight rope on the issue of national mask mandates. Initially, during the summer, he repeatedly called for the federal government to institute a nationwide order requiring every citizen to don a mask in public.

As public attitudes towards the virus became normalized and questions arose over the constitutionality of such a mandate, Biden began backing away from the issue slightly. This was evidenced in September when the former vice president told a local CBS affiliate in Arizona that federal mask requirements likely went beyond the constraints of presidential authority."
86,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/11/09/nolte-cnns-jake-tapper-tells-trump-staffers-concede-or-get-blacklisted/,Nolte: CNN’s Jake Tapper Tells Trump Staffers Concede or Get Blacklisted,"CNN’s Jake Tapper joined the growing list of media elites and Democrats (but I repeat myself) calling for Trump staffers to be blacklisted.

Tapper is using a blacklist threat to try and convince Trump staffers to stop contesting the disputed 2020 election. He’s not even hiding it.

“I truly sympathize with those dealing with losing — it’s not easy,” the far-left CNNLOL anchor tweeted Monday, adding, “but at a certain point one has to think not only about what’s best for the nation (peaceful transfer of power) but how any future employers might see your character defined during adversity.”

Joseph McCarthy couldn’t have said it better.

Although the Trump campaign is coming forward with eyewitness accounts in the form of sworn statements alleging widespread vote fraud, although the Trump campaign is legally entitled to recounts in a number of swing states, the venal Tapper is still threatening them — telling them if they don’t give up their legal rights to legally contest a whisker-close election, they deserve to be blacklisted.

In other words, Gee, that’s a nice career you got there. Be a shame if anything happened to it.

This, obviously, is not the first time the disgraced anchor has engaged in McCarthyism and blacklisting.

Without proof, Tapper spent three years falsely accusing President Trump and his campaign staff of colluding with the Russians. Tapper did this despite the fact he knew the documents alleging collusion were bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Worse still, Tapper almost certainly colluded with disgraced bureaucrats, such as former FBI Director James Comey, to make Clinton’s phony Russia dossier public…

All of Tapper’s red-baiting is right out the McCarthyism Handbook.

And now he’s openly threatening Trump staffers that if they do not roll over and concede to his candidate, they will have a hard time making a living in the future.

Tapper appears to be in some sort of narcissistic downward spiral of hate and self-delusion. He’s openly fantasized about the president of the United States being “physically escorted from the building.” He publicly mocked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for defending her colleague Stephen Miller with a (misspelled) tweet heckling her with “Bye, Felisha.” (It’s Felicia.)

Back in September, undisputed texts revealed Tapper tried to meddle in a Pennsylvania congressional election by convincing GOP challenger Sean Parnell not to challenge incumbent Democrat Congressman Conor Lamb. We later received credible reports that Tapper basically harassed the Parnell campaign after those texts were released.

Tapper then straight up lied about his meddling, and again got caught. But Tapper and lying go together like water and wet.

Tapper, obviously, is not the first leftist or member of the corporate media seeking to create a blacklist against Trump staffers and supporters. The media are already calling for Trump staffers to be jailed and left-wing outlets like the Washington Post are defending Soviet-style “truth and reconciliation” hearings against Trump staffers and high-profile supporters.

A countless number of Tapper’s confederates on the far-left are calling for literal lists so “polite society” knows who must be banned and shunned.

The big issue, at least for me, is why are the media so eager, why is a guy like Tapper so eager to shut down a contested election?

What is he afraid of?

The media do not even want legal, automatic recounts to go forward.

Tapper is so freaked out (and full of himself) he’s openly embracing McCarthyism like a life preserver.

For the sake of the 70-plus million Americans who voted for him, and the American whistleblowers putting themselves on the line to expose what they say (in sworn statements under penalty of prison) is widespread vote fraud, Trump needs to keep digging and litigating until he is completely out of options.

In the end Trump might not prevail. In the end, there might not even be any widespread vote fraud uncovered…

We don’t know.

But we deserve to know — for the sake of democracy and for the sake of our republic.

And we cannot allow modern-day McCarthyites like Tapper to intimidate us from doing the moral and patriotic thing.

Stelter, while admitting that President Donald Trump has been more accessible than his rival, claimed that Biden had been “more truthful.”

He wrote:

Coming soon: A restoration of normal relations between the president and the press corps? Well, President-elect Joe Biden is not going to call the media the “enemy of the people,” that’s for sure. … During the general election campaign, Trump was widely accessible but wildly dishonest, spreading lies through the media’s megaphones. Biden was less accessible but more truthful, though gaffe-prone and vulnerable to out-of-context attacks.

He concluded: “The media’s adversarial approach that you’ve seen during the Trump years — demanding truth from power, calling out lies, criticizing indecency — that approach serves us well no matter who holds high office.”

Stelter’s article also included a video of his interview with Biden press secretary T.J. Ducklo, crediting the Biden for recognizing the proper role of the press.

Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stelter also blasted what he called the “shocking deference” some media outlets had shown to President Donald Trump’s lawsuits challenging the results of the recent election in several states.

NewsBusters recently rated broadcast network coverage of Trump during the presidential campaign as 92% negative, versus 66% positive for Biden.

On Monday, WTTW reporter Heather Cherone tweeted a snippet of an interview revealing that AOC is concerned over the picks that Joe Biden seemed poised to make to fill his possible administration. One of those was Emanuel, who AOC reportedly said “should not play a role in the party’s future.”

AOC also responded to Cherone’s tweet by further narrowing down why Emanuel was unacceptable to her. AOC tweeted, “We must govern with integrity and accountability. Laquan McDonald’s life mattered.”

We must govern with integrity and accountability. Laquan McDonald’s life mattered. https://t.co/wDlIVe5zPl — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 9, 2020

Of course, that was a reference to the police-involved shooting of Chicago teenager Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times after confronting police in October of 2014.

Many criticized Mayor Emanuel for keeping a lid on the shooting while he ran for re-election. Indeed, Emanuel resisted speaking much about the McDonald shooting until after his 2015 re-election to his second term in City Hall.

In November of 2015, months after Emanuel’s re-election, a court order released the McDonald shooting police dashcam video. The city soon erupted in protests over the shooting, prompting Mayor Emanuel to create the “Chicago Police Accountability Task Force” in December. Emanuel then immediately fired Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Still, despite calls for his resignation, Emanuel served his full term before announcing that he would not run for a third term in 2019.

Doug Ducey (R) has stated that while the state is “still counting the votes,” President Donald Trump “has the right to all available legal challenges and remedies” regarding election interference or voter fraud.

“In Arizona, we are still counting the votes, with roughly 75,000 to 80,000 left,” Ducey wrote in a series of tweets. “Our expectation is that we finish counting.”

We’ve been through this drill before in Arizona. Making it easy to vote and hard to cheat has also resulted in time consuming efforts to ensure the integrity of our elections. We’ve already seen the outcome of races change to a dramatic degree, and some results remain unclear. 2/ — Doug Ducey (@dougducey) November 9, 2020

“We’ve been through this drill before in Arizona,” Ducey noted. “Making it easy to vote and hard to cheat has also resulted in time consuming efforts to ensure the integrity of our elections. We’ve already seen the outcome of races change to a dramatic degree, and some results remain unclear.”

The President, just like any other candidate, has the right to all available legal challenges and remedies, and we are confident they will be properly adjudicated. We will respect the election results. 3/3 — Doug Ducey (@dougducey) November 9, 2020

Ducey concluded the social media statement by reiterating that Trump “has the right to all available legal challenges and remedies.”

“The President, just like any other candidate, has the right to all available legal challenges and remedies, and we are confident they will be properly adjudicated,” Ducey stated. “We will respect the election results.”

Last week, as doubt was placed heavily on the integrity of the presidential election, Ducey defended Arizona’s election process, saying in a tweet that the only votes counted are those that are “received up until Election Day.”

“In Arizona, we count votes received up until Election Day. That’s it,” Ducey wrote. “No judges have intervened, and no last-minute changes have been enacted. We’re following established Arizona election law to the letter.”

Over the weekend, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) called on Ducey to “investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Dominion ballot software” after reports of glitches in other states that are using the same software, such as Michigan.

“I am calling on @dougducey to call a special session of the AZ Legislature under Article IV of our state constitution to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Dominion ballot software and its impact on our general election,” Gosar wrote in a tweet.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) after the establishment media called the presidential election for them.

In a statement on Sunday, Cohn said he wished Biden and Harris “great success in leading our country” even as Trump’s campaign and election integrity groups have brought lawsuits in various swing states over allegations of voter fraud.

“Congrats to President-elect [Joe Biden] and Vice President-elect [Kamala Harris],” Cohn wrote. “I wish them great success in leading our country. With over 145M votes cast, both campaigns should be applauded for getting an unprecedented number of citizens engaged in the democratic process.”

With over 145M votes cast, both campaigns should be applauded for getting an unprecedented number of citizens engaged in the democratic process. — Gary Cohn (@Gary_D_Cohn) November 8, 2020

While in the Trump administration, Cohn fought tirelessly to derail Trump’s “America First” agenda as head of the National Economic Council. On issues involving tariffs, the coal industry, China, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Cohn sought to convince Trump to implement a globalist economic plan that deviated from his 2016 promises.

Cohn’s congratulations to Biden and Harris come after the former vice president became the favorite among Wall Street, multinational corporations, and big business throughout the 2020 campaign.

In total, Wall Street executives and employees from the nation’s biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs, spent more than $74 million trying to get Biden elected in order to oust Trump.

Conor Lamb (D-PA) said in an interview Sunday that calling for defunding the police and a ban on fracking led to Democrats losing seats.

Lamb, who just narrowly beat Republican Sean Parnell in Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District, told the New York Times that Democrats pushing for defunding the police and fracking led to Democrats losing seats in the House.

Lamb said:

I’m giving you an honest account of what I’m hearing from my own constituents, which is that they are extremely frustrated by the message of defunding the police and banning fracking. And I, as a Democrat, am just as frustrated. Because those things aren’t just unpopular, they’re completely unrealistic, and they aren’t going to happen. And they amount to false promises by the people that call for them.

Lamb added that the “rhetoric and the policies” have “gone way too far.”

“It needs to be dialed back. It needs to be rooted in common sense, in reality, and yes, politics. Because we need districts like mine to stay in the majority and get something done for the people that we care about the most,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said.

Lamb also criticized the “Squad” or progressive Democrats, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), for pushing unrealistic policies.

“But the fact is that they and others are advocating policies that are unworkable and extremely unpopular,” Lamb said.

Lamb’s interview with the New York Times follows as Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), who also represents a swing district, charged last week that Democrats should never say “defund the police” or use the word “socialism.”

“We need not ever to use the words socialist or socialism ever again. It does matter, and we have lost good members because of that,” she said during a press conference call with House Democrats.

She warned that if they repeat these leftist tactics, “We will get f— torn apart.”

John McCain (R-AZ), Cindy McCain said Monday on ABC’s “The View” that the Republican Party needed to put country above party and support the “new administration.”

Co-host Joy Behar asked, “So far, we have not heard any hint of concession from Trump. What do you hope happens in the next few days? Do you think he’ll concede?”

McCain said, “You know, that’s probably the $64,000 question. I would hope that our president will do exactly what is right for this country and concede in a gracious, polite manner. That’s what’s good for the country. Also asking Republicans to do the same, to help support this president in a new administration, and do what’s right for the country, not what’s right for our party, and I’m hoping — I’m hopeful and I pray quite a bit about this. We’ll see what happens.”

She continued, “Most of all right now, it’s —what I want is for this country to be no longer divided and work together. That’s the reason I endorsed Joe.”

She added, “What matters is that we do the right thing for our country. I do sit on the transition team, and I’m very proud and honored to do so, and my job is to help include Republicans into places within the administration. This is an administration that’s going to be all-inclusive, and there is a role for Republicans in the administration. Our party, on the other hand, I think that what we will see now is probably a bit of a change. Our party was always the party that was the party of inclusion. Years ago, during Ronald Reagan’s administration and so on, we were the inclusive ones. We were the party of Abraham Lincoln, and we’ve gone so far awry on what our values are as Republicans that it’s time to step back, slow down and stop this, and go back to our core values with regards to our Republican Party. I’m hoping that happens.”

“Nobody in Mumbai has so far turned up to claim that he is Mr. Biden’s relative,” the NDTV broadcast station noted on Sunday.

Biden has developed a record of questionable comments about Indian people. In 2006, Biden, then presumed a presidential candidate, joked that Indian people had overrun the 7-11 and Dunkin’ Donuts stores in Delaware, claiming, “You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking.” In 2012, Biden appeared to attempt an Indian accent when describing the employees at a call center during a speech in New Hampshire.

Biden chose an Indian-American, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), as his running mate in the 2020 election. Modi also congratulated Harris and noted her ancestry in Chennai, where reports indicated that local villagers gathered in temples to pray for her on Election Day.

Biden first alleged to have family ties to Mumbai during a speech there in 2013, according to NDTV.

“It’s an honor to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai. Off script for a second here, I was reminded I was elected to the United States Senate when I was a 29-year-old kid back in 1972, and one of the first letters I received and I regret I never followed up on it,” Biden said at the time. “Maybe, some genealogist in the audience can follow up for me, but I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden — Biden, my name — from Mumbai, asserting that we were related.”

In 2015, according to the Times of India, Biden identified a relative as “great, great, great, great, great grandfather George Biden,” an alleged captain in the East India Company. That supposed Biden, the vice president at the time said, had married an Indian woman and made a life there.

“There are five Bidens in Mumbai, India,” Biden told the Confederation of Indian Industry and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at an event that year.

Biden did not appear to be claiming that he was personally a descendant of Indians, which would make him America’s first Asian-American president. His remarks were also not clear enough, however, to dismiss the possibility that he meant to say he was a direct descendant of George Biden and his alleged Indian wife.

The Times of India noted that no record exists of any George Biden working for the East India Company.

“Though there are no records of a George Biden, two siblings named Christopher Biden and William Henry Biden did serve as captains in the East India Company, according to Gateway House, a foreign policy think-tank based in Mumbai,” the newspaper reported. “Christopher was 12 and his brother even younger when they started as third and fourth mates on the route between London and India via the Cape of Good Hope. In 1821, Christopher captained the Princess Charlotte of Wales and made four return journeys between England and Calcutta.”

Christopher Biden reportedly settled in Chennai, where Harris’s family is from.

Historians told the Times of India that they have no reason to believe Christopher Biden is related to Joe Biden, however.

“He’s talking about a George Biden, and there is no record of Christopher Biden having married an Indian. They don’t tally. There must be a separate George Biden, somewhere else,” V Sriram, an Indian historian, told the newspaper.

Notably, unlike Harris — whose ancestral village erupted in celebration when American media outlets claimed her presidential ticket had emerged victorious — no reports have surfaced of celebratory Indian Bidens, or even of Biden relatives anywhere in the country commenting on their distant relative’s political run.

A confirmation of Biden’s alleged Indian heritage would add surprising context to Biden’s comments on Indian-Americans over the years.

“I’ve had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking,” Biden said during an appearance on C-SPAN in 2006, when he was the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Many reacted with concern to the remark, which appeared to be propagating an offensive ethnic stereotype that Indian people all run convenience stores. Biden later attempted to clarify that his remarks were meant favorably to Indian-Americans in remarks to MSNBC.

“What I said by the way was that 30 per cent of engineers in the Silicon valley are Indians and that a significant population of Indian-Americans in Delaware up to this point have been engineers and scientists. It was a very very wealthy Indian community,” Biden said.

Biden also disappointed Indian-Americans in a 2012 speech in which he appeared to have thoughtlessly attempted an Indian accent and immediately reversed himself.

“The accent was so badly done that some commentators immediately speculated that it was supposed to be Russian — but still it brought to mind Mr. Biden’s 2006 Indian-American gaffe,” the New York Times reported at the time, citing the clip as evidence that “putting on an ‘Indian accent,’ or making fun of one, is not seen in the United States or other English-speaking nations as offensive as it would be to mock many other accents.”

Modi, who boasts a friendly relationship with President Donald Trump, congratulated Biden on his media appointment as prospective president-elect on Saturday.

“Congratulations [Joe Biden] on your spectacular victory! As the VP, your contribution to strengthening Indo-US relations was critical and invaluable,” Modi wrote. “I look forward to working closely together once again to take India-US relations to greater heights.”

Modi also congratulated Harris.

“Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership,” Modi wrote.

“I wanted to shoot this yesterday, when the news broke, but I got a little emotional, admittedly so, I got a little emotional yesterday, manly tears of course, I may have cried a tear or two, or ten, but they were all very manly. All my tears are manly,” said Johnson in a video posted Sunday to his more than 200 million instagram followers, congratulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

“But the reason why I got emotional yesterday, was because of what I felt my vote represented, and I was talking to Lauren, my wife, and we were talking about our two little baby girls, and that’s exactly what my vote represented,” the Jumanji and Fast and Furious star said. “My vote represented my little daughters.”

Watch Below:

Biden, however, has been called out for numerous occasions in which the former vice president appeared to be “handsi-ness” with women and children, as well as for instances in which he appeared to be sniffing children’s hair.

“My vote represented humanity. My vote represented decency,” Johnson continued.

Last year, then fellow Democrat presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) accused Harris of being a cruel prosecutor, putting “over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations,” and then laughing about having smoked marijuana herself. It turns out that Harris had even opposed the testing of DNA evidence for a death row inmate when she was the state’s attorney general.

While Harris did not provide any specifics as to why she did not approve the testing during her tenure, she later told a New York Times columnist, “I feel awful about this.”

“It represented the values and the principles of which we teach our little girls,” added Johnson of why he voted for the Biden-Harris ticket.

In September, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) argued that Harris was not an outsider who got into politics on her own, but that she has been successful in her career, in part, by dating former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

“Kamala Harris moved up in California politics because she was dating Willie Brown,” said Gaetz. “She is a straight-up machine candidate. That is essentially how she moved up — became the state attorney general then ran for the United States Senate. So, I’m not entirely sure Kamala Harris is here to lecture any of us on what life is like outside the system.”

The former San Francisco mayor and California State Assembly speaker Willie Brown confirmed last year that he had in fact dated Harris and appointed her to two state jobs. “Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” wrote Brown in a short article in the San Francisco Chronicle.

In September, Johnson endorsed Biden and Harris, saying “you’re a certified badass.”

In his post-election monologue, Johnson said of the 71 million Americans that voted to re-elect Trump “I acknowledge your disappointment; I acknowledge your pain.”

“It doesn’t feel good and I want you to know that I’m still here. And I’m not turning my back on you just because we have a difference of opinion, just because you voted for somebody else. No, I’m still right here. And I’m still right here for you. We’ve still got this relationship and I’m going to make sure that I continue to do everything that I can possibly do to make sure that we’re all working together as a unified front. Unity.”

Johnson also said he understand Biden and Harris supporters who are feeling “pissed and resentful” at the “years of hate, and bigotry, and racism, and anger, and fear tactics, and intimidation.”

“One down. One to go,” Baron Cohen wrote on Twitter accompanied by a photo of Zuckerberg meeting with Trump at the White House.

One down. One to go. pic.twitter.com/eQYi1pBqku — Sacha Baron Cohen (@SachaBaronCohen) November 7, 2020

The 49-year-old actor has long campaigned against Zuckerberg’s power as the owner of Facebook over his supposed failure to crack down on “misinformation” and the presence of right-wing groups on the platform.

Despite the fact that Facebook routinely censors and bans conservatives, Baron-Cohen has described Zuckerberg as a “naive, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda.”

According to Baron Cohen, Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies such as Twitter and Google don’t represent a threat to democracy because of their widespread censorship, but because they don’t censor enough. In a speech before the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in November last year, the called them “the greatest propaganda machine in history” for hate groups.

He said at the time:

Think about it. Facebook, YouTube and Google, Twitter and others — they reach billions of people. The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engaged — stories that appeal to our baser instincts and that trigger outrage and fear. It’s why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times. It’s why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth. And it’s no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history — the lie that Jews are somehow dangerous.

In January this year, Baron Cohen also accused Zuckerberg of helping to “destroy democracy” by continuing to sell political ad space on the platform, presumably over fears that Republicans would successfully weaponize social media in the 2020 election cycle.

“Terrifying. 218,000 political ads on Facebook—many with lies and hate – seen by voters perhaps 1.3 BILLION times. And Facebook profits,” he wrote at the time. “[Mark Zuckerberg], history will judge you harshly – if we still have historians after you help destroy democracy!”

Goldberg said, “I want to bring something up right now. I want to say to all those people who don’t believe that Americans actually got out and voted, let me say this to you. When you-know-who was elected four years ago, you know, Hillary Clinton didn’t say, hey, wait a minute. This doesn’t feel right. Stop the count. She didn’t say. This isn’t right. I’m not going for — she didn’t say any of that. So all of you, suck it up. Suck it up like we sucked it up. And if you are not sure that you are comfortable with Joe Biden, do what we did. Find things and then take it to the law, and if the law says it’s something to look at, look at it, but from now on, suck it up.”

She continued, “Grow the pair for him that he can’t grow for himself because this is ridiculous. You’re not sure that he won. You’re bringing into question all these Americans who voted, legally came out, and stood and voted. How dare you question it.”

“God forbid this continued and we had a full-blown second wave. It means a lot more restrictions,” de Blasio said, as the positivity rate continued to exceed two percent in New York City. “It could mean, unfortunately, having to shut down parts of our economy again, which would be horrible for this city, horrible for the livelihoods of people. It could mean having to shut down our schools…”

“If these numbers we’re reporting today continue to grow, then people are going to have to get used to more and more restrictions and going back to some of the ways we had to live in the Spring,” de Blasio added, telling people that there is “real danger.”

On Monday, the city reported 779 new cases and 71 newly hospitalized cases. During the news conference, de Blasio also stated that residents in the city should avoid large indoor gatherings and wear masks in public.

De Blasio’s announcement comes two days after he was photographed celebrating the mainstream media’s prediction that former Vice President Joe Biden would become the 46th President of the United States.

While de Blasio maintained the use of a mask, he did not maintain a six-foot spatial difference with the hundreds of others who were in the area to celebrate. As seen here, de Blasio and his wife took the time to stop and pose for photographs as he wrapped his arms around supporters.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was also photographed celebrating in the streets with other Biden supporters. At one point, Schumer removed his mask to deliver a speech while not maintaining a six-foot distance from other people."

The state has maintained public archives of COVID-19 data, which posts an updated total death count drawn from the Department’s Vital Records Program as of 11:59 PM on the previous date and broken down by county.

According to the department’s archives, Pennsylvania reported 624 deaths total in October, comparing totaled figures from October 1 and November 2 (the 1st fell on a weekend) — an average of 21.19 per day. According to the Department of Health, no date of death is given on these reports, so it is unclear how many occurred in earlier months and how many occurred in October. The CDC cautions that its own count of death certificates can come between one to eight weeks after a death occurs.

October’s total was a 40.08% spike from the 469 reported in September, according to these same archives. September’s figure was a 2.89% drop from the 483 deaths reported in August. August’s total was a 6.75% decrease from the 518 deaths reported in July. July’s total was a more than 50% drop from June’s tally of 1,114.

Twelve counties did not record any new deaths in August. Eleven of those counties had previously recorded deaths: Crawford, Elk, Greene, McKean, Perry, Somerset, Susquehanna, Tioga, Venango, Warren, and Wyoming. Cameron remains the sole county which has not yet reported any deaths.

Twenty counties reported three or fewer deaths in July: Armstrong (3), Bedford (2), Butler (3), Cambria (2), Carbon (3), Clarion (1), Clearfield (1), Clinton (1), Erie (2), Forest (1), Fulton (2), Jefferson (1), Juniata (1), Lackawanna (2), Mifflin (2), Monroe (1), Pike (1), Potter (1), Sullivan (1), and Wayne (2). Forest, Potter, and Sullivan counties each saw their first reported deaths this month.

Seventeen counties reported four to ten deaths: Adams (5), Bradford (10), Bucks (10), Centre (8), Chester (10), Columbia (8), Cumberland (4), Fayette (8), Franklin (4), Indiana (5), Lebanon (7), Lycoming (6), Mercer (7), Montour (6), Northampton (10), Union (5), and Washington (7).

Eleven counties reported 11 to 20 deaths: Beaver (18), Blair (14), Dauphin (15), Delaware (15), Huntingdon (13), Lancaster (20), Lawrence (12), Lehigh (13), Luzerne (17), Montgomery (14), and Snyder (11).

And seven counties reported more than 20 deaths: Allegheny (60), Berks (30), Northumberland (49), Philadelphia (62), Schuylkill (44), Westmoreland (49), and York (48).

Of the state’s 67 counties, Philadelphia maintains the highest total deaths (1,894), followed by Montgomery (895), Delaware (771), and Bucks (626). No other counties have yet reached 500 total deaths since the state began taking these records in March.

For comparison, the most recent public PA death statistics — from the year 2018 — marks the state’s top causes of death as heart disease (32,713 deaths for the year, an average of 2,726 per month), cancer/malignant neoplasms (27,995 deaths for the year, an average of 2,332 per month), and nontransport accidents (7,207 for the year, an average of 600 per month). [These data were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Department specifically disclaims responsibility for any analyses, interpretations, or conclusions.]

These figures reveal a key metric in the ongoing debate over how to respond to another wave of outbreaks. As cases increase, several European nations and American institutions have re-entered lockdown. The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced Monday that it is seeing promising results from a COVID-19 vaccine that is still in development. In response to this news, former Vice President Joe Biden said that, more immediately, Americans should “make progress on masking” to keep the death count from rising."

The New York Times reported:

The drug maker Pfizer announced on Monday that an early analysis of its coronavirus vaccine trial suggested the vaccine was robustly effective in preventing Covid-19, a promising development as the world has waited anxiously for any positive news about a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people. Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with the German drugmaker BioNTech, released only sparse details from its clinical trial, based on the first formal review of the data by an outside panel of experts. The company said that the analysis found that the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease among trial volunteers who had no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. If the results hold up, that level of protection would put it on par with highly effective childhood vaccines for diseases such as measles. No serious safety concerns have been observed, the company said. … Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of the two-dose vaccine later this month, after it has collected the recommended two months of safety data. By the end of the year it will have manufactured enough doses to immunize 15 to 20 million people, company executives have said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures index rose 5% on the news.

President Donald Trump pushed the development of vaccines, and created Operation Warp Speed, a plan to accelerate vaccine production and distribution.

He was exuberant at the news:

STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2020

The Pfizer news came six days after the 2020 presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), poured scorn on the president’s push for a vaccine, saying they would not trust anything he endorsed until it had been verified by independent scientists.

In the vice presidential debate in October, Harris said: “If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it.”

Several states joined in the skepticism, saying that they would develop their own separate process for reviewing the safety of any vaccine developed by the administration’s policy.

Pfizer clarified that it was not part of Operation Warp Speed and that it had not taken research money from the U.S. government.

From Monday and for at least two weeks, some 7 million people — around 70% of the country´s population — must remain at home on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.. At weekends, they cannot leave home after 1 p.m.

The government has warned that the state of emergency, which grants authorities special powers, may be prolonged and measures may be tightened if the spread of the new coronavirus does not slow.

The number of virus cases and hospital admissions in Portugal has climbed sharply in recent weeks. The country has seen 2,896 virus-related deaths."

A survey conducted by Bliss, a premature infant charity, found that 14 per cent of parents with sick babies have been prevented from staying with their ailing child as a result of social distancing measures put in place by hospitals.

Some hospitals have limited visiting time to just two hours a day, and others have limited visits to one parent per day. The study found that the draconian limits have placed an increased strain on the mental health of new parents across the country.

Carly Maclean, 30, and her partner Gary Hanson told the Daily Mail that only one parent was allowed to see their daughter, Emily, who suffered from jaundice, forcing her to be placed onto an oxygen machine at the Royal Bolton Hospital in March.

“When you’re peering at your poorly baby, the only thing that can help is the gentle comfort of your partner and the knowledge you’re not alone. Covid took that away,” Maclean said.

“And when I brought Emily home after nine days, it felt like someone else’s child because the restrictions stopped that bond. It destroys a part of you,” the mother added.

Another mother, Katie Orger, 33, said that The Rosie Hospital in Cambridge told her that she had to “book a slot” to visit her daughter, Sophia, who was born five weeks early in April.

“I never managed to breastfeed, and I can only put that down to not having the skin-to-skin and lasting contact with my daughter,” Orger said.

While parents of sick newborns in the UK have been typically afforded 24-hour access to special care baby units, NHS trusts have been introducing limits on “visitors” during the China coronavirus pandemic.

Guidance from national healthcare bodies such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have said that “visitors” should not include the parents of the child; however, this has not been followed by all hospitals.

Bliss demanded that NHS England publish national guidance for hospitals to ensure that parents are granted unfettered access to their children “as a matter of urgency”.

The chief executive of the newborn charity, Caroline Lee-Davey, said: “Our smallest and sickest babies need their parents at their side to give them the best chance of survival, even during a pandemic.”

Stillbirths Nearly Double During UK’s First Lockdown https://t.co/c625tKd6mj — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 3, 2020

The British socialised healthcare system has also seen significant failures in providing care for children, with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health admitting in October that hospitals postponed some 50,000 child surgeries between just March and May in England.

Recent figures released in the Health Services Journal also revealed that the number of stillbirths in England between April and June nearly doubled in England, with hospitals recording 40 compared to 24 during the same period last year.

The report pointed to the message of “Protect the NHS” as a contributing factor in mothers deciding not to seek care earlier.

Andrew Cuomo told Good Morning America on Monday morning that while the development of an effective coronavirus vaccine was “good news,” it was “bad news” that it would arrive while President Donald Trump is in office.

Cuomo was reacting to news that Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine had proven more than 90% effective. Stock market futures soared, and President Donald Trump welcomed the news exuberantly. Former Vice President Joe Biden, whom the media have declared the winner of the election, warned Americans that it would be “many more months” before they received it.

Cuomo went further, lamenting the timing of the announcement, because Trump would be managing the vaccine rollout:

.@AndrewCuomo says it's ""bad news"" that the COVID-19 vaccine will come while @realDonaldTrump is in office. ""We can’t let this vaccination plan go forward the way the Trump administration is designing it because Biden can’t undo it two months later."" pic.twitter.com/EqIbY8vgMS — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) November 9, 2020

George Stephanopoulos: We were talking yesterday about the importance of vaccine distribution in the next two months. What do you make of this news? Cuomo: Well, it’s good news/bad news, George. The good news is the Pfizer tests look good and we’ll have a vaccine shortly. The bad news is that it’s about two months before Joe Biden takes over, and that means this administration is going to be implementing a vaccine plan. The vaccine plan is very important and it’s probably the most ambitious undertaking since COVID began. … And the Trump administration is rolling out the vaccination plan and I believe it’s flawed. I believe it learns nothing from the past. They’re basically going to have the private providers do it, and that’s going to leave out all sorts of communities that were left out the first time when COVID ravaged them.

Cuomo provided no evidence for his assertion that communities would be “left out” by the vaccine distribution under the Trump administration.

Asked what Biden would do differently, Cuomo struggled to answer, saying that the Trump administration focused on the private sector rather than the government.

He added: “We can’t let this vaccination plan go forward the way that Trump and his administration is designing it because Biden can’t undo it two months later. We’ll be in the midst of it and I’m going — I’ve been talking to governors across the nation about that, how can we shape the Trump administration vaccine plan to fix it, or stop it before it does damage.”

Pfizer announced that its vaccine was more than 90% effective, sending stock market futures soaring. It added that the vaccine would be free:

President Donald Trump, who has championed the development of vaccines, was exultant:

STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2020

However, his rival, whom media networks have declared the next president-elect while vote counts and challenges are ongoing, greeted the news with caution.

INBOX: @JoeBiden on Pfizer vaccine progress: “I congratulate the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us such cause for hope.” But adds the battle against COVID is still ongoing, encourages mask wearing/social distancing pic.twitter.com/g1G6gvtFhq — Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) November 9, 2020

In a statement, Biden said:

Last night, my public health advisors were informed of this excellent news. I congratulate the brilliant men and women who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us such cause for hope. At the same time, it is also important to understand that the end of the battle against COVID-19 is still months away. This news follows a previously announced timeline by industry officials that forecast vaccine approval by late November. Even if that is achieved, and some Americans are vaccinated later this year, it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this country. This is why the head of the CDC warned this fall that for the foreseeable future, a mask remains a more potent weapon against the virus than the vaccine. Today’s news does not change this urgent reality. Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year. Today’s news is great news, but it doesn’t change that fact. America is still losing over 1,000 people a day from COVID-19, and that number is rising — and will continue to get worse unless we make progress on masking and other immediate actions. That is the reality for now, and for the next few months. Today’s announcement promises the chance to change that next year, but the tasks before us now remain the same.

Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), said throughout the campaign that people should be skeptical of any vaccine that President Trump supported, adding that they would take a vaccine that had been independently approved.

At least 600 demonstrators marched under the banner of ‘Rise Up Manchester’ in the city in Northern England. The protesters were seen carrying signs reading “Fear is the currency of control” and “Unite for Freedom”.

According to the Manchester Evening News, protesters were also heard chanting “lock up Chris Whitty” — the Chief Medical Officer for England and one of the heads of the government’s response team for the China coronavirus pandemic.

By 2 pm the Manchester Police issued a “dispersal order” in order to clear Picadilly Gardens.

MEN reporter Steve Robson said that by 4 pm: “Police have now driven everybody out of the central part of Piccadilly Gardens and have officers around virtually the whole perimeter. All happened remarkably quickly and without too much fuss in the end. Dozens and dozens of cops here now.”

During the event, police arrested four people on suspicion of public order offences and handed out Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) of £200 each to 24 people. The organiser of the protest is expected to receive a £10,000 fine for inciting violations of the country’s draconian COVID-19 restrictions.

Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain issued a statement to condemn the protest, pronouncing that the organisers and attendees were “irresponsible” for staging the gathering.

“Before and during this gathering, officers followed guidance to engage with the organiser and attendees, explain the restrictions and encourage compliance. Unfortunately, the encouragement was ignored which resulted in officers progressing to enforcement,” the ACC said.

“Enquiries have established that one group of attendees travelled to Greater Manchester from Cumbria via coach. The driver and the company they work for have both been reported to the relevant industry regulator,” Hussain added.

Chief Constable Ian Hopkins also condemned the protest, describing it as “utterly ridiculous behaviour from the organisers and the protesters, deliberately breaking the law and putting our communities at risk.”

On Thursday of last week, students at the University of Manchester rebelliously tore down series of “prison-like” metal fences that had been erected around dormitories to supposedly enforce social distancing measures.

“I don’t understand why they need to put up fences to keep us safe from the virus. It makes us feel like they don’t trust us, it feels like they’re locking us in our rooms,” one student said.

Hundreds of students protested that night, and eventually tore down the barriers. The university, for its part, initially said that the barriers were erected to “help avoid the mixing of households”, but later apologised and removed any of the remaining structures.

Also on Thursday, hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters attempted to stage a demonstration in London on Guy Fawkes Night. Police, however, instantly broke up the demonstration and chased the protesters through the British capital for the next two hours.

Police arrested 190 people, and one of the organisers is facing the maximum £10,000 fine. Police were also seen threatening journalists and even a Santa Clause impersonator with arrest.

The plan said a Biden administration will “ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.”

Under that section, one point read:

Establish a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country with support from trusted local organizations in communities most at risk to perform culturally competent approaches to contact tracing and protecting at-risk populations.

Biden did not elaborate on what the “culturally competent approaches” would entail, but California contact tracers began receiving training in “cultural humility” in September, according to the Institute for Global Health Sciences (IGHS).

Contact tracers ask questions related to topics that can be sensitive, including health, work, living arrangements and food resources. Public health communications require a balance between providing clear instruction, asking productive questions and listening empathetically. If those exposed to the coronavirus are to quarantine successfully, contact tracers must successfully strike this balance. The balance is made even more important, and even more challenging to find, when racial, ethnic and economic diversity are at play.

According to the IGHS, “cultural humility became an area of important focus.”

The Biden document said he will “implement mask mandates nationwide” by pressuring governors and mayors to “step up in a time of crisis.”

Biden said he wants “every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household.”

If governors refuse to issue his mask mandates, he said he would go to mayors and county executives to create such orders.

During the campaign, Biden initially floated a federal mask mandate before he admitted it was unconstitutional.

Dr. Zeke Emanuel, a Biden coronavirus adviser, told MarketWatch he believes it will take a year for things to “get back to normal” after a vaccine is released.

“I think it’ll be closer to November [2021], closer toward the end of the year,” he said.

“But it’ll probably be enough to begin opening colleges and universities [and] schools, again depending on how we distribute this thing, and how effective we can be on that.”

“He is in good spirits and feels fortunate to have access to effective therapeutics which aid and markedly speed his recovery,” Baker said.

Carson received the positive coronavirus test on Monday morning at Walter Reed Hospital after experiencing symptoms.

Carson was spotted at the election night party at the White House last Tuesday, together with other cabinet officials.

Chief Anticipates ‘Working Very Closely’ with Biden,"World Health Organization (W.H.O.) director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that he looks forward to “working very closely” with the prospective administration of Joe Biden, who said he would immediately reverse President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze U.S. support from the organization over its malfeasance during the Wuhan coronavirus crisis.

Tedros told an annual meeting of health ministers that W.H.O. needs more “flexible and predictable” financing to avoid a “major misalignment” between the organization’s resources and the expectations of the international community.

He said he welcomes reform efforts, even though W.H.O. has rejected all criticism of how it handled the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and its bungling from the outset that saw it misdiagnose the severity of the crisis.

“We still have a lot of work left to do, but we believe that we’re on the right track,” he said.

Tedros said that in the spirit of urging the international community to recapture a sense of common purpose, W.H.O. congratulated “President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and we look forward to working with this administration very closely.”

“We need to reimagine leadership, build on mutual trust and mutual accountability to end the pandemic and address the fundamental inequalities that lie at the root of so many of the world’s problems,” he added.

President Trump announced a freeze on U.S. funding for W.H.O. in April, saying it was “wrong about a lot of things” pertaining to the coronavirus.

“We want to look into the World Health Organization because they really called it wrong. They missed the call, they could have called it months earlier, they would have known, they should have known, and they probably did know,” he said.

“They seem to be very China-centric. That’s a nice way of saying it, but they seem to be very China-centric, and they seem to err always on the side of China,” he added.

Trump objected to W.H.O. and Director-General Tedros criticizing his January travel ban from China – an argument Trump would win decisively in the following months, as China later began imposing travel bans and many other countries followed suit, without much criticism from W.H.O. Today there is very little controversy when any country other than the United States announces a ban on travel from areas that are reporting coronavirus “waves.”

Trump administration officials said they presented a list of reforms that W.H.O. needed to make to sustain U.S. funding, but the reforms were not implemented.

President Trump said in May that because those “requested and greatly needed reforms” were not made, the U.S. would be “terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.”

Biden vowed during the campaign that he would reverse Trump’s decision to freeze W.H.O. funding “on day one” if he won the election.

“Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the W.H.O. and restore our leadership on the world stage,” he said in July."

In a sworn affidavit signed November 8, the whistleblower, who served as a poll worker, detailed “concerns over election polling place intimidation and voter fraud.”

One of the main concerns revolved around what the whistleblower described as the processing of illegal ballots. According to the affidavit, a team leader and two assistants told poll workers to advise those who wanted to register to vote but did not have the proper ID to make an appointment with DMV. They were then told that they could bring in proof of their appointment confirmation — which the whistleblower described as “either a paper copy or show icon [on] their phone to us” — and be registered based on that confirmation alone.

“They were then permitted to vote with a provisional ballot, even though their appointments were not until January of 2021. We were told this was being allowed all over the Valley, at all polling places,” the affidavit reads.

Poll workers were allegedly instructed to “add two zeros (’00’) to the DMV confirmation number and put it where the Driver’s License/ID number was supposed to go when we filled in the registration form on the line.”

The whistleblower also detailed the consistent presence of a Biden/Harris bus, tent, or table in the parking lot, which offered “food, drink, and political memorabilia to voters.”

“It was a very visible feature in a very narrow parking lot. On several days they had speakers, dances, music and other festivities going on,” the affidavit reads.

The whistleblower alleges that the team leader had to repeatedly address the Biden/Harris group, reminding them to maintain a 100-foot distance from the polling place.

The whistleblower also detailed an incident observed during a lunch break. In late October, the whistleblower “personally witnessed two people handing multiple unopened mail-in ballot envelopes to two other people who then opened and filled out the ballots against the side of the Biden/Harris van.”

“The same two people who marked the ballots then put the marked ballots in official pink and white envelopes. These individuals were not poll workers,” the affidavit reads. Others then formed what the whistleblower described as a “human wall” in an apparent attempt to block the view of the individuals handling the envelopes:

“When the moving human wall of people noticed me walking by, they continued moving [to] block my view as I walked,” the affidavit reads.

The whistleblower alerted the team leader, who called the Clark County Elections office. The office reportedly told her that “nothing could be done about the ballots or envelopes” that the worker witnessed individuals handling outside the Biden/Harris area. The poll worker was also told that ballot harvesting is legal.

“What I saw was not ballot harvesting,” the whistleblower said, as they were filling out ballots, not just delivering them.

“As a poll worker, I accepted mail-in ballots that voters would surrender to me so that they could vote in person, so I know mail-in ballot envelopes are pink and white and I know that these were ballots,” the whistleblower continued.

“I regularly saw people walking in with multiple ballots. We were not allowed to talk to the monitors or observers. We were not supposed to say anything ever to the observers,” the affidavit reads.

The whistleblower also listed one instance of a “furious” man, who alleged that someone “voted on his behalf.”

On Friday, the Trump campaign formally requested public records, including records, documents, and communications, from the Clark County Election Department."

“We do have some reports that have come in that we’re logging for reporting. But we’re definitely going to do an investigation, and we’ll deal with them once the canvass is finished,” Gloria (pictured) said during a Saturday press conference in response to questions involving potential voter fraud. However, the investigation will not start immediately.

“The votes are in the system at this point, so we’ll have to after the election, post-election, go after anything that’s been reported at this time,” he added.

Last week, Gloria claimed he was “not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed” in his county, which is responsible for the lion’s share of ballots in the state.

On Thursday, the Nevada GOP announced its legal team sent a criminal referral to Attorney General William Barr (R) “regarding at least 3,062 instances of voter fraud.”

“We expect that number to grow substantially. Thousands of individuals have been identified who appear to have violated the law by casting ballots after they moved from NV,” the Nevada GOP claimed:

The following day, a firm representing Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. sought public records from the Clark County Election Department as part of Trump’s greater challenge over election integrity in key battleground states.

A poll worker and employee of the Clark County Election Department, in a sworn affidavit, recently detailed alleged instances of nefarious behavior in relation to both the processing and filling out of ballots. The whistleblower claimed individuals who wanted to register to vote but did not have proper ID were instructed to make appointments with the DMV.

After showing proof of their appointment — not an ID — they were given a provisional ballot. Poll workers were then instructed to “add two zeros (’00’) to the DMV confirmation number and put it where the Driver’s License/ID number was supposed to go when we filled in the registration form on the line,” per the affidavit.

The whistleblower also “personally witnessed two people handing multiple unopened mail-in ballot envelopes to two other people who then opened and filled out the ballots against the side of the Biden/Harris van.”

“The same two people who marked the ballots then put the marked ballots in official pink and white envelopes. These individuals were not poll workers,” the affidavit reads. The whistleblower added that individuals formed a “human wall” in an apparent attempt to conceal the act."

One estimate said the spending could go beyond $200 million, Fox Business reported on Monday.

“Money is already flooding into the races: In the past two days, voting rights activist and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams raised more than $3.6 million for the contests,” the article continued:

The parties are expected to spend an exorbitant amount in the coming weeks as the state’s two Senate races — one between GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock and the other between GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff — head to a Jan. 5 runoff election.

Andra Gillespie, a political analyst for 11 Alive, believes both Democrats and Republicans will work hard to get people to vote.

“So there probably won’t be Christmas advertising here in Georgia because it is going to be taken up by political advertising. You could expect more phone calls. You should expect visits from people asking you to vote and reminding you to vote,” she said.

Last week, the Lincoln Project, a political action committee comprised of Never Trump former Republicans who raised tens of millions of dollars this year to defeat the president, threw its support behind Republican David Perdue’s Democrat challenger, Jon Ossoff, according to Breitbart News.

“We’re staying in the fight: to defeat Trumpism we must also defeat David Perdue,” the group tweeted, adding, “Let’s elect Jon Ossoff.”

However, in a statement Thursday, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Executive Director Kevin McLaughlin said Perdue would defeat Ossoff if the race went to a runoff election, Breitbart News reported.

“David Perdue won this race in regular time and will do the same in overtime. Georgians have rejected Jon Ossoff’s liberal, socialist agenda not once, not twice, but three times,” he said.

“And the fourth time will not be the charm, but instead, a perfectly miserable experience for Jon Ossoff, national Democrats and their shared dream of a socialist America,” McLaughlin concluded."

During his daily news conference, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) doubled down on his recent decision to hold off on congratulating any candidate until all legal issues were resolved. AMLO said Trump was being silenced by media when he has tried to call out irregularities.

Dice Andrés Manuel López Obrador que en Estados Unidos, el país de las libertades, censuran al presidente. pic.twitter.com/rbBPNz4hK2 — Rodrigo Pacheco (@Rodpac) November 9, 2020

“In the country of freedoms, of the free press, all of a sudden they censor the president,” Lopez Obrador said. “It is not anything–this had not been seen before. The media censors. I am talking about the U.S., because in Mexico we are used to that.”

Lopez Obrador publicly stated that it would be “imprudent” to congratulate Joe Biden before all the legal issues were resolved. Those statements drew harsh criticism from pundits in Mexico, who claimed that position could hurt Mexico’s relations with a Biden administration.

Lopez Obrador claimed that he has no disputes with any of the candidates, but he wishes to be careful to not “interfere” with a premature congratulatory statement. AMLO referenced a gaffe by Mexico’s Congress and the former head of the National Bank (BANXICO) Agustin Carstens, who congratulated Hillary Clinton on “her win” during the 2016 Election.

The standard that Democrats demanded until recently, however, was that every vote be counted first.

In 2004, then-Sen. John Edwards (D-NC), who was the running mate for Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), appeared on Election Night to promise supporters in Boston, Massachusetts, that the campaign would not concede until it had fought for every vote to be counted:

It’s been a long night. But we’ve waited four years for this victory. We can wait one more night. [Cheers] Tonight, John [Kerry] and I are so proud of all of you who are here with us, and all of you across the country who have stood with us in this campaign. John Kerry and I made a promise to the American people: that in this election, every vote would count, and every vote would be counted. [Cheers] Tonight, we are keeping our word and we will fight for every vote. You deserve no less. Thank you! [Cheers]

The context for Edwards’s pledge was the idea that Florida’s result in 2000 had been declared before every vote had been counted. (In the end, had every vote in the state been recounted, Bush likely would have won, depending on the standard.)

Nevertheless, “count every vote” became a rallying cry for Democrats — until the 2008 primary, when Democrats discounted some votes in states that had moved their primary elections earlier. In the end, party leaders cut a deal to award delegates in a way that meant Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) received delegates in Michigan, where he had not actually competed for votes.

144,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/11/09/bret-baier-deletes-tweet-exposed-exploding-backlash-fox-news/,Nolte: Bret Baier Deletes Tweet that Exposed Backlash Against Fox News,"The Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier has deleted a tweet that proved the backlash against the disgraced cable news network has exploded.

On Saturday, yours truly wrote about how the backlash against Fox News hit Defcon 1. To backfill my case, I specifically focused on the withering responses to an innocuous tweet posted by Fox’s Special Report anchor Bret Baier…

“Join me + @marthamaccallum tonight 8pmET on @FoxNews”:

(Screenshot courtesy of @TLC00001)

That’s it. That was all Baier tweeted. Nothing controversial. Nothing about the election. He didn’t try to defend his disgraced network’s indefensible decision to call Arizona early, a state that a week later is still too close to call.

All Baier did, as I pointed out Saturday, was ask people to tune in–as anodyne a tweet that was ever tweeted, and yet, the replies, tens of thousands of them, were (according to my good faith look) withering, brutal, and by a margin of around 100-to-1, if not higher.

Here are a few examples of what was going on in Baier’s replies…

Uh…no way! @newsmax @SchmittNYC ALL THE WAY! No thanks Nope. That’s a big negative nope – done with Fox! BOYCOTT FOX NEWS! WATCH OAN, NEWSMAX You have lost this loyal viewer! Trying to influence an outcome that is clearly not legitimate! How about no! Done with Fox!! I’d rather get another vasectomy without anesthesia sir Done with fox! You sold out on us! Good luck! Sorry Bret. Fox has jumped the shark. We won’t forget. Yikes the ratio on this. May want to pass that along to Murdoch’s.

And now Baier has scurried away and deleted the tweet…

The good folks at Rasmussen (the top pollster of the 2016 and 2020 elections) was one of the first to notice the deletion:

De-leeet-ed? Innocuous but infamously ratioed @BretBaier tweet inviting viewers to watch @FoxNews programming is gone. Previously said: ""Join me + @marthamaccallum tonight 8pmET on @FoxNews,""@pnjaban had a classic reply tweet below, @NolteNC wrote about it – also below. https://t.co/eIp4nairrR pic.twitter.com/riyx4j3QbR — Rasmussen Reports (@Rasmussen_Poll) November 9, 2020

To me the deletion is just more proof that Fox News is in real trouble and feels besieged. The backlash is so fierce, so grassroots, so overwhelming, Baier is forced to wishcast it all away with the cowardly deletion of a tweet — as though that somehow means it didn’t happen.

Fox’s ratings will likely remain high until the presidential election is resolved, but I am truly interested to see what happens after…

Fox News has lost its base of support, and when you lose your base of support, you are in very serious trouble. Ask the NFL, the NBA, ESPN, Megyn Kelly…

Worse still, Fox News has legitimate online competition from outlets like Breitbart News that do not lie or attempt to meddle in elections. (Fox News is guilty of both.)

Fox News also has legitimate broadcast competition from OAN and Newsmax. Yep, Fox is no longer the only place right-of-center cable news viewers can go.

And Fox blew it.

Fox News lied about Trump not repudiating racism.

Fox News released one rigged poll after another.

Fox News called Arizona early to help Biden win the post-election, public relations battle in a contested race.

Fox News rigged the first presidential debate.

Fox News deliberately interrupted Trump and allowed Biden to interrupt Trump during the first presidential debate and then lied about it.

Fox News is a pile of lying garbage, and its base of support has finally had enough.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) should they enter the White House in January.

In a conference call with the media on Monday, the Chamber of Commerce’s Neil Bradley spoke about how the business group is looking to work with a potential Biden administration.

On November 7, when the establishment media called the election for Biden despite President Trump contesting the results in multiple swing states, Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue congratulated the former vice president.

“We congratulate President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on having been declared the winners in this historic election,” Donohue said in a statement. “The U.S. Chamber stands ready to work with the Biden administration and leaders on both sides of the aisle to restore public health, revitalize our economy, and help rebuild American lives and communities.”

Likewise, the Business Roundtable has congratulated Biden. Both the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have served as the main hubs for the big business lobby’s globalist demands for years. Both supported the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Biden has said he will reconsider joining after Trump killed off the trade agreement.

“Business Roundtable congratulates President-elect Biden on his election as 46th President of the United States,” executives with the Business Roundtable wrote in a statement.

“We also congratulate Vice President-elect Harris on her historic accomplishment as the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected Vice President of the United States,” the group wrote.

Throughout Trump’s first term in office, his economic nationalist agenda — including tariffs on foreign imports and tightening the U.S. labor market — has been fiercely opposed by the big business lobby, Wall Street, and multinational corporations.

“Coleman shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the Legislature – or the governor,” the Kansas City Star editorial board wrote Friday.

The editorial board was referencing one of Coleman’s now-deleted tweets from last week, which allegedly said he could “call out a hit” on Democrat Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly.

But Kansas Democrats, who remain the minority in the legislature, will not get any help from Republicans to stop Coleman from assuming office.

Democrat lawmakers intend to file a complaint saying that Coleman is unfit to serve, but without Republican votes to back them up, the complaint will have nothing to stand on, according to the Star editorial board.

“I haven’t received a request to unseat him, but I think in a democracy we have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of our elections,” Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman, a Republican, said, according to the Star editorial board. “I’d be leery of an attempt to override the vote of the people.”

Coleman, a self-proclaimed progressive, tweeted Friday that Democrats “hate progressives more than they hate GOP.”

Agreed. Maybe instead of labeling me ""Unfit"" — Why not extend an olive branch and help me to BECOME ""fit"". The truth is, Democrats hate progressives more than they hate GOP. Explains why nobody has bothered to be the bigger person and give me a phone call as of yet. https://t.co/p0N5DpRoxz — Rep.-elect Aaron Coleman 🌹 (@Aaron4KS37) November 6, 2020

In September, Coleman used his ex-girlfriend’s accusations of abuse against him as a case for “Medicare for All.”

Taylor Passow, Coleman’s ex-girlfriend, alleged that while they were still dating, he slapped her and attempted to choke her once during an argument in December 2019, the Intercept reported.

“While it is true I was abusive to my ex-girlfriend, I do not agree with the characterization being made about our experience in the hot tub the day after Christmas,” Coleman wrote in a statement on Sunday. “I did not choke her. I also don’t think she is intentionally lying, as I know large quantities of alcohol could be affecting both of our memories.”

Coleman defeated two write-in challengers last Tuesday, including Democrat incumbent Rep. Stan Frownfelter."

Van Drew: Party Switch Risk ‘Worth It’ — ‘The Democratic Party Has Changed a Great Deal’,"Representative Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), who left the Democratic Party in 2019 after President Donald Trump’s impeachment, said the risk he took in swapping parties was “worth it” after winning his reelection bid.

Van Drew attributed his win despite switching parties to the “progressive, extreme, radical people that are controlling” the Democratic Party.

“The risk was worth it, essentially because — really to condense it down — the Democratic Party has changed a great deal, and it’s changing more,” Van Drew told FNC’s “Fox & Friends. “And you saw that by even the number of moderates that lost in this last election right here who were Democrats. And that’s going to continue because whatever they try to do and whatever they say, at the end of the day, it is very progressive, extreme, radical people that are controlling that party into the future, and that’s not what Americans want. Americans love their country.”

“And that’s what the election was about,” he continued. “It was about which path we were going to take: Mrs. [Amy] Kennedy’s path, which was a radical path, which was one that, you know, believed in the Green New Deal, believed in defunding police, believed in sanctuary cities, believed in open borders, believed in not supporting our military, or was it the path of a strong and good America that we love, that we can make even better. We can always make it better, but that we support this great and wonderful nation, a nation that we should be proud of. That was one of the most important points of the entire election.”

The November 8th episode of Family Guy, titled “La Famiglia Guy,” began with Peter and Lois Griffin reading newspapers announcing Trump’s suicide.

Watch below via MRC

“God, can you believe Trump hung himself in prison?” Peter asks, before the words “We wrote this in February 2019. Were we right?” flash at the bottom of screen.

“I know! And that Chris Christie lost all that weight,” adds Lois. “He still looks terrible, though.”

“See? We don’t hate all Republicans,” then flashes up on the screen. “But we do hate Chris Christie.”

Later on in the episode, Brian is reading the newspaper where he reveals that Mike Pence hung himself after coming out as a homosexual.

“God, I can’t believe Mike Pence came out of the closet just before he hung himself in prison.” Brain reads with a caption again appearing on the screen again, saying: “Again, we wrote this in February 2019. Did we nail it?”

Finally, Peter’s friend Quagmire is also is also seen reading a newspaper where he announces the death of Melania Trump back in her home country of Slovenia.

“God, I can’t believe Melania was deported to Slovenia and then hung herself in a European prison,” he says. The words over the screen read: “Okay, now we’re done.”

Family Guy, whose creator Seth MacFarlane has donated millions to the Democratic Party over the past 15 years, has long lampooned Trump. Last year, the show depicted Trump sexualizing his daughter Ivanka and saying she has a “beautiful rack.”

Family Guy is not the only FOX comedy to depict president Trump’s allies hanging themselves. In an April 2017 episode, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer was seen hanging in the briefing room.

“I know a lot of people don’t like him, but I thought the guy was at least an optimist. I am not as optimistic as he was. I look at it like, ‘there’s bad people on both sides,'” said Chappelle on SNL. “Called the coronavirus the kung flu. I said, you racist, hilarious son of a bitch. I’m supposed to say that, not you. It’s wrong when you say it.”

Watch Below:

“Trump getting the coronavirus was like Freddy Mercury getting AIDS. Nobody was like ‘Well how did he get it?'” Chappelle joked, referring to the late British lead singer of the band Queen.

Chappelle, still riffing on coronavirus, targeted “poor white people” who “don’t like wearing masks,” saying “What is the problem? You wear a mask at the Klan rally, wear it at the Walmart too. Wear your Klan hood at Walmart so we can all feel safe.”

In September, the Chappelle Show star blasted critics after winning an Emmy award for best Variety Special on Netflix, telling them to, “shut the fuck up, forever.”

“Boy, this comes as a complete surprise,” said Chappelle during his acceptance speech. “I mean, I read all the reviews and they said so many terrible things. They were embarrassed for me, I had lost my way, it wasn’t even worth watching — I hope all you critics learn from this. This is a teachable moment. Shut the fuck up, forever.”

Last year, Chappelle defended freedom of speech, stating that “the First Amendment is first for a reason.”

“The First Amendment is first for a reason. The Second Amendment is just in case the first one doesn’t work out,” said Chappelle while accepting the prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, honoring achievements in the field of comedy.

“The country’s getting a little tight. It doesn’t feel like it’s ever felt in my lifetime,” he added.

Chapppelle ended his monologue on a serious, urging the audience that supports Joe Biden to be “humble winners” and that “half the country” is feeling like they’ve lost.

“The women of color showed up in big ways. Of course, you saw in Georgia what Black women have done, but Latina women are the real heroines here beating men in turnout in every state and voting for Biden-Harris at an average rate close to three to one,” the Desperate Housewives star said during an appearance on MSNBC.

“And that wasn’t surprising to use because Latinas are the CEOs of the households. They make all the financial decisions and healthcare decisions and educational decisions. Many Latinas are small business owners and they wanted a plan for recovery for themselves — not for Wall Street. Trump’s policies were never aimed at the struggling Latina community,” Eva Longoria said who campaigned for Joe Biden in Kissimmee, Florida, in October.

Longoria’s comments prompted a mountain of backlash across social media.

“And THIS is why I don’t linger in the ‘people of color’ group that society has been boxing us into. Give them a chance & they never miss the opportunity to minimize the efforts and accomplishments of Black people,” one user responded. “We are not the same. How dare she.”

“yal can cancel Eva Longoria if you want to and RIGHTFULLY SO but I will not cancel Desperate Housewives,” another added, encouraging people to “dragggg her.”

“Black women overwhelmingly voted Biden, Latinas did not and especially not Latino men. That comment about Latinas being ‘the real heroine’ was very unnecessary,” another said.

Longoria issued an apology in response to the backlash.

“I’m so sorry and sad to hear that my comments on MSNBC could be perceived as taking credit from Black women,” she said in a statement. “When I said that Latinas were heroines in this election, I simply meant that they turned out in greater numbers and voted more progressively than LATINO MEN.”

“There is such a history in our community of anti-Blackness in our community and I would never want to contribute to that, so let me be very clear,” Longoria continued, referring to black women as the longtime “backbone of the Democratic Party” and concluding that they “don’t have to do it alone any longer.”

He looked and sounded the part of a senior statesman, impeccably suited and groomed and with an authoritative voice any politician would covet. He commanded his turf — the quiz show’s stage — but refused to overshadow its brainy contestants.

And when he faced the challenge of pancreatic cancer, which claimed his life Sunday at age 80, he was honest, optimistic and graceful. Trebek died at his Los Angeles home, surrounded by family and friends, “Jeopardy!” studio Sony said.

The Canadian-born host made a point of informing fans about his health directly, in a series of brief online videos. He faced the camera and spoke in a calm, even tone as he revealed his illness and hope for a cure in the first message, posted in March 2019.

“Now normally, the prognosis for this is not very encouraging, but I’m going to fight this and I’m going to keep working,” Trebek said, even managing a wisecrack: He had to beat the disease because his “Jeopardy!” contract had three more years to run.

Trebek’s death came less than four months after that of civil rights leader and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, also of advanced pancreatic cancer and at age 80. Trebek had offered him words of encouragement last January.

In a memoir published this year, “The Answer Is … Reflections on My Life,” Trebek suggested that he’s known but not celebrated, and compared himself to a visiting relative who TV viewers find “comforting and reassuring as opposed to being impressed by me.”

That was contradicted Sunday by the messages of grief and respect from former contestants, celebrities and the wider public that quickly followed news of his loss.

“Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did. He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I’m grateful for every minute I got to spend with him,” tweeted “Jeopardy!” champion Ken Jennings. “Thinking today about his family and his Jeopardy! family — which, in a way, included millions of us.”

“It was one of the great privileges of my life to spend time with this courageous man while he fought the battle of his life. You will never be replaced in our hearts, Alex,” James Holzhauer, another “Jeopardy!” star, posted on Twitter.

Recent winner Burt Thakur tweeted that he was “overwhelmed with emotion.” When he appeared on Friday’s show, Thakur recounted learning English diction as a child from watching Trebek on “Jeopardy!” with his grandfather.

The program tapes weeks of shows in advance, and the remaining episodes with Trebek will air through Dec. 25, a Sony spokeswoman said.

“Jeopardy!” bills itself as “America’s favorite quiz show” and captivated the public with a unique format in which contestants were told the answers and had to provide the questions on a variety of subjects, including movies, politics, history and popular culture.

They would answer by saying “What is … ?” or “Who is …. ?”

Trebek, who became its host in 1984, was a master of the format, engaging in friendly banter with contestants, appearing genuinely pleased when they answered correctly and, at the same time, moving the game along in a brisk no-nonsense fashion whenever people struggled for answers.

“I try not to take myself too seriously,” he told an interviewer in 2004. “I don’t want to come off as a pompous ass and indicate that I know everything when I don’t.”

The show was the brainstorm of Julann Griffin, wife of the late talk show host-entrepreneur Merv Griffin, who said she suggested to him one day that he create a game show where people were given the answers.

“Jeopardy!” debuted on NBC in 1964 with Art Fleming as emcee and was an immediate hit. It lasted until 1975, then was revived in syndication with Trebek.

Long identified by a full head of hair and trim mustache (though in 2001 he startled viewers by shaving his mustache, “completely on a whim”), Trebek was more than qualified for the job, having started his game show career on “Reach for the Top” in his native country.

Moving to the U.S. in 1973, he appeared on “The Wizard of Odds,” “High Rollers,” “The $128,000 Question” and “Double Dare.” Even during his run on “Jeopardy!”, Trebek worked on other shows. In the early 1990s, he was the host of three — “Jeopardy!”, “To Tell the Truth” and “Classic Concentration.”

“Jeopardy!” made him famous. He won five Emmys as its host, including one last June, and received stars on both the Hollywood and Canadian walks of fame. In 2012, the show won a prestigious Peabody Award.

He taped his daily “Jeopardy!” shows at a frenetic pace, recording as many as 10 episodes (two weeks’ worth) in just two days. After what was described as a mild heart attack in 2007, he was back at work in just a month.

He posted a video in January 2018 announcing he’d undergone surgery for blood clots on the brain that followed a fall he’d taken. The show was on hiatus during his recovery.

It had yet to bring in a substitute host for Trebek — save once, when he and “Wheel of Fortune” host Pat Sajak swapped their TV jobs as an April’s Fool prank.

In 2012, Trebek acknowledged that he was considering retirement, but had been urged by friends to stay on so he could reach 30 years on the show. He still loved the job, he declared: “What’s not to love? You have the security of a familiar environment, a familiar format, but you have the excitement of new clues and new contestants on every program. You can’t beat that!”

Although many viewers considered him one of the key reasons for the show’s success, Trebek himself insisted he was only there to keep things moving.

“My job is to provide the atmosphere and assistance to the contestants to get them to perform at their very best,” he said in a 2012 interview. “And if I’m successful doing that, I will be perceived as a nice guy and the audience will think of me as being a bit of a star. But not if I try to steal the limelight!”

In a January 2019 interview with The Associated Press, Trebek discussed his decision to keep going with “Jeopardy!”

“It’s not as if I’m overworked — we tape 46 days a year,” he said. But he acknowledged he would retire someday, if he lost his edge or the job was no longer fun, adding: “And it’s still fun.”

Born July 22, 1940, in Sudbury, Ontario, Trebek was sent off to boarding school by his Ukrainian father and French-Canadian mother when he was barely in his teens.

After graduating high school, he spent a summer in Cincinnati to be close to a girlfriend, then returned to Canada to attend college. After earning a philosophy degree from the University of Ottawa, he went to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Co., starting as a staff announcer and eventually becoming a radio and TV reporter.

He became a U.S. citizen in 1997. Trebek’s first marriage, to Elaine Callei, ended in divorce. In 1990, he married Jean Currivan, and they had two children, Emily and Matthew.

Trebek is survived by his wife, their two children and his stepdaughter, Nicky."

Behar said, “I did have a — we had champagne, and we all had a great time with some friends in a safe environment, but, you know, a couple of things. Number one, if we were going to cheat or if there was going to be any kind of fraud, why not do it in the Senate also? Why just the presidency? Might as well take the whole enchilada, so they’re completely illogical right there.”

She continued, “Second thing, I would like to congratulate you, Whoopi, having spent four years, and you never mentioned his name once. I think you should get an Emmy for the best non-spoken word. OK? That’s another thing. Or a Grammy rather. Actually, it’s a Grammy. I feel like, you know, this morning I said to Steve, what is that Superman always said? Truth, justice and the American way is back. It’s back. You know, I don’t think that people understand. Today everybody should be happy because just picture in your mind what it could have been if he had won. It would have been the end of this country. It would have been the end of democracy. And I am not exaggerating. I am not exaggerating. I believe in truth. He starts out lying, and he would just continue for another four years.

Bloomberg reports that tech giant Apple has temporarily suspended new business with its iPhone assembler Pegatron after discovering labor violations at a student workers’ program. Apple is reportedly taking a strong stance on the issue and working to clean up a Chinese-based production chain that has long been accused of worker abuse.

Apple claimed that several weeks ago it discovered that the Taiwanese manufacturer misclassified student workers and allowed some to work nights and overtime which violates Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Employees reportedly “went to extraordinary lengths” to cover up the violations. Pegatron has since been placed on probation by Apple until corrective action is completed.

Pegatron is just o be of a handful of partners that Apple relies on to assemble its high tech products including the iPhone. The Taiwanese company is an integral part of Apple’s global supply chain alongside larger plants such as Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Apple’s supply chain has long been criticized by labor activists for poor working conditions, likely leading to the company swift action over student workers being misclassified.

In a statement, Apple said:

Pegatron misclassified the student workers in their program and falsified paperwork to disguise violations of our Code, including allowing students to work nights and/or overtime and in some cases to perform work unrelated to their major. The individuals at Pegatron responsible for the violations went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms.

GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu commented on the situation stating: “Pegatron’s current iPhone business should not be affected. However, it is likely that Pegatron will lose some orders for Apple’s new handsets next year to Luxshare, which is poised to become a new iPhone assembler in 2021.”

A Pegatron spokesperson stated on Monday: “We are working on the corrective actions and are confident that we will complete it soon.” Pegatron commented on their efforts to remedy the situation stating: “Upon discovery of this non-compliant activity, we immediately took the student workers off production lines and worked with our customer and third-party experts to make appropriate arrangements for them to return to their homes or schools with proper compensation alongside all necessary support and care.”

Mashable reports that tech giant Facebook has announced plans to prevent the spread of what it considers misinformation within the groups on its platform. Facebook will now put certain Facebook Groups in “probation” periods of 60 days. During this timeframe, all posts in the groups must be manually approved by a group administrator or moderator in an attempt to have them take responsibility for the content posted in the groups.

If Facebook finds that many of a group’s posts violate its community standards policies, the group could face a probationary period. All groups on the platform will be subject to these new rules, whether they are public or private.

If the groups continue to violate Facebook policies during the probationary period, the company will ban the group. Facebook previously announced a version of this new policy in relation to Groups in September. The updated policy appears to include a longer probation period.

Currently, administrators and moderators can control what content is allowed within their groups, but moderation of any sort is completely up to the moderators and admins. If they choose not to remove any posts featuring misinformation then their group could be at risk as part of this new Facebook Groups policy.

Breitbart News recently reported that Facebook has announced that it plans to demote content “our systems predict may be misinformation” relating to election fraud. A Facebook spokesperson told Forbes that the social media company is “seeing more reports of inaccurate claims about the election” and “while many of these claims have low engagement on our platform, we are taking additional temporary steps.”

The spokesperson told Forbes that Facebook would be taking a number of actions including “demotions for content on Facebook and Instagram that our systems predict may be misinformation, including debunked claims about voting” and “limiting the distribution of Live videos that may relate to the election on Facebook.”

166,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/11/09/gop-senators-demand-google-answer-report-alleging-election-interference/,GOP Senators Demand Google Answer Report Alleging Election Interference,"Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to Google demanding answers over a study by psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein pointing to potential election interference by the tech giant.

An ongoing study by Epstein, who has been exploring the links between biased search results and election outcomes for over five years now, discovered signs that Google was sending get-out-the-vote reminders to Democrats while excluding Republicans for a number of days ahead of the election.

The early results of Epstein’s work are quoted in the Senators’ letter to Google (emphasis ours):

In our election monitoring project this year, we recruited a politically-diverse group of 733 field agents in Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina. Through their computers, we were able to preserve more than 400,000 ephemeral experiences that tech companies use to shift opinions and votes and that normally are lost forever. One of our most disturbing findings so far is that between Monday, October 26th (the day our system became fully operational) and Thursday, October 29th, only our liberal field agents received vote reminders on Google’s home page. Conservatives did not receive even a single vote reminder. This kind of targeting, if present nationwide, could shift millions of votes, in part because Google’s home page is seen 500 million times a day in the U.S. The good news is that it appears that we got Google to stop this manipulation four days before Election Day. On Thursday, October 29th, I sent materials about the monitoring project to Ebony Bowden, a reporter at the New York Post, who was writing a story about the project. I did so knowing that all nypost.com emails are shared with algorithms and employees at Google. Late night on the 29th, two notable things happened: First, Ms. Bowden’s article, which was about possible large-scale election rigging by Big Tech, was pulled by the Post. Second, Google’s targeted messaging stopped completely. From midnight on the 29th to the end of Election Day, all of our field agents have received the vote reminder. Because of the demographics of the people who use Google, this is still a vote manipulation, but it is far more benign than the extreme targeting we detected last week.

The full letter can be accessed below, or at this link.

In their letter to Google, the Senators asserted that previous assurances provided by the company of its political neutrality are not true.

“Based on Dr. Epstein’s response, it would appear your assertion that ‘We won’t do any work, you know, to politically tilt anything one way or the other’ is not true,” wrote the senators.

NBC News reports that users on the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok have begun prank calling a hotline for voter fraud started by President Trump’s reelection campaign making false claims and reports in an attempt to clog up the lines. President Trump’s reelection campaign set up the hotline for people to report any suspicious activity near their voting stations.

The President’s son, Eric Trump, tweeted about the hotline on Twitter, stating: “Help stop voter suppression, irregularities and fraud.”

Almost immediately TikTok users began calling the hotline to report misinformation. Alex Hirsch, the creator of the Disney Channel series Gravity Falls, also posted videos of himself calling the hotline as various characters from his show.:

I’m don’t want to tell anyone what to do, but if you felt like calling this number and, say, reporting the Hamburglar, I can confirm from personal experience that it would be very funny https://t.co/GIRoHn6jAa — Alex Hirsch (@_AlexHirsch) November 7, 2020

Hahaha can hear how exhausted they are already pic.twitter.com/zoa4HiLaEj — Alex Hirsch (@_AlexHirsch) November 7, 2020

In one video, Hirsch tells operators: “I went in there and I had a big ol’ sack and I just started taking ballots out of the box, and, you know, I didn’t even try to hide it.”

In one TikTok video posted by the user cheesecaseacita, the young woman calls the line telling operators that her name is “Mary.” When a member of the Trump National War Room who identifies himself as Ricardo answers the call and asks what sort of voter fraud she saw, the TikToker replies: “I saw people were literally spreading poop all over their ballots.”

Another user named caitlynjk95 posted a video in which she appears to call the line, identifying herself as a voter in Georgia before telling the operator: “I was in line to vote and, like, there was this guy there, and I don’t know that this is considered fraud or anything, but he was there and he challenged me to a fiddle competition,” a reference to the song “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” by the Charlie Daniels Band. The operator replies that the situation is “very interesting.”

Lara Trump has since tweeted a new number for the hotline, challenging prank callers “Keep spamming. We will keep changing the number.”

Another new number 👇🏽 To those who have spammed our other numbers: it’s shameful that you don’t think it’s important to have integrity in our elections. It’s fundamental to our republic. Keep spamming. We will keep changing the number. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/ILPJrqG42D — Lara Trump (@LaraLeaTrump) November 7, 2020

Breitbart News reported earlier this month that a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok cannot yet be shut down by an executive order from the Trump administration. The judge granted a preliminary injunction against a number of bans by the U.S. Commerce Department that were scheduled to go into effect on November 12.

If the ban went into effect, the app would seemingly become unusable by restricting web hosting, content delivery, and more. TikTok is suing the Trump administration and Commerce Department in an attempt to block the ban but the latest ruling came from another lawsuit.

170,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/11/09/wikipedia-saw-election-day-traffic-spike-on-censored-hunter-biden-page/,Wikipedia Saw Election Day Traffic Spike on Censored Hunter Biden Page,"Page view statistics on Wikipedia indicated that on the day of the U.S. Presidential election, which hinges on mere thousands of votes in key states, the page on Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden saw an additional 66,000 views for 110,000 views total. Readers of the page would see allegations of him having corrupt foreign business dealings called “debunked conspiracy theories” and, due to editors censoring the page, find no mention of recent New York Post bombhells on apparent Biden e-mails lending credence to corruption allegations.

The similarly censored Wikipedia page for Joe Biden saw an Election Day spike of 360,000 views, while the negatively slanted page on President Donald Trump saw 150,000 additional views that day. Such traffic in a marginal election outcome shows the potential electoral impact of Wikipedia’s left-wing bias, a bias which earlier this year caused its co-founder to declare the death of the site’s “neutrality” policy.

A tool gauging traffic on Hunter Biden’s page on Wikipedia shows that on November 3, 2020, the article on Biden received a little over 110,000 views. This was an uptick from around 44,000 views the previous day, for a total increase of about 66,000 views. While the traffic counter does not identify the source of traffic to determine if viewers were coming from a particular area, the spike in views alone is well in excess of the margins in several key states.

Before Election Day, similar spikes were only seen following significant developments with Biden, such as the initial New York Post reporting on the allegations when traffic spiked by nearly 80,000 views. Following the final Presidential debate where the corruption allegations figured prominently, there was a traffic spike of nearly the same size as Election Day. Viewing traffic remained high for most of the last weeks of the campaign after the Post‘s reporting with the day before the election being its lowest point.

If these tens of thousands of readers were looking to the page to determine whether to vote for Hunter Biden’s father, the former Vice President, then they would likely come away with an initial impression favoring a vote for the Democrat. The introduction to Hunter Biden’s page at the time described the corruption allegations against him and the Biden family as “debunked conspiracy theories” propagated by President Trump. More significantly, the page contains no mention of the Post’s reporting casting doubt on Biden family denials about the allegations or subsequent confirmations of that reporting by other outlets.

Editors on Wikipedia actively censored the Post’s reporting from many pages relating to the allegations, including on Biden’s page. Initial discussion on including the allegations claimed the Post was “unreliable” and suggested the laptop reportedly containing the e-mails was fabricated. Guy Chapman, an administrator with special privileges on the site who previously called for banning Trump supporters from Wikipedia, baselessly suggesting the e-mails originated with Russian intelligence. Later attempts to mention it were removed as editors dismissed the story’s credibility. Removing description of the allegations as “conspiracy theories” on Biden’s page has also been repeatedly rejected with editors invoking baseless claims of Russian involvement.

Wikipedia’s page on Joe Biden also saw a significant uptick in views on Election Day. On that day, former Vice President Biden’s page received over 360,000 additional views with around 576,000 total views coming off smaller spikes in the two preceding days from an end of October count of nearly 118,000 views. His largely positive page has also been censored of the Post‘s reporting as Chapman closed down one discussion on mentioning the allegations suggesting they were part of “a standard Kremlin disinformation operation.” No mention of related allegations was included on the page save two paragraphs buried in the article claiming no evidence of wrongdoing.

President Trump’s page saw an Election Day traffic spike of about 150,000 views to nearly 300,000. Unlike Biden’s page, Trump’s was heavily slanted against him at the time with the introduction characterizing him as “racist” and as making “many false or misleading statements” along with other attacks. On the coronavirus pandemic, a potentially decisive election issue, the introduction makes no mention of his fast-tracking of treatments, early travel ban on China, or stimulus packages fueling a record-setting economic recovery, but instead is wholly negative on his response. The introduction also uncritically repeats Democrat spin on the Russia collusion and impeachment allegations, which have been part of repeated Wikipedia smear campaigns against the President.

A major reason for this bias in coverage, with pages on the Bidens largely defensive and censored and Trump’s heavily negative, is editors invoking Wikipedia’s policies on “verifiability” to purge conservative media. The Post was declared unreliable by editors in September, a month before its Hunter Biden reporting, and Fox News was discouraged as a source for politically contentious material in July. Both Fox and the Daily Caller, banned from use as a source last year, corroborated the Post’s reporting. However, these rulings against all three outlets meant the reporting and corroboration of it were kept out of every article. Reporting from Sinclair that Hunter Biden was the subject of an FBI money-laundering investigation was similarly suppressed.

By contrast, Wikipedia is heavily reliant on left-wing media as they have deemed them “reliable sources” and even shut down discussions formally challenging them within a day of what is normally a month-long discussion in one case. Analyses have shown the top news sources on Wikipedia are left-wing outlets, such as the Guardian, and that most news outlets cited on articles about American politicians exhibit a left-wing bias. Whether due to the purging of conservative media or administrative bias, editors with right-leaning views have been shown by one analysis to be six times more likely to be sanctioned and thus diminishing their participation in article discussions.

One example of administrative bias is Muboshgu, an administrator who locked pages relating to the Biden corruption allegations to keep in material attacking the allegations and threatened editors presenting them as credible. Muboshgu dismissed the allegations as “Russian disinformation” shortly after the Post story broke. This put him in conflict with Wikipedia policies prohibiting administrators using their privileges to favor their side in a dispute. Muboshgu also created a “Russian interference in the 2020 elections” article citing speculation of interference and suggesting Trump’s complicity. The Post’s story was later placed there by another administrator. Only two days before the election, following thousands of page views, was it noted that no evidence supports claims of Russian involvement.

Studies found Wikipedia can have significant influence on human behavior. A 2019 study determined expanding Wikipedia pages on Spanish cities could increase hotel stays by as much as 33 percent. In 2013, a study found adding content to articles on companies could reduce negative investor sentiment. Regarding elections, a study on editing about German politicians found reason to examine Wikipedia’s potential impact on voting. Other than direct influence, Wikipedia also can influence readers of media outlets who copy Wikipedia content as media have done in significant degrees with the biased article on the GamerGate anti-corruption movement in gaming. Copying off Wikipedia has even caused media to spread hoaxes, including about Breitbart News.

Big Tech has also relied on Wikipedia with their censorship campaigns often dove-tailing. In addition to censoring Hunter Biden allegations where Facebook may have reduced reach of the Post’s stories by half and Twitter locking the outlet’s account for over two weeks, Wikipedia and Big Tech also censored the alleged name of the whistleblower behind Trump’s impeachment. One recent Senate report identified the alleged whistleblower as involved in a January 19th, 2016, meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors where the Hill’s John Solomon reported they discussed dropping corruption investigations into Burisma, an energy company where Hunter Biden was a board member, and having the FBI handle the investigation. Big Tech also actively suppressed conservative media, with Google dropping Breitbart traffic to zero for Joe Biden searches.

Mainstream media have praised Wikipedia, including for its handling of political articles in recent months such as their censoring of negative information on House Representative Karen Bass when she was speculated as Biden’s Vice Presidential pick (editors also sanitized the page on ultimate pick Kamala Harris). Praise has focused on the site as a counter to “fake news” in a message pushed by Wikipedia’s owner following advice from a public relations firm run by Head of Communications for the Clinton Foundation. Wikipedia editors favoring the Biden campaign is one example of the left-wing bias at the site its co-founder has criticized with others being editors supporting Antifa and Black Lives Matter.

T. D. Adler edited Wikipedia as The Devil’s Advocate. He was banned after privately reporting conflict of interest editing by one of the site’s administrators. Due to previous witch-hunts led by mainstream Wikipedians against their critics, Adler writes under an alias."

Cotton and Loeffler urged Attorney General William Barr to swiftly address potential violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

According to a report by Campus Reform, Senators Tom Cotton and Kelly Loeffler are urging the Department of Justice to investigate universities and colleges that may be operating in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the letter, the senators write:

“I write to bring your attention to an alarming trend of apparent racial segregation in schools in the United States. These cases appear to violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in federally funded programs or activities,” the letter reads. “I urge the Department of Justice to investigate these and similar cases as part of our nation’ s commitment to equality before the law.”

The letter cites two discussion group events that were held at the University of Michigan. During the discussions, students were separated based on their race.

On September 8, the Center for Social Justice and Inclusion at the University of Michigan- Dearborn hosted two virtual “cafes,” or online discussion groups, that were segregated on the basis of race, with moderators also segregated on the basis of race. The cafes were advertised as opportunities for students ‘ ‘to gather and discuss their experience” on campus and in the world as members of a particular racial group.

Breitbart News reported in February 2018 that Stanford University had banned male students from the gym during certain hours of the week. University of Michigan, Flint, Professor Mark J. Perry argued that the policy violated the university’s own commitment to non-discrimination.

Renames English Department in Campaign Against Racism,"Cornell University announced this week that its faculty has voted to change the name of the English department as part of a broader campaign to eradicate “structural forms” of racism at the university. The department will now be referred to as the “department of literatures in English.”

According to a report by Campus Reform, Cornell University has voted to change the name of its English department in response to a campaign by faculty members. The name was changed from “English department” to the “department of literatures in English” as part of a broader effort to eradicate racism on campus.

Professor Carol Boyce-Davies, an author of the original proposal to change the department’s name, said that the proposal was inspired by the Black Lives Matters protests that erupted in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death. According to a report by the Cornell student newspaper, the decision was supported by 75 percent of university faculty members.

“Faculty around the country — not just faculty of color, but faculty in general — began to look at the institution to see how we can help advance a discourse that challenges structural forms of racism which get reproduced in students and in teaching over and over again,” Boyce-Davies said in a short comment.

The change may not be a surprise to members of the Cornell community. Cornell President Martha Pollack said back in May that the university would use its educational programs to eradicate racism in the United States.

“We will address it directly in our educational programs, in our research and in our engagement and related activities, working through the ways we know best to push for a world that is equitable and kind; where people do not have to fear for their lives because of the color of their skin; and where everyone has the same opportunities to grow, thrive and enjoy their lives,” Pollack said.

Breitbart News reported in September that the faculty coalition at the university demanded a racial breakdown of faculty spouses.

Students at the university’s Fallowfield campus awoke to find the fences being erected around the grounds, without warning, and with no way to pass them apart from one exit guarded by security.

Late in the afternoon, the university sent an email to the student body seen by The Guardian telling them that “security staff will ensure that only students who live in that accommodation can access safely and help avoid the mixing of households”, and that security may ask them to see their identity documents into order to enter their rooms.

“I don’t understand why they need to put up fences to keep us safe from the virus. It makes us feel like they don’t trust us, it feels like they’re locking us in our rooms,” one student told the newspaper.

That night, hundreds of students gathered to protest the restrictions and tore down the fencing.

Students present at the protest told the BBC that they had been blocked off from accessing green spaces on campus, saying the university felt like a “prison”, with some referring to it as “HMP [Her Majesty’s Prison] Fallowfield”.

University administrators said it had erected the fencing over concerns of non-students accessing campus buildings and to “help avoid the mixing of households”. But the University of Manchester later apologised to its students and pledged to remove any remaining barriers on Friday.

The protest came as England went into full lockdown on Thursday, Guy Fawkes Night, with non-essential shops closed and the mixing of households banned.

Tensions had boiled over in another part of the country, when in Merseyside revellers clashed with police on the last night of freedom. When police tried to break up celebrations on the eve before bonfire night, several young people launched fireworks at officers, though none were injured.

There is growing disquiet over the British government’s lockdown strategy, with Million Mask March protesters, many wearing the Guy Fawkes masks made famous by the movie V for Vendetta, descending on Trafalgar Square in London.

The Daily Mail reports that many shouted “freedom” and “take our country back”, with banners reading, “no more lockdown”. Police said they made more than 100 arrests, the majority of which for breaching coronavirus laws.

Poppy wreaths lain to honour the fallen in Ross-on-Wye, Britain’s “best-loved market town”, for example, were found to have been ripped off the town memorial and tossed in nearby flowerbeds in an act of desecration former mayor Phil Cutter branded “a disgrace”.

“Somehow this has got to be stopped,” he implored.

“I know the police are absolutely pushed and I fully support them, but I feel that when they are going on and off shift and when they are in Ross, parking up their vehicle they could just literally do a walk,” he suggested.

“That might help. Some of the general public are going to see what they can do about reporting these things,” he added.

In Lawley, Telford, meanwhile, the parish council has appealed for people to donate to the Poppy Appeal, a nationally prominent charity drive with strong links to Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, after the roll of honour on its own memorial was defaced.

“We would like to express our sincere thanks to residents that have commented on the damage done to the war memorial who are clearly as angry as we are about it and have offered to contribute towards its repair,” commented council chairman Raj Mehta.

“We are deeply moved by the community spirit being shown and thank you all for your offers.

“If people wish to make a donation to the Poppy Appeal in lieu of any contributions to ourselves, then I am sure they would be very gratefully received, especially this year when fundraising has been badly affected,” he said, referencing the difficulties have experienced raising money due to various anti-coronavirus lockdown measures this year.

Even the remote Isle of Lewis, home of Donald Trump’s Scottish mother, Mary, has seen vandalism, with lights surrounding its war memorial destroyed shortly before the traditional but coronavirus-curtailed Remembrance Sunday ceremony on November 8th.

“Given the amount of engagement with communities throughout the islands at the time of the 100-year commemoration of the Iolaire disaster, this is extremely disappointing and displays a callous lack of respect to the memory of those who served their country,” commented Western Isles Council convenor Norman A Macdonald, referencing a maritime tragedy in which 200 veterans returning to their island home after the First World War were lost at sea on New Year’s Day 1919, within sight of the island’s inhabitants.

“It’s especially disappointing to see this act of vandalism so close to Remembrance Day,” added Alasdair Allan, who represents the Western Isles in the Scottish Parliament.

“The islands suffered a higher proportion of losses in World War I than most other areas of the UK. Our war memorials are a tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice,” the MSP added.

The spate of vandalism comes as academics and race activists are pushing for various aspects of Britain’s past and its memorialisation in the form of statues and monuments to be reevaluated in the wake of the recent Black Lives matter unrest.

However, no evidence has been disclosed linking the above incidents to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has desecrated a number of monuments including the iconic Cenotaph national war memorial in London in recent months.

I refer, of course, not to the British Prime Minister’s well-practised performance in the bedroom but to his outburst — his ejaculation*, if you will — on Twitter over the weekend when he congratulated Joe Biden on ‘his election as President of the United States.’

(*Oxford English Dictionary: 2. dated Something said quickly and suddenly.)

This ejaculation is premature, unseemly and could turn out to be very messy.

Whoops. May be a bit premature fat boy. Perhaps that would explain all your kids though… — Moriarty (@LeProfMoriarty) November 7, 2020

Sure, it is possible that Joe Biden may end up the next President of the USA. But it’s also possible, pending legal claims and recounts, that he may not. That decision will be made next month when the Electoral College meets. Contrary to current fashionable belief, the presidency is not decided and announced by the Mainstream Media, nor by Big Tech, nor does fake news suddenly become true when the British Prime Minister has tweeted it out with his fat fingers on his mobile phone. To act as if it does is a grave error on the part of Boris Johnson and, not for the first time in Johnson’s lamentable career, does his country a huge disservice.

One of the jobs of the British prime minister is to forge a healthy working relationship with whoever happens to be in the Oval Office. How, exactly, does Bojo think it will help if he sucks up to the left-wing candidate – who may yet prove the loser – while ignoring and insulting his more natural ally Donald Trump with whom he may have to deal with the next four years?

Still, perhaps we should be grateful to Johnson for confirming what some of us have long feared: that he is a fully signed up member of the Green Blob.

This claim in Johnson’s tweet that ‘climate change’ is one of the United Kingdom’s ‘shared priorities’ with the US…

Really? I wonder how many of the voters who gave Boris Johnson’s Conservatives their 80-seat majority at the last General Election did so in order to get higher electricity prices, more bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes ruining their favourite landscapes and seascapes, more green taxes and regulation.

Very few, I suspect. Britain did not vote Conservative so that the economy and the environment could be put in the hands of eco-fascist loons like Lord (‘Zac’) Goldsmith or Johnson’s current girlfriend, green activist Carrie Symonds.

Most British people currently have much, much bigger things to worry about than paying homage to the Carbon Fairy: the destruction of their jobs, their businesses and the economy by a supposedly Conservative government, for example.

Or is Boris so busy ejaculating all over his imaginary friend Joe Biden that he has failed to notice?"
182,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/11/09/boris-refuses-address-question-bidens-anti-brexit-position/,Boris Refuses to Address Question on Biden’s Anti-Brexit Position,"Boris Johnson refused to address a question on Joe Biden’s anti-Brexit position, but praised the prospect of “American global leadership in tackling climate change”.

After the media coronation, the British prime minister was eager to congratulate Joe Biden on his alleged victory, despite the results not being official, with vote counts ongoing and President Donald Trump declining to concede, alleging fraud.

Asked to remark on Biden having called Boris Johnson a “physical and emotional clone” of President Trump and for having claimed Brexit was a mistake, the prime minister sidestepped completely, telling The Times: “I think there is far more that unites the government of this country and the government in Washington at any time and any stage than divides us.”

He also told the newspaper that he “very much” looks forward to working with “President Biden” in “tackling climate change, trade, international security, many, many other issues”.

“With President Biden in the White House… we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,” Prime Minister Johnson said.

As you can see from this clip, Biden hates the UK. The Conservatives had 4 years to do a trade deal with the USA and pro-UK President, and they failed. There is no chance now. pic.twitter.com/LjOSS8saz5 — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 7, 2020

Mr Johnson’s former prime ministerial rival, Sajid Javid, also looks forward to partnering with the Democrat on tackling alleged man-made climate change and supporting the World Health Organization, claiming there was “far more” mutual interest between a notionally conservative British government and a potential Democratic Biden presidency than “there ever was with a Trump administration”.

Mr Javid, who had held such high positions in government as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary, mentioned that the UK was hosting an upcoming climate summit, telling Sky News on Sunday that “with a new leader in the White House, we’ll have someone who will want to work with us to bring about change”.

Figures on the British political left were fawning over Biden and his election “win”. However, the love appeared not to be reciprocated, with a recent interaction highlighting the hostility that Biden still holds for the UK. When the liberal British Broadcasting Corporation asked Biden for a “quick word” for its viewers, the leftist American politician smirked and responded: “The BBC? I’m Irish.”

In response, Reform Party leader Nigel Farage, who is a friend of President Trump, remarked: “As you can see from this clip, Biden hates the UK.”

Mr Farage went on to criticise the Conservative government for failing for four years to strike a trade deal with the U.S. under a “pro-UK President”, Trump, adding: “There is no chance now.”

In September, British politicians had criticised Biden for interfering in UK-EU Brexit negotiations after the Democratic presidential candidate threatened to scupper a U.S.-UK trade deal over a British law safeguarding the Union which Brexit critics perceived to be a threat to the Good Friday agreement.

Douglas Murray warned in an article for the Mail on Sunday that Biden and the Democrats are “no friends” of Britain.

Mr Murray remarked: “Joe Biden and the Democrat high command loathe Brexit Britain. They believe that the Brexit movement had something to do with the election of Donald Trump – acting as some kind of forerunner. They instinctively connect the two.

“And they also hold a contemptuous, furious and deeply anti-British attitude to everything to do with our future relationship.”

The author also drew attention to a recent Twitter post by Gerry Adams, the former head of Northern Ireland’s anti-British Sinn Fein, widely regarded as the political wing of the IRA. He had tweeted congratulations to the Democrat, sharing a picture from three years ago of himself, Biden, and Rita O’Hare, who had attempted to murder a British army officer in 1971.

“Mr Biden is proud of his own Irish roots, and you get a picture of where his sympathies lie in a photograph that emerged yesterday,” Mr Murray remarked.

“Much of the British public may be glad to see Trump leave the White House. But his exit will be a bad day. We will have lost a friend. At a time when we needed friends the most,” he concluded."
184,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/09/coronavirus-greeks-must-ask-government-permission-via-text-to-leave-home/,Coronavirus: Greeks Must Ask Government Permission to Leave Home,"Greece launched its second nationwide coronavirus lockdown on Saturday. One of the rules is that citizens must text the government for permission to leave their homes, and permission will be granted only for work, physical fitness, and medical needs.

A government spokesman said on Monday that too many people are texting for permission to leave their homes and warned that “abuse” will be met with “strict inspections” and fines.

The Associated Press quoted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis explaining he wanted to impose drastic measures before Greece feels the full brunt of the “second wave” rolling across Europe, in part because the Greek health system is not prepared to handle a surge of hospitalizations:

Before the outbreak, Greece had one of the lowest rates of intensive-care beds per capita in Europe. It has since doubled the number to 1,013. But, of the 348 beds dedicated to coronavirus cases, only 128 remain unoccupied. It’s unlikely that number would’ve been enough to cope with what Mitsotakis said could be 1,000 new hospital admissions over the next 10 days, of which about 150 would likely have required ICU treatment. On Wednesday, Greece announced a record 18 daily deaths and 2,646 new cases bringing the total confirmed cases to just under 47,000 and deaths to 673 in this country of nearly 11 million. Greece’s rolling average of daily new cases is just over 17 per 100,000 people, as compared to 123 in Belgium and 47 in Italy. But the prime minister warned Greece also had less margin to respond.

“We must stop this wave. I chose once again to take drastic measures sooner rather than later,” Mitsotakis said.

“It could be the case that [less stringent] measures would have worked, but if they didn’t, then in 15 days the pressure that would have been exerted on the health system would be unbearable. That is something that, I will say it again, I can in no way allow,” he added.

Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Monday that the extremely tight lockdown is needed to “avert a worse crisis,” “save lives,” and “prevent the health system from becoming oversaturated.”

Petsas said the government would enforce the new lockdown more aggressively than it did in the spring. He expressed frustration at the over one million text messages officials have already received from citizens asking for permission to leave their homes to walk their pets or get some exercise, warning that “such abuse will be met with extended and strict inspections” – even though physical exercise and pet care are two of the reasons Greek citizens were explicitly told they could ask for permission to leave their homes.

“Instead of having to pay fines, everyone is urged to abide with instructions so that we exit the lockdown as quickly as possible,” Petsas said menacingly.

Petsas added that locking down for the month of November will hopefully lead to a “more normal Christmas holiday season” after the restrictions are lifted. Mitsotakis made the same point in a teleconference over the weekend.

“It’s in our hands, in the hands of all of us to be able to achieve this. I know that the next three weeks will be tough but I have no doubt that the measures we have taken will be adhered to by our fellow citizens and we will reduce the escalation of the second wave of the pandemic,” the prime minister said.

“Then, in a smart way, we can gradually begin to reopen economic and social activity in December, but having all received the message that this virus is constantly lurking, is a constant danger, we cannot afford to deal with it carelessly,” he said.

The new lockdown will shutter all retail stores except for those selling food and other vital necessities. Restaurants will only be allowed to open for deliveries. Unlike the spring lockdown, this time schools will remain open through the grade-school level, while high schools will employ remote learning procedures. The Greek border will not be closed, but everyone arriving in the country will be required to furnish proof of a recent negative coronavirus test.

Mitsotakis announced that workers suspended from their jobs will be given a stipend of 800 euros (about $950), which is 300 euros more than the stipend furnished by the government during the spring lockdown. Unemployment benefits will also be extended, while tax and loan payment deadlines will be extended.

Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said the new relief measures will cost about $3.9 billion, bringing Greece’s total expenses for the Wuhan coronavirus to over 6 percent of its Gross Domestic Product.

Mitsotakis said in October that it would be “very difficult, almost inconceivable,” for Greece or other European countries to impose more lockdowns.

“We can do localised lockdowns, we use contact tracing in a much smarter way, we do much more testing, but there is still a big question mark: can we manage to live with the virus while maintaining economic normality without a full lockdown and without putting too much strain on our healthcare system? I think no-one has the answer yet, because we still have three or four very difficult months [ahead of us],” he said last month.

Mitsotakis added that his government was “very optimistic” that it would be able to avoid the sort of draconian measures it ended up imposing a few weeks later but said no one could know for certain if such measures would be necessary.

Greece’s Radical Left Party (Syriza) last week accused Mitsotakis of failing to boost Greek health care systems before the second coronavirus wave hit, and said his administration has not done enough to protect businesses during this year’s 8.2 percent economic contraction.

“The government has undermined the magnitude of this crisis,” Syriza legislator Alexis Haritsis charged."

Mart Helme, co-founder of the Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE), left the Baltic NATO and EU member’s coalition government as a result of controversy around comments he made on TRE radio station.

The Estonian had suggested Biden was the beneficiary of a “deep state” which likes to “smuggle in scumbags — corrupt scumbags who can be blackmailed. Joe Biden and Hunter Biden are corrupt characters.”

He said that he believed Donald Trump “win eventually”, despite the currently projected results — but not without the possibility of civil conflict.

“It will happen as a result of an immense struggle, maybe even bloodshed, but justice will win in the end,” he predicted.

Mart Helme’s son, Martin Helme, who also serves in the Estonian government as Minister of Finance and chairs EKRE, agreed that the U.S. elections, as they stand, are not legitimate, saying: “In my opinion, there is no question that this election is rigged.”

“I think all normal people should speak out against it. There is no point in talking about any kind of democracy or the rule of law if elections can be so rudely, so blatantly and massively rigged,” he added, suggesting that “if [the result] goes through, if Trump is removed from power, then the Constitution will no longer apply in America”.

The EKRE politicians’ remarks went down poorly with Estonia’s prime minister, Jüri Ratas, whose centre party is much more left-leaning and does not share their antipathy towards the European Union and mass migration.

Ratas pleaded with his controversial coalition partners not to antagonise Biden — “a very favourable statesman” — in an English-language message shared on Facebook, congratulating the Democrat, praising the “fair, free, and transparent elections”, and admonishing them that “without evidence it is unacceptable to press heavy charges.”

The elder Helme decided to resign on Monday after “looking at the slander and lies produced by the Estonian media” about his comments.

“I am tired. I did nothing yesterday that would endanger Estonia’s security. I have not said anything that has not already been told by the American media, the American free media,” the 71-year-old added.

The younger Helme appears to be staying put, however, at least for the time being, claiming that he merely said what “the whole of the U.S. media is saying.”

“The [Estonian] press is not telling the Estonian people what the entire American media is saying, but I did it — election fraud,” he insisted.

Guy Fawkes Night, also referred to as Bonfire Night, is celebrated every year in the UK on November 5th and its closest weekend with fireworks, public bonfires, and burning effigies of political figures as well as the traditional Guy.

It commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot 0f 1605, when Catholic Robert Catesby and his co-conspirators, including Guy Fawkes, plotted to blow up King James I and Members of the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament on November 5th. Catesby planned the terror attack because the King did not support tolerance for Catholicism in the country.

.@ABC deleted this tweet…but the same BS story ran in multiple publications. https://t.co/2G5gQSfLlk pic.twitter.com/6y04Ht9znu — Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi) November 9, 2020

The conspirators were betrayed and the attack foiled, with Guy Fawkes being caught in Parliament’s cellar the day before, where 36 barrels of gunpowder had been planted. Others in the plot either died resisting arrest or were tried, found guilty of high treason, and executed.

Parliament then proclaimed that the 5th of November should be recognised, with the first Guy Fawkes celebrations taking place in 1606. The tradition of using fireworks represents the explosives that were never detonated under the Palace of Westminster. Guy Fawkes Night quickly spread to the American colonies, too, where since the 17th century it was known as Pope Day, though its celebration died out by the 19th century. Guy Fawkes Night is still held in New Zealand.

Fireworks and bonfire events can go on for days, particularly if the 5th falls on a weekday, with more displays held on the weekends. Celebrations are likely to be sporadic and ongoing this year, after England’s second lockdown came into effect on Thursday — Bonfire Night — which banned gatherings, likely resulting in Britons finding themselves with a surplus of pyrotechnics they could not use at parties.

Several U.S. news outlets, however, claimed that the fireworks the weekend just passed were for Joe Biden. Australian journalist Rita Panahi was one of several high-profile figures with a cursory knowledge of history to mock the likes of ABC News, which claimed: “Fireworks lit up the sky over London, England, after Joe Biden was characterised to be the apparent winner of the U.S. presidential election.” The erroneous tweet was later deleted.

“Fireworks were for Guy Fawkes/Bonfire Night, you ignorant imbeciles. Nothing to do with US election,” Ms Panahi wrote on social media on Sunday.

The Hill claimed that “leftover fireworks” from Guy Fawkes were being let off for the pro-Irish Democrat in their article entitled: “Fireworks in London, Edinburgh as Biden win celebrated abroad.”

CNN reported: “Even across the ocean, there was celebration. In London, fireworks. In Paris, church bells.”

Fox News declared that “Europe celebrates Biden win fireworks, church bells.”

Even the establishment Associated Press ran a fact-checker piece that labelled as “false” claims that French churches rang their bells on Saturday evening in celebration of a Biden ‘victory’. The Paris Diocese and the Diocese of Nanterre, a Parisien suburb, told the wire service that the claims were not true, and churches had not been instructed to ring their bells for Biden.

While France’s lockdown forbids public worship, the dioceses’ spokesmen said the bells of some churches were still automatically scheduled to call worshippers to Saturday evening service.

“This is the case for the bells of the Notre-Dame de l’Assomption church in Meudon, which can be seen and heard in a video shared on social media by a resident of the city,” the Diocese of Nanterre told AP. “As every Saturday evening at 5:45 pm, bells of Notre-Dame de l’Assomption church in Meudon rang to announce the Mass at 6 pm.”"

The Nats have invited Biden to toss out the ceremonial first ball next season on opening day. Washington is scheduled to host the New York Mets at Nationals Park on April 1.

“We’re excited to continue the long-standing tradition of sitting Presidents throwing out the first pitch at the home of the national pastime in our nation’s capital,” the team posted on Twitter this weekend.

Biden last threw out a first ball as vice president, in 2009 when the Baltimore Orioles hosted the New York Yankees on opening day at Camden Yards. The right-hander threw a high fastball that brought O’s catcher Chad Moeller out of his crouch.

Biden, a Little League shortstop who later played center, has frequently been around ballfields. He saw the Phillies a few times in the postseason, including the 2009 World Series, watched Philadelphia play at Washington in 2012, has visited the Yankees at spring training and attended the Little League World Series.

William Howard Taft began the tradition of presidents throwing out the first pitch in Washington in 1910. Since then, every sitting president except Donald Trump has thrown out a first pitch when Washington had a major league franchise.

Trump attended Game 5 of the 2019 World Series at Nationals Park and was booed when introduced as Houston played Washington.

Brees completed 26 of 32 passes for 222 yards in the 38-3 triumph Sunday night at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The Saints outgained the Buccaneers 420 to 194 in total yards.

“It’s about playing better and execution and we all have to do our jobs a lot better,” Brady told reporters. “When you play good teams there’s little margin for error. They’ve been a great team for a long time.

“They’ve got a lot of good players. If we’re going to beat them we’ve got to play a lot better than we did.”

The loss snapped Tampa Bay’s three-game winning streak. The Saints have now won five consecutive games and lead the NFC South.

Brady’s Buccaneers went three-and-out on the game’s opening possession before the Saints used a nine-play, 65-yard drive to take a 7-0 advantage. Brees threw a 14-yard touchdown toss to Tre’Quan Smith to end the drive.

Brees threw another touchdown to Saints tight end Adam Trautman at the end of the first quarter for a 14-0 edge.

Brees connected with Emmanuel Sanders for a 12-yard touchdown on the Saints first drive of the second quarter and Saints running back Alvin Kamara scored with 8:49 to go in the first half for a three-score lead. Saints kicker Wil Lutz later made a 36-yard field goal to give New Orleans a 31-0 lead at halftime.

Neither team scored in the third quarter, but Brees threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hill about six minutes into the final frame to push the Saints lead to 38-0.

Buccaneers kicker Ryan Succop made a 48-yard kick with 5:57 remaining for the final points of the night.

Brady completed 22 of 38 passes for 209 yards and failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in a game this season. The Buccaneers totaled eight rushing yards.

Malcolm Jenkins, David Onyemata and Marcus Williams each had interceptions for the Saints.

“I’d say these [performances] are rare, especially against as good a football team as the one we just played,” Brees said. “As many weapons as they have on the offensive side of the ball, our defense just played phenomenal, really contained and bottled up. The pass rush did a phenomenal job.

“I mean, really, it all starts there, I think on both sides of the ball. … So all the way around, it was a really solid performance by the entire team.”

Chris has been training every day for the past year for the Ironman. “The hardest part for him was the mental part of the race because 17 hours of anything is pretty grueling,” his father, Nik, said.

Despite suffering from ant bites and falling off his bike during the competition, Chris never gave up.

“He finished the last 60-70 miles of the bike injured and itching,” his dad explained.

In a Facebook post on Saturday, Ironman officials congratulated Chris, writing, “We are beyond inspired, and your accomplishment is a defining moment in IRONMAN history that can never be taken away from you.”

Coach Dan Grieb was with him every step of the way.

“When it was over, I told him I loved him. That he’s now an Ironman and that now ‘let’s go get your dreams,'” Grieb said, adding that the young man’s dreams are “to live independently, to have his own house, to have his own car.”

Video footage of the event showed the moment the 21-year-old crossed the finish line as people cheered:

“Put your hands together again for the history in the making,” the announcer said.

In an Instagram post Sunday, Chris wrote “Goal set and achieved. Time to set a new and BIGGER Goal for 2021. Whatever it is the strategy is the same. 1% Better every day.”

“YES, I did the work but I had angels helping me. God surrounded me with Angels. Best part of all. New family and friends. All about awareness and inclusion. Awareness for Down Syndrome and Special Olympics,” he continued.

Now, Chris hopes to be invited to compete at the Ironman in Hawaii, according to Fox 35.

“I’ll be doing Kona Hawaii,” he told the outlet."

According to Front Office Sports, “At halftime of the 2020 season, the league is averaging 14.9 million viewers, down 7% from last season.”

One of the league’s bright spots was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Giants game. According to Front Office Sports, with Tom Brady leading them, the Buccaneers racked up a 17 percent jump over last season’s Week 9 game and earned 11.7 million viewers.

Still, there are many worries that the NFL is heading backward in ratings.

“After growing 5% in each of the past two seasons, some TV executives worry the NFL’s 7% drop at the halfway point of 2020 augurs a return to the 2016 and 2017 seasons — when average audiences fell 8% and 10%, respectively,” Front Office Sports wrote.

With politics still riling the nation, Week 8 still saw poor ratings. Thursday Night Football continued the weak ratings seen for nearly every other week this season. The game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Panthers earned only a paltry 8 million viewers.

The numbers show that ratings for every NFL Week thus far, but two have fallen over the league’s ratings for 2019. Of the two, one week was flat in viewership, and the other was slightly up.

According to the numbers: Week 1 earned 16.2 million viewers – down 8% from 17.6 million in 2019; Week 2 saw 14.8 million – down 5% from 15.5 million; Week 3 15.5 million – flat over 2019; Week 4 got 12.7 million – down 26% from 17.2 million; Week 5 saw 14.4 million – down 14% from 16.7 million; Week 6 earned 14.5 million – up 3.6% from 14 million; Week 7 had 14.7 million – down 6.4% from 15.7 million: and Week 8 earned 16.2 million – up 3% from 15.7 million.

TV execs are praying that the league’s ratings will begin to rise now that politics and other sports are out of the NFL’s way.

Notre Dame’s school president, however, is less enthused.

The Irish defeated then-#1 Clemson 47-40 in a double-overtime thriller for the ages on Saturday night. After this, the student charged the field.

Despite the history-making joy of the moment, Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins issued a statement on Sunday expressing how “disappointed” he was with the students’ behavior.

“As exciting as last night’s victory against Clemson was, it was very disappointing to see evidence of widespread disregard of our health protocols at many gatherings over the weekend,” Rev. Jenkins said.

Jenkins did not confine himself to expressions of disappointment, however. He also laid out several new Covid-related steps and restrictions for students that will follow as a result of charging the field.

Jenkins wrote:

1) “Because we are now even more concerned about the potential for contagion in your home communities as you prepare to travel home at the end of the semester, the University will place a registration hold on the record of any student fails to appear for testing when asked to do so. A Registration hold would mean that you are unable to matriculate or register for classes next semester or receive a transcript.”

2) “Furthermore, you may not leave the South Bend area until you receive the results of your exit test. Again, should we discover that you have left the area, we will place a registration hold on your record.”"

Over the weekend, the media declared former Vice President Joe Biden the winner, but the President Donald Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in multiple states over claims of voter fraud.

Host Joe Scarborough said it was a “dangerous path” to contest the results. He added Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “knows this election’s over,” and that is why he is focusing on the Georgia Senate run-offs, which Scarborough said the GOP should win unless Republicans “really foul things up” with fighting the results.

“This is nonsense,” Scarborough said of the alleged fraud. “You don’t have to ask where Mitch McConnell is. Mitch McConnell knows how to count votes. Mitch McConnell knows this election’s over. He’s concerned about winning those two Georgia seats, which he should win unless Republicans really foul things up over the next several weeks — which they could do if they follow the madness of Donald Trump’s claims.”

“It would traitorous, actually, to the process that our country has in place for a peaceful transition, and quite frankly, any of these Republicans who try and do that might find themselves in the wrong location across from an adult bookstore,” Brzezinski advised. “I mean, that actually happened.”

Co-host Mika Brzezinski questioned why Trump is continuing to declare victory on Twitter and fighting the results. Scarborough argued that Trump is “reckless,” and nobody believes him.

“I’m asking the question … what does he see on the other side of this that is having him act so unbelievably erratically against what is so transparent and true?” Brzezinski wondered.

“We’re four years into Donald Trump, and you’re asking what does he think is coming out of this? He’s a day trader,” Scarborough replied. “As Maggie Haberman said, he’s survived trying to live the next 10 minutes. He will figure out at some point it’s over because people around him know it’s over.”

“Well, of course. But I think many would say the more destruction you do now, the more destruction you do to your next act,” Brzezinski stated.

“Nobody believes him. Nobody believes a word he’s saying,” Scarborough added. “What destruction? Nobody believes him. Listen, I think it’s reckless, yes, it’s reckless. He’s a reckless man, but nobody believes him. His family doesn’t believe — I think everybody knows this is over. They just do.”

He added, “But not the way these elections are run.”

Host Joel Pollak highlighted that Trump supporters showed up “70 million strong” for the November 3, 2020, election, then added, “The Republicans turned out supporters, and the Democrats turned out envelopes.”

Hanson responded, “There was massive voter fraud. I believe that. But, nonetheless, this shouldn’t even have been close–the margins in places like Michigan or Wisconsin, even Minnesota or Pennsylvania, given what he had done for the country.”

Hanson observed, “But who did [Trump] have in his corner? Maybe talk radio … maybe Breitbart, maybe half of the Fox team, maybe not. … Hoover Institution was not for him, National Review was against him. Most of the mainstream Republican establishment [was against him]. Big Tech was against him. Wall Street was against him. Big Money, the universities, professional sports, entertainment, everybody was against him, yet he overcame all that, almost.”

He said, “In a fair and just world, people have probably found a way to show support, but now the way these elections are run. When you have, in my district, 85 percent mail-in ballots and only 15 percent are showing up at the polls, and we know what happened in 2018, with massive voter fraud in here in California in the 21st District, it’s something we’ve never seen before. And let’s not even get into the question of a state like Georgia adopting an entirely new computer system, that was subject to malware and problems with glitches, not six months before the election.”

Hanson likened Trump to a hero from classic westerns, who fights valiantly and consistently, wronging rights and calling out bad actors, eventually keeping the fight up longer than the townspeople can endure.

He used the image of the people eventually drawing up into the fetal position, putting their hands over their ears and asking for someone to “make it all go away.”

He explained that this was the people saying, “They don’t care how it goes away they just couldn’t take it anymore. …There were just so many things that Trump fought that people said–wrongly, I think–that ‘I want a break from all this.’ There is a great scene in High Noon when Gary Cooper goes to the townspeople and says, ‘Look, all you need to do is back me, and we can stop these people,’ and they all say, ‘Yes, yes.’ Then they just fade, and he basically says, ‘I’m just going to do it alone, and it’s going to benefit them.'”

Then Cooper throws down his badge and says, “I gotta get out of here.”

Hanson added, “I’m not saying Trump won’t fight this. He’ll fight tooth and nail. But there’s something about him–I think he realizes by now: he was so incredibly successful, and he was such a fighter, and he didn’t care what people thought of him, and he understood that, in a tragic way, we don’t have a place for him in a society like ours. Maybe we will. Maybe he’ll come back, There’s always a western sequel in 2024.”

Bush Congratulates Joe Biden as ‘President-elect’,"Former President George W. Bush on Monday congratulated former Vice President Joe Biden for winning the election, after corporate media outlets declared him the victor.

“Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,” Bush wrote in a statement. “The President-elect reiterated that while he ran as a Democrat, he will govern for all Americans.”

Bush also called Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for her “historic” election as the first elected woman vice president.

The former president also congratulated President Donald Trump’s supporters for a “hard-fought campaign.”

“He earned the votes of more than 70 million Americans – an extraordinary political achievement,” Bush wrote. “They have spoken, and their voices will continue to be heard through elected Republicans at every level of government.”

Bush said that the election was a sign of America’s healthy democracy although he acknowledged Trump’s right to challenge the results.

“President Trump has the right to request recounts and pursue legal challenges, and any unresolved issues will be properly adjudicated,” he wrote.

But at the same time, Bush urged Americans to trust that the election was fair.

“The American people can have confidence that this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear,” he said.

Finally, Bush urged Americans to come together as a nation and promised to pray for America’s leaders during the transition.

“We must come together for the sake of our families and neighbors, and for our nation and its future,” he wrote. “There is no problem that will not yield to the gathered will of a free people.”"

Axios reports that President Trump’s campaign will announce specific recount teams in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, and prepare to rally supporters to their legal challenge.

“We all have the same goal in mind, which is using the legal process over the next many days and weeks ahead to make sure that the president is re-elected,” one adviser told Axios.

The president plans to demonstrate that dead Americans voted in the 2020 election, showing the public images of their obituaries.

A Trump campaign official confirmed the report with Breitbart News.

“These would be grassroots rallies, not presidential rallies,” the official clarified.

The Trump campaign continued sending text messages and emails to supporters throughout the weekend, asking for their financial support to help challenge the results of the election.

The campaign could continue litigating the election into December, despite corporate media outlets on Saturday declaring former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) the winner of the election.

“Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?” Trump asked on Twitter on Sunday. “We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks!”"

Turley, during FNC’s “Fox & Friends,” pointed out the oddity of people claiming there was no fraud taking place as ballots are still being counted. He advised that the United States has had electoral problems in the past, so there should be an investigation — even though he acknowledged it is not likely that anything overturns the election results.

“You know, it was an odd thing to have so many people coming out and saying, look, there is no case to be made here,” Turley stated. “We’re still in the tabulation stage. You know, the information that would reflect a systemic problem or large numbers of balloting errors would come at the next stage, at the canvassing stage. Most of this information is held by election officials. And it often takes a court order to get that information to the opposing party.”

He later added, “The odds dramatically favor Vice President Biden, but what I don’t understand is how so many people want these challenges to end and for there to be just simply a concession. We have had electoral problems in this country. In 1960, the outcome of that election is still believed to have been fraudulent. You know, in Illinois in Texas there were a lot of fraudulent votes that put Kennedy over the top against Richard Nixon. In 2000, people still believe we didn’t take enough time in Florida and that Al Gore may have won Florida and won the presidency. So, there is no reason not to look at the allegations, to give 71 million people who voted for Trump that sense of assurance that nothing untoward occurred and that their votes really did count. Now, can they really overcome these margins? Probably not, but we don’t know what we’re talking about here.”

An overwhelming majority of rank-and-file officers expressed a lack of confidence in Moore, saying that he acted as a “politician” by supporting the protesters and failed to exhibit “strong leadership.” The survey, which was conducted by the L.A. Police Protective League, also found that officer morale continues to plummet, with more than a third of cops thinking of leaving the department.

The results come as the LAPD enacts budgetary cuts across multiple divisions in the wake of the left’s “defund the police” movement. The department will stop responding to traffic collisions, and will downsize its homicide and robbery divisions, following the city’s decision to defund the department to the tune of $150 million.

In the survey, 86.3 percent of respondents said that they don’t feel Moore supports them, with some saying that they lost respect for the department’s top officer when he took a knee in June to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter.

“Many called for the resignation of the chief of police,” the survey said, citing his “cowering to protestors by kneeling” and his failure to defend officers to the media.

The survey found that 89.8 percent of respondents felt that LAPD command staff failed to demonstrate strong leadership during the riots, with many cops saying that leaders acted as “puppets” to local politicians, including Mayor Eric Garcetti (D). Nearly 55 percent of cops said they don’t have the adequate equipment to do their jobs.

Nine out of ten respondents said they would retire from the department if they could, with 38.9 percent of cops saying they are thinking of leaving the LAPD for other agencies.

The overall morale of LAPD officers has sunk to near rock bottom. When asked to rank morale on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest, half of all respondents ranked it at 1.

Moore responded to the survey by saying that he was committed to “doing a better job.”

“First, I mean to expressly acknowledge that I hear you, see you, and am committed to doing a better job as your Chief,” he said in a letter to rank-and-file cops obtained by Breitbart News. “Second, I apologize to those of you who I failed by my actions or words. I believed in my heart each action was the right thing to do. However, there are things that I wish I could go back in time and do over. But life doesn’t work that way.”

While Moore said that the department is responding to complaints by issuing more protective gear, he also warned that cops will have to do their jobs with fewer resources.

“We will reorganize and prioritize what this Department will do to meet budget cutbacks and strive to provide for public safety with a much smaller workforce.”

As Breitbart News reported, the LAPD is expected to see retirements soar in January, which would deal a blow to a department already struggling to maintain the peace and to protect its own officers from attacks. Sources said cops are waiting until the new year to retire because a new contract will pay them 100 percent of their sick time. Prior to that, officers only received 50 percent of sick time.

Ever since Mr. Biden claimed victory on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin has remained silent on the matter and said Monday he is aware that legal proceedings regarding the election results are still pending.

Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow considers it prudent to wait for the official results before commenting on the election.

“We consider it correct to wait for the official results to be finalized. I want to remind you that President Putin repeatedly said he will respect the choice of the American people,” Mr. Peskov said.

“You can see that there are certain legal procedures that have been announced by the current president,” said the Kremlin spokesman.

“That is why the situations are different” as compared with 2016, Peskov added, “and we therefore think it appropriate to wait for an official announcement.”

Currently, some U.S. states are still counting votes, and President Trump has launched legal challenges to the results in several key states.

National Public Radio (NPR) recalled on the night of Nov. 7, 2000, major media outlets, including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press, all declared a win for Al Gore, who was the incumbent vice president and the Democratic nominee for president.

“Viewers around the country would soon see Gore’s face on screen as the projected winner of the presidency. Celebrations began in Democratic headquarters everywhere,” NPR noted in a 2018 service.

It took several weeks to finally sort out the results, which concluded in a victory for George W. Bush.

Hassan Rouhani’s comments mark the highest-level response from Iran to Biden and Kamala Harris gaining office, as predicted by the mainstream media.

“Now, an opportunity has come up for the next U.S. administration to compensate for past mistakes and return to the path of complying with international agreements through respect of international norms,” the state-run IRNA news agency quoted him as saying.

One of Trump’s signature foreign policy moves was withdrawing the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, and introducing punishing economic sanctions in its place.

He described the deal as the “worst, horrible, laughable” piece of foreign policy applied by the U.S. in generations, a product of Barack Obama’s legacy of Middle East appeasement.

The sanctions targeted Iran’s crucial oil industry and cut Tehran’s access to its revenues abroad by blacklisting its banking sector, among others.

“The people of Iran, though their heroic resistance against the imposed economic war, proved that the U.S. maximum pressure policy was doomed to fail,” Rouhani said. He added Iran “considers constructive engagement with the world as a strategy.”

Also Sunday, the Press Associated reported Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted “the world is watching” to see if a possible Biden administration would depart from Trump’s hardline approach toward the Islamic Republic.

“Deeds matter most,” Zarif added.

Iran’s First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri for his part said Iranians “will not forget the pain caused by the widespread disruption of their livelihood, lack of patients’ access to medicine and the assassination of the dear general” Qasem Soleimani.

Soleimani, who headed the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Qods Force, was killed in an American air strike near Baghdad airport in January.

Biden decried that action, saying he would not have moved against the proven Islamist terror leader.

He also famously advised former President Barack Obama not to strike al Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.

Biden, whom the Associated Press declared president-elect on Saturday, has already tasked his transition team with focusing on how to leverage the “executive power” of the Oval Office, according to the Washington Post."

“I look forward to working with President-elect Joe Biden and his administration to strengthen the Palestinian-American relationship and achieve freedom and independence, justice and dignity for our people, as well as work for peace, stability and security for all in our region and the world,” Abbas said in a statement.

Palestinian ambassador to the UK Hussam Zomlot, who previously served as the envoy to Washington until the Trump administration expelled him and shuttered the diplomatic mission in Washington, hailed the “historic & inspiring elections.”

“I sense the excitement of those who aspire to a just and lasting peace in Palestine. Engagement based on mutual respect, freedom, justice and equality must be the way forward,” Zomlot wrote on Twitter.

Biden, whom the Associated Press declared president-elect on Saturday, has already tasked his transition team with focusing on how to leverage the “executive power” of the Oval Office, according to the Washington Post.

PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said Abbas is ready for “immediate engagement” with the U.S. if their terms are met. He later added he hoped the Biden transition team will place the Palestinian cause on “their list of priorities.”

“We look forward to constructive bilateral U.S.-Palestinian relations towards achieving a just and lasting peace within the frame of two states and ending the Israeli occupation,” Shtayyeh said.

“President Mahmoud Abbas is ready for immediate engagement when there is a partner and a serious process with clear terms of reference,” Shtayyeh said.

The Israel Hayom daily quoted an unnamed senior official in Abbas’s office as raising concerns that Biden would be too pro-Israel.

“He is a veteran politician of the Democratic Party and belongs to a wing of the Democratic Party that sees Israel as an asset and not a burden,” the source told the newspaper.

According to the official, Abbas may be one of the first Arab leaders to meet with Biden and will demand that the president-elect immediately revert Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and the subsequent embassy move there.

Close Abbas aide Nabil Shaath said the PA will also demand that the U.S. reopen the diplomatic mission in Washington, as well renew American aid to the Palestinians and to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and their descendants UNRWA, both of which Trump stopped over the Palestinians so-called pay-for-slay scheme paying terrorists and their families.

“There has never been anything worse than the Trump era. Salvation from it is an achievement,” Shaath said.

Senior Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi celebrated what she called a “detrumped” United States.

“Trumpism must be carefully scrutinized & remedied to restore the human, moral & legal equilibrium within and beyond the U.S.. Such phenomena do not emerge from a vacuum,” she said.

“Now is the time for holistic & bold therapeutics,” Ashrawi said in a statement.

“We don’t expect miraculous transformation, but at least we expect the dangerous destructive policies of Trump to totally stop,” Ashrawi, who is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s Executive Committee, went on.

“They should change course and deal with the Palestinian question on the bases of legality, equality and justice and not on the basis of responding to special interests of pro-Israeli lobbies or whatever,” she added.

Last week, apparent vice president-elect Kamala Harris told The Arab American News that under a Joe Biden administration, the U.S. will work to restore ties with the Palestinians which the latter severed under the Trump administration.

Harris said Biden will reopen the Palestinians diplomatic mission in Washington and renew humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians.

She added that Biden was committed to the two-state solution. Biden is also likely to oppose Israeli government steps to apply sovereignty over the West Bank."
226,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/08/researchers-question-reliability-of-dominion-voting-systems-election-systems-software/,"Researchers Question Reliability of Dominion Voting Systems, Election Systems & Software","Researchers have questioned the reliability of new voting machines that state and local officials have rushed to implement at their polling locations ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

“Some of the most popular ballot-marking machines, made by Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, register votes in bar codes that the human eye cannot decipher,” according to a February report by Associated Press.

But according to researchers, that’s a problem, as “voters could end up with printouts that accurately spell out the names of the candidates they picked, but, because of a hack, the bar codes do not reflect those choices.”

“Because the bar codes are what’s tabulated, voters would never know that their ballots benefited another candidate,” the report adds.

State and local officials had reportedly rushed to replace old voting systems with the new software ahead of the 2020 presidential election out of fear of “unreliable electronic voting machines” in the wake of so-called “Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential race.”

But instead of using hand-marked paper ballots — which are most resistant to tampering due to the fact that paper cannot be hacked — many have opted out for technology that computer security experts believe to be nearly as risky as the older electronic systems.

Election Systems & Software disagrees, insisting that the security and accuracy of the company’s ballot-marking machines “have been proven through thousands of hours of testing and tens of thousands of successful elections,” according to a company spokesperson, Katina Granger.

Nonetheless, critics see the machines as vulnerable to hacking and noted that tinkerers at last year’s DefCon hacker convention in Las Vegas were able to “hack two older ballot-marking devices” in less than eight hours.

“There are a huge number of reasons to reject today’s ballot-marking devices — except for limited use as assistive devices for those unable to mark a paper ballot themselves,” said Doug Jones, a University of Iowa computer scientist.

The report added that Jones is one of many experts who believe that today’s ballot-marking machines undermine the concept of keeping a paper record that can be used in audits and recounts.

Several counties in both Michigan and Georgia have reported encountering what election officials described as a “glitch” involving their voting machines during the 2020 presidential election.

Dominion Voting Systems election software was implemented in all of Georgia’s counties for the first time this year.

“Georgia’s new electronic voting system is vulnerable to cyberattacks that could undermine public confidence, create chaos at the polls or even manipulate the results on Election Day,” reported the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) in October.

The report added that computer scientists, voting-rights activists, U.S. intelligence agencies and a federal judge have continuously warned of security deficiencies in Georgia’s system, but state officials have dismissed their concerns.

An investigation by AJC also determined that Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office weakened the system’s defenses by disabling password protections on a key component that controls who is allowed to vote.

The report continued:

Officials tell voters to verify their selections on a paper ballot before feeding it into an optical scanner. But the scanner doesn’t record the text that voters see; rather, it reads an unencrypted quick response, or QR, barcode that is indecipherable to the human eye. Either by tampering with individual voting machines or by infiltrating the state’s central elections server, hackers could systematically alter the barcodes to change votes. Such a manipulation could not be detected without an audit after the election. The new voting system “presents serious security vulnerability and operational issues” caused by “fundamental deficits and exposure,” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg wrote in a recent order, in which she criticized state officials for not taking the problems more seriously. “These risks,” Totenberg wrote, “are neither hypothetical nor remote under the current circumstances.”

The report added that Texas rejected Dominion Voting Systems, saying its inspectors encountered “multiple hardware issues” and could not certify that it was “safe from fraudulent or unauthorized manipulation.”

Dominion disagrees with these findings, stating that multiple large local governments across the country — such Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, and San Francisco and San Diego counties in California — have purchased their system.

U.S. intelligence agencies, however, have warned that such systems can be targets of foreign governments trying to disrupt elections.

The campus is currently reporting a positivity rate of under one percent.

According to a local news report, the University of Connecticut is shutting down its main campus to mitigate the spread of coronavirus on campus. Less than one percent of the UConn population has reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus.

Breitbart News reported in October that students at the State University of New York will be required to test negative for the virus before they are permitted to leave campus for the holiday break. Now, University of Connecticut officials announced this week that they are encouraging students to take a coronavirus test before they travel home for the Thanksgiving holiday.

“Students are welcome to get a test and they should,” UConn Dean of Students Eleanor Daugherty. “Go home and let your family know that you are healthy and safe and ready to be back in the family unit.”

Daugherty said that the decision to shut down the campus was made over concerns that students would bring the virus back to campus with them following the holiday break.

“We know that when people leave and come back they usually bring the virus with them, so by having students go home for Thanksgiving and remain home, we’ll be able to keep them within their own families and not risk spreading the disease to travel,” Daugherty said.

One student interviewed by the local press said that he approved the university’s decision to exercise an abundance of caution.

“All of us going home and staying home for a couple of months is the right move,” one student said. “We will see what happens over winter break. Hopefully, it will die down. I know it’s going back up because of Halloween, and holidays aren’t going to be good either.”

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) ignored social distancing guidelines as they took to the streets to celebrate the mainstream media’s announcement that Joe Biden would be the next president, taking photos and talking with other Biden supporters.

While de Blasio maintained the use of a face mask, he did not maintain a six-foot spatial difference with the hundreds of others who were in the area to celebrate. As seen here, de Blasio and his wife took the time to stop and pose for photographs as he wrapped his arms around supporters.

The photos were shared to social media by the official NYC Mayor’s Office Twitter page.

“Congratulations, President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris,” de Blasio stated in the tweet. “New York City stands ready to work with you to heal our country and set us on a better path.”

The Daily Mail, one of the first outlets to share the news of de Blasio breaking social distancing guidelines, said the “staunch Trump critic was pictured huddling in close with a number of New Yorkers to snap selfies near Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.”

Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, de Blasio has been very strict on residents of the city, forcing them to practice social distancing and wear face masks.

In March, de Blasio warned that residents who refuse to heed the orders of officials and keep their distance from others could face fines. “They’re going to give people every chance to listen, and if anyone doesn’t listen, then they deserve a fine at this point,” de Blasio said at the time.

Also in March, de Blasio failed to follow his own city’s coronavirus guidelines by taking a trip to work out at the Brooklyn YMCA. In October de Blasio pleaded with New Yorkers that they “not travel out of state for the holidays,” claiming it could put the city at risk.

De Blasio also drew immense criticism from residents in the city earlier this year after he and his wife traveled 11 miles from their residence to Brooklyn’s Prospect Park.

New Yorkers were arrested by the dozens in May after they violated social distancing guidelines and visited the city’s beaches and parks.

Schumer, a native of Brooklyn, New York, celebrated the media’s projection of a Biden victory by joining supporters in the streets, where he claimed “we don’t want [Trump] here anymore in New York!”

While Schumer attempted to maintain the use of a face mask as he ignored a six-foot spatial difference between himself and others, he removed the mask to speak to those in attendance.

“Let’s send Donald Trump back to Florida, we don’t want him here anymore in New York,” Schumer claimed.

As previously reported by Breitbart News, Schumer has a long history of supporting the use of face masks in public.

“President Trump can’t even model good behavior and consistently encourage Americans to wear a mask,” Schumer wrote in a July tweet. “Every time he takes the podium, he’s a threat to public health. We are living through one the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our country’s history.”

As thousands of his supporters openly gathered in large cities across the country and violated social-distancing rules to celebrate news of a projected victory, Biden remained silent, calling for unity as he addressed supporters Saturday night.

On Sunday, after the conclusion of several large protests, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) sent out a reminder to her followers on social media to “practice social distancing,” telling them that “COVID-19 is still here.”"

Her reminder comes after videos and photos of thousands of her and former Vice President Joe Biden’s supporters took to the streets to celebrate the media’s declared victory of their campaign in the 2020 presidential election.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) even celebrated in the streets of New York without a mask on:

Despite their supporters gathering together and not adhering to social distancing guidelines, Democrats argued that voting in-person last Tuesday was too big of a health risk with coronavirus.

The establishment media largely refrained from calling them “super spreader” events, as they did President Donald Trump’s rallies, where thousands packed together, many also with masks on.

On Sunday, the Guardian reported that 500 academics have written an open letter to United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson that said the risks of COVID-19 have been exaggerated.

As part of a study conducted by a psychology professor, student participants were analyzed as they interacted with students from different minority backgrounds.

According to a report by Campus Reform, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, claims that he was “surprised” to learn that most students do not treat their minority peers worse than their non-minority peers.

University of Wisconsin, Madison, psychology professor Mark Brauer conducted a study to determine the frequency by which minority students are on the receiving end of offensive comments. To conduct the study, students at the university were examined as they interacted with minority student actors in scenarios devised by Brauer.

“We were surprised by these results,” Brauer said. “We tried out one situation, then another one, and so forth. But study after study came back with the same result: Most students did not treat our white actor more positively than the Black, Asian, or Muslim actors.”

The researchers concluded that as little as five percent of the observed students treated minority students worse than non-minority students. The study cites the Pareto Principle, the idea that 80 percent of consequences come from 20 percent of causes, to suggest that racial incidents are caused by only a small portion of the population.

The results showed that between 5% and 20% of the participants treated the confederates belonging to marginalized groups more negatively than nonmarginalized confederates. Our findings are inconsistent with the dispersed discrimination account but support the concentrated discrimination account. The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Our results suggest that the Pareto principle also applies to discrimination, at least at the large, public university where the studies were conducted.

Breitbart News reported in October that the student government at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, recently voted to remove a “racist” statue of Abraham Lincoln from campus.

Cuellar: Far-Left Messaging ‘Didn’t Play Well in My Congressional District’,"During an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Outnumbered Overtime” on Sunday, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) reacted to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) saying the far-left messaging coming from some within the Democratic Party hurt the party in the 2020 election.

Cuellar agreed with Kasich, saying the left calling to defund the police and attacking the energy sector “didn’t play well” in his congressional district.

“Some of that messaging didn’t play well in my congressional district. Maybe it plays well in some members’ districts, but in my district, it didn’t play well. And I think … the former governor had a point about we just got to make sure that we understand one thing, [which] is America is not far left. America is not far-right. It’s either center-left or center-right, and that’s the way it’s been, and that’s where it’s going to be.”

Host Harris Faulker asked, “[W]hen you say it didn’t play well, give me a specific example. What didn’t play well?”

Cuellar replied, “Defunding the police. Or even attacking the oil and gas. I mean, everybody has their own district. In my area, energy is big here, as you know. Texas is number one in the country on oil and gas, but we’re also number one in wind energy in the country also. So, we have to understand that there are ways that we can balance the energy sector along with a transition. But no transition’s going to happen overnight. I do support the energy sector. I’ve done that for many years. I know the good-paying jobs they have, and I’d rather be dependent on our own energy than to be dependent on the Middle East for energy. I want to produce here locally in the United States.”

Obama said he could not be prouder for Biden and his wife Jill as well as the “groundbreaking” achievement for Sen. Kamala Harris as the first woman and the first black woman to serve as vice president.

Marsha Blackburn has responded to an initiative from far-left Democrats and Never Trump Republicans aiming to target supporters of President Donald Trump by adding them to a list and holding them “accountable” after the election.

Blackburn’s remarks were made in a tweet, which quoted the announcement of the “Trump Accountability Project,” which aims to “make sure anyone who took a paycheck to help Trump undermine America is held responsible for what they did.”

“If by undermining America you mean stopping Democrat socialists, not defunding police and blocking the Green New Deal, add me to your list,” Blackburn wrote, adding the hashtag #MAGA.

The effort, which was kickstarted on Friday, was promoted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY), who wrote in a tweet, “Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? I foresee decent probability of many deleted Tweets, writings, photos in the future.”

“Lol at the ‘party of personal responsibility’ being upset at the idea of being responsible for their behavior over last four years,” she added in another tweet.

The website’s database full of names of Trump supporters includes a list of federal judges appointed by the president.

Jennifer Rubin, a Washington Post columnist and a consistent Never Trumper, said in a tweet that any Republican who challenges the results of the presidential election should be disqualified from holding public office and not welcome in “polite” society.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) in a Saturday tweet.

“President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris usher in a new era,” the post read:

The tweet linked to an article by Charlotte Alter titled “How Joe Biden Won the White House.”

Alter wrote “The only thing more powerful than a dragon is a dragon slayer. For four years, [President] Donald Trump’s penchant for division and chaos was the dominant force in American life.”

“In the end, after a long and excruciating battle, it was vanquished by Joe Biden’s promise of decency, unity and national healing,” she continued.

Although corporate media outlets called the presidential election for Biden over the weekend, Trump questioned their decision on Twitter:

Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be? We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2020

At a press conference in Philadelphia on Saturday, Rudy Giuliani said Trump was “not going to concede when at least 600,000 ballots are in question,” according to Breitbart News.

“It’s not my job to determine if the ballots are right or not; it’s their job. With a mail-in ballot or an absentee ballot, the burden, under law, is on the Party that’s proposing it, which is why it has to be inspected,” he continued.

During an interview Sunday on ABC’s This Week, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) recalled that in 2000 “We gave Al Gore 37 days to run the process before we decided who was going to be president.”

“Why would we not afford the 70.6 million Americans that voted for President Trump the same consideration?” she continued, adding that “If Joe Biden really wants to unify this country, he would wait and make sure that we can prove we had a fair election.”

On Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) urged the president not to concede the election and told his Republican colleagues “we have to fight back, or we will accept our fate.”

“Trump has not lost. Do not concede, Mr. President, fight hard,” he concluded."

Abrams is being lauded by Democrats and the media for her role in turning out the vote for Joe Biden in her state. As noted by the New York Times in May, Abrams played a key role in turning vote-by-mail into a turnout machine for her party:

It was a shocking margin of victory in what was expected to be a close race: an 11-point blowout by a liberal judge over a conservative incumbent for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Now Wisconsin Democrats are working to export their template for success — intense digital outreach and a well-coordinated vote-by-mail operation — to other states in the hope that it will improve the party’s chances in local and statewide elections and in the quest to unseat President Trump in November. … State party officials have spoken regularly with counterparts in other states, addressed a national virtual gathering of union activists and wrote a public memo with Stacey Abrams’s Fair Fight organization detailing lessons learned that can be applied elsewhere.

Last week, Tapper imagined that President Donald Trump would be “physically escorted from the building” if he refused to concede the election.

He did not, however, ask Abrams about her steadfast refusal to concede to her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, as the legitimate governor of Georgia, though she has recognized that he had won in a “legal” sense.

Abrams volunteered to CNN that the party’s infrastructure “may not have yielded a victory for me in 2018,” but did not comment on Trump’s right to seek recounts and legal recourse, not was she asked about it.

Among “these people”: Federalist co-founder Ben Domenech, whom Hayes accused, without evidence, of not caring about coronavirus deaths:

Anyway, remember all these people as the winter continues and we enter the most punishing phase of this. They just don’t care at all. https://t.co/OpuBfS5bdY — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 8, 2020

As Breitbart News reported Saturday:

MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes blamed “thousands” of “just normal Republican staffers” for killing Americans through the coronavirus pandemic, even as Joe Biden called for “unity” in a nationally-televised victory address Saturday evening. Hayes joined the ranks of those on the left calling for retribution against members of the Trump administration, or Trump supporters, for the perceived crime of having worked for, or campaigned for, the 45th President of the United States. He did not explain how he expected to demonstrate criminal culpability for “thousands” of Trump staffers who worked to provide personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, therapeutics, and vaccine trials to save as many Americans as possible. Notably, a disproportionate number of deaths were in Democrat-governed states, and in nursing homes, which several Democratic governors ordered to accept coronavirus patients regardless of the known risks of the virus to elderly residents. As Breitbart News reported Friday, leftists and Never Trump Republicans have begun calling for lists of Trump supporters to be made, so that they could be prosecuted, denied future employment, or forced into social isolation. Joe Biden said Saturday: “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans.”

Hayes is one of several prominent leftists who have vowed political retribution against President Donald Trump’s supporters. They include several staffers for former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, now advising Joe Biden’s transition team.

247,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/08/john-cusack-nearly-third-americans-nazis/,John Cusack: Nearly a Third of Americans Are Nazis,"Far-left Hollywood actor John Cusack fired off a slew of unhinged, anti-Trump tweets in his latest rant, referring to the president and his administration officials, as well as the millions of supporters who voted for him, as Nazis and enemies.

The celebrity actor-turned-radical activist has frequently railed against the Trump administration, but has upped the rhetoric since the recent election.

On Saturday night, Cusack referred to post-election President Trump as a “fascist” being deposed in one tweet and a Nazi in another.

“It’s Just starting to hit – the symbolic power – of replacing a nazi – with a woman of color on the ticket – is massive historic repudiation of trumpism,” Cusack wrote.

It’s Just starting to hit – the symbolic power – of replacing a nazi – with a woman of color on the ticket – is massive historic repudiation of trumpism — John Cusack (@johncusack) November 8, 2020

In another tweet from Saturday, Cusack attacked various members of the Trump administration, referring to Trump legal counsel and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as “Rudy ghouliani,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as “Deathkkult pimp Pompeo,” White House aide Stephen Miller as “Nazi miller,” and Vice President Mike Pence as “Criminal Pense.”

Deathkkult pimp Pompeo

Lawyer the fuck up –

Trump? You will spend the rest of your life trying to stay out of jail felony charges wil be dropped on yr ass – 1st day of yr exile — John Cusack (@johncusack) November 7, 2020

In addition to criticizing Trump and his administration, Cusack went on to refer to all Republicans as a “deathkkkult.”

“If Republicans enable a nazi – that makes them – what – A fucking deathkkkult,” he wrote.

If Republicans enable a nazi – that makes them – what –

A fucking deathkkkult “@markjmeier: @johncusack He didn’t say to reconcile with nazis. Just Republicans.” — John Cusack (@johncusack) November 8, 2020

In one of the more inflammatory tweets, Cusack described thirty percent of Americans as Nazi “enemies,” while condemning Biden’s conciliatory approach.

“I know why Biden is preaching reconciliation But 30 % of country that Are nazi – are enemies,” the tweet read.

I know why Biden is preaching reconciliation

But 30 % of country that

Are nazi – are enemies — John Cusack (@johncusack) November 8, 2020

In July, Cusack joined rioters in embattled Portland in a show of support, while calling federal agents sent to restore order “stormtroopers.”

“Straight up stormtroopers – secret police – fascism,” Cusack said, posting a video of law enforcement officials in the streets. “Storm troopers – Barr’s secret police maybe ice border people – prison guards – who knows – soooo…no prisons or borders in Portland, bill – go to jail.”

Cusack portrayed violence that had gripped the city as part of President Trump’s supposed plan to create mass unrest in a major American city so he could “illegally hold power.”

Cusack himself has been accused of racism after sharing an antisemitic cartoon and quote last year and, after a backlash, even attempting to defend it.

The tweet featured the Star of David atop a hand pushing down on people with a false quote from philosopher Voltaire which read, “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.” Cusack added, “Follow the money.”

Cusack’s inflammatory statements come on the heels of similar messages from other personalities on the left, most notably former Vice President Joe Biden.

In September, Biden compared President Trump to a notorious German Nazi propagandist.

During an interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, Biden was asked how he would combat the president’s repeated claim that he was pushing a socialist agenda.

Trump is “sort of like Goebbels,” Biden said, referring to Joseph Goebbels, the mastermind of Nazi Germany’s propaganda machine. “You say the lie long enough, keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, it becomes common knowledge” among voters.

Rejecting the outrageous comparison, the Trump campaign pointed to the hypocrisy of Democrats painting others as Nazis, having themselves invited anti-Semites to speak at the DNC.

“Rather than launching preposterous accusations against the president, Joe Biden and his team should answer for inviting notorious anti-Semites Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour to speak at the Democrat National Convention,” said Ken Farnaso, the campaign’s deputy national press secretary.

Scarborough said, “Obviously we’re all focusing on who’s going to be the next president of the United States and for good reason. But I have to put a sidebar in here because after the dust settles, if Joe Biden ends up winning the presidency, then I think a lot of people are going to turn to what happened to the Democratic Party.”

He continued, “There is no way to put this other than to say this election was—Joe Biden winning looks like a one-off. This election, for the most part, was an absolute repudiation of the Democratic Party as a brand. Their brand doesn’t work across most of America. It just doesn’t. They got routed in Senate races they should have won.”

He added, “Stop talking about socialism. Stop talking about defunding the police. It doesn’t work.”

Lemon said, “I almost can’t talk right now because of the emotion. I’ve said all along we have two viruses that are infecting this country, and that’s Covid and racism. What we witnessed tonight was the complete opposite of racism with the diversity, with the acknowledgment of all kinds of people, with someone saying they want to represent every kind of American, even the people who didn’t vote for him. We have been starving for that in this country.”

He continued, “I didn’t realize the PTSD that many marginalized people, that African Americans, women, Latinos, people of color, white people — PTSD that people are feeling around this country because we have had whiplash from someone who only cares about himself and not uniting people.”

The article, by Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio, says that stories about Hunter Biden, and the Obama administration’s spying on the Trump campaign, failed to resonate with voters — ignoring the media’s role in suppressing these narratives.

They write:

Trump pushed two factually challenged narratives about Biden in the waning weeks of the campaign. In one, Biden was a mastermind of an effort to spy on Trump’s 2016 campaign, collaborating with top intelligence officials to derail Trump’s incoming administration. In the other, Biden was the secret beneficiary of multi-million-dollar business deals with shady foreign interests carried out by Hunter Biden. But both stories were riddled with falsehoods, exaggerations and assumptions, often pushed by unreliable narrators who revealed no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.

In fact, no one suggested that Biden was a “mastermind,” but Biden has never explained his presence at an Oval Office meeting where the investigation into Michael Flynn was discussed — an investigation that the FBI already knew had no legitimate reason to continue. Biden also was among those Obama administration officials who “unmasked” Flynn’s name in intelligence reports.

As for the Hunter Biden story, there was ample evidence that Joe Biden knew — contrary to his earlier claims — about his son’s dealings, and that Hunter Biden’s position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma posed a conflict of interest. Several Obama administration officials admitted that they had raised the issue themselves.

Cheney and Desiderio claim that Senate investigations into Hunter Biden were a bust — ignoring the fact that the most recent report conclusively established that Joe Biden had been warned that his son’s activities posed a conflict of interest: “In October 2015, senior State Department official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.”

The report also provided details that led Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, to conclude that he had been swindled out of $5 million in Chinese funds that were meant for a joint venture.

Politico‘s Cheny and Desiderio claim: “The storylines appealed almost exclusively to Trump’s diehard political base, and were featured on right-wing websites and the Fox News primetime lineup — a large audience indeed, but a narrow sliver of the wider electorate.”

They also claim that stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop “have not stood up to scrutiny when investigated, and did not conclusively show any corruption.” They do not provide any evidence to substantiate those claims.

Moreover, Politico fails to note that the Hunter Biden storm was actively suppressed by Twitter, Facebook, and the media, with the New York Post suspended from posting anything on Twitter for more than two weeks based on the false claim that materials on the laptop had been “hacked.”

Now, with the election safely distant, Politico calls the story a distraction.

Yet they conclude: “[T]here are lingering questions about the FBI’s pursuit of alleged financial improprieties by the younger Biden that Trump may attempt to air during his last two months in office — or set up landmines for Biden on the matter after he takes office.”

They do not explain why a baseless conspiracy theory that “fizzled” should have such dire consequences.

Cuomo seemed to dismiss Biden’s tack, warning that we could “return to the same place very quickly,” which he indicated could mean another run for President Donald Trump.

Partial transcript as follows:

CUOMO: They are not abusing any tradition or any norm. That is all happening on the other side of the ball as it always has. And as I have reported all along and argued, this is a time where people must be remembered for what they did, what they said, what they did not do, and what they failed to say. Even tonight on our own air, people who were given all these pats on the back in the last couple of days for being a fair broker, even though they come from the right, still explaining away Donald Trump’s position towards our democracy as, “Well, that’s the way he is.”

No, there is good, and there is bad, and there is right, and there is wrong. Not everything is subjective. And just because somebody decides to do what is wrong doesn’t mean it’s a personal style choice. That’s about how you match a tie and a handkerchief, not about how you decide to discuss Muslims or our democracy. And people have to remember how people acted during this time, what they said in the media, in the GOP, and yes, in the Democratic Party as well. And you should never forget how we got here because we can return to the same place very quickly. in fact, Donald Trump could run again.

LEMON: In 2024. This should be an inflection point.

CUOMO: It may be.

LEMON: It could be.

CUOMO: It could be if Biden makes good on what he said. He has to hear the people who didn’t vote for him.

LEMON: But you have to have cooperation with that.

CUOMO: Absolutely, but that takes us to another place. People have power. This election proves that. For all the money, all the special interests, all the media, all the deception, if people come out, they win. The winner of this election without question is the American public because they voted and participated in a way that will work for the winners and the losers. The winners have a mandate and the person they wanted. The losers have the ear of that same person."

According to both Axelrod and Cooper, Biden could serve one term and not run for reelection in 2024. That would open the door for Harris to run for president in 2024.

“She’s obviously got, her profile — I mean her age, you know with Joe Biden’s age, the potential that he may only serve one term,” Cooper said.

“This is unique,” Axelrod said. “This is a unique political situation because never has a vice president entered office on the first day as the, kind of, presumed frontrunner for the nomination four years later. And because of the dynamic that we’ve been discussing here because she is seen by many on the left of the party as sort of their person in the administration, the person who is going to bring different voices into the discussions and so on — there’s also pressure associated with that. So it’s a really unique situation that she’s going to have to navigate.”

The night before, Joe Biden — presumed president-elect the next day — said:

We may be opponents but we’re not enemies, we’re Americans. No matter who you voted for I’m certain of one thing, the vast majority of them, almost 150 million Americans who voted they want to get the vitriol out of our politics. We’re certainly not going to agree on a lot of issues but at least we can agree to be civil with one another. We have to put the anger and the demonization behind us.

Online, there is definitely a backlash growing against the disgraced outlet.

What should worry Fox above all is that they appear to have forever lost their core viewers, the people who were once the most loyal.

You never want to lose your base. Once you lose your base, you’re in serious trouble.

The backlash had been brewing for a while but really took off after Chris Wallace’s dreadful and dreadfully biased and dishonest role as moderator in the first presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden.

The backlash then went nuclear after Fox News maliciously and erroneously called Arizona for Joe Biden on Tuesday night — a state that is still too close to call.

Fox News has stunk for years, but over the past few months it’s gone beyond stinking to out-and-out betrayal of its loyal viewers, especially with its presidential polls that are not simply incorrect, they are bald-faced lies.

If the ratio on the below tweet from Fox’s Special Report anchor Bret Baier is any indication, the backlash is nearing Defcon 1.

Here are some examples. Take a look for yourself.

On Saturday, all Bret Baier tweeted was “Join me + @marthamaccallum tonight 8pmET on @FoxNews,” and the responses were both brutal and hilarious.

My good faith search of the replies shows 100-to-1 negative. They all ran along the lines of…

Uh…no way! @newsmax @SchmittNYC ALL THE WAY! No thanks Nope. That’s a big negative nope – done with Fox! BOYCOTT FOX NEWS! WATCH OAN, NEWSMAX You have lost this loyal viewer! Trying to influence an outcome that is clearly not legitimate! How about no! Done with Fox!! I’d rather get another vasectomy without anesthesia sir Done with fox! You sold out on us! Good luck! Sorry Bret. Fox has jumped the shark. We won’t forget. Yikes the ratio on this. May want to pass that along to Murdoch’s.

The problem, of course, is that in the form of OAN and Newsmax, Fox has legitimate competition now, and that’s just their broadcast competition. Online, Fox has all kinds of competition, including Breitbart News.

Juanita Broaddrick, I believe, speaks for many….

We made Fox what it is…… and they betrayed us. We need a Tucker News Network. — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) November 7, 2020

What’s so awesome about all this is that Fox News is now hated by everyone. The corporate media will always hate Fox, and now Fox has lost its base of support due to its own left-wing bias and a lot of flat-out lying.

But [Stephen Miller’s] also a man. And like all men who commit crimes against humanity, he should be imprisoned by the society he wounded, forever prevented from spreading his pestilence and fear. In a just world, this reckoning would happen right on Jan. 21.

This is just the latest in a growing call from the media and establishment left to criminalize politics, blacklist Trump supporters, and ruin people personally.

On Friday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called for recriminations, not just against White House officials, but against all Trump supporters, when she tweeted, “anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? I foresee decent probability of many deleted Tweets, writings, photos in the future.”

Michael Simon, a self-described member of the Obama administration, agreed and linked to a site called the Trump Accountability Project,” which you can look at here.

Washington Post staffers are also jumping on board. Left-wing Post columnist Jennifer Rubin is calling for anyone associated with the Trump administration to be blacklisted from holding a job and ostrasized from “polite society.”

“Any R[epublican] now promoting rejection of an election or calling to not to follow the will of voters or making baseless allegations of fraud should never serve in office, join a corporate board, find a faculty position or be accepted into ‘polite’ society,” she tweeted, adding, “We have a list.”

“When this nightmare is over, we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” Robert Reich tweeted two weeks ago. “It would erase Trump’s lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe.”

Late last month, the far-left Washington Post sought to clear up misconceptions about truth commissions and concluded that one that held the Trump administration “accountable” would work with “strong, independent leadership, adequate resources and widespread public awareness, commissions — alongside other transitional justice measures — [and] have the potential to help societies publicly acknowledge past injustices.”

Tapper noted the lack of social distancing and suggested those in the streets celebrating Joe Biden’s reported election should wear masks and avoid crowds.

“[L]et’s just take a look outside the White House,” he said. “You see these crowds celebrating. We’ve been seeing images like this from coast to coast all day of people honking their horns and waving flags, people very excited. There they are outside the White House. They are wearing masks, but obviously, they’re not social distancing sufficiently. Again, I hate to be a wet blanket, but we are in the middle of a horrific pandemic that is spreading and getting worse. Please wear masks and avoid crowds as much as possible.”

While leftists celebrate, President Trump, his campaign, and his allies have warned that nothing is settled and that the election is far from over.

“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed,” Trump wrote in a statement following the media declaring Biden the winner, promising that the election is “far from over.”"
260,2020-11-07 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/07/gop-lawmakers-double-down-media-do-not-get-to-determine-who-the-president-is/,GOP Lawmakers: Media Do Not Get to Determine Who the President Is,"Allies of President Trump doubled down after several media outlets declared Joe Biden (D) the victor of the 2020 presidential election, stressing that the media “do not get to determine who the president is” and emphasizing that the election is far from over.

Several media outlets called the race for Biden on Saturday, including CNN, MSNBC, and the Associated Press. Celebrations immediately followed on social media, but a few allies of the president warned that the cries of victory are premature.

“The media do not get to determine who the president is,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said. “The people do. When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is”:

“No matter what the media tells you, this is NOT over. It’s not over until every LEGAL vote is counted. This is America. We the PEOPLE decide who our next President is. NOT the media,” Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) said as the celebration erupted across social media:

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) stressed that the election “isn’t over until all legal votes are counted and certified.”

“There are still serious legal challenges that have been made, and until that process is resolved, the election is not final,” he added:

On Friday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) vowed that Republicans “will not back down from this battle”:

Far from over. Republicans will not back down from this battle. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) November 6, 2020

President Trump has maintained a similar tone.

“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed,” Trump wrote in a statement on Saturday.

“Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media,” he added.

Rudy Giuliani made it clear on Saturday that Trump will not concede when “at least 600,000 ballots are in question.”"

“I’ve tested negative thus far but will be at home quarantining ‘til it’s safe for me to be back at work without putting anyone at risk,” Maddow said in a statement posted to Twitter.

The self-isolation comes as Maddow has been at the center of MSNBC’s 24-hour coverage of the 2020 presidential race.

Maddow said her cohosts Brian Williams, Nicole Wallace, and Joy Reid will be covering the race from the studio.

“Wishing everyone patience and calm; may these remarkable times bring out the best in all of us,” Maddow added in her post.

Immediately after she went off the air, mainstream media movers and shakers wished her well over social media.

“Be well, Rachel Maddow,” tweeted NBC News legal analyst Barbara McQuade. “Thanks for getting us through these past four years.”

That was never the goal. I’ve been waging war against the media for two decades now, and never did I imagine a time where the media would disappear.

Going in, all the way back in aught four (as we rubes put it), I knew only one of two outcomes was possible… Either the media would be shamed into honoring its own mission statement of unbiased, objective coverage with the only goal being to inform the public, or the media would become so exposed and disgraced, it would lose its relevance and people would turn to alternative media for information and truth.

I didn’t get it exactly right. What I didn’t expect was for the media to become so desperate it would shed its phony armor of objectivity and out itself as far-left activists. Which is obviously what’s happened over the last ten or so years, most especially during the Trump Era. But had you told me back in aught four this would happen, I would have been delighted, and I sure am today.

Years and years of trench warfare, writing piece after piece exposing the bias, monitoring four cable networks at a time (I literally had a wall of TVs for years) while scrolling the pages of the New York Times, Washington Post… The work was daunting and at times pedantic, and for a long time, except for a hardy few, I felt all alone and sometimes like I might be crazy; documenting bias after bias, sometimes having to explain it with 1,500 words… And now it’s over. The corporate media have not only come out of the closet, they have discredited themselves, have surrendered their moral authority, and with it the ability to sway public opinion.

New Media had a lot to do with forcing the corporate media to expose itself. If the corporate media wanted to win elections, they really had no choice but to go throw off every pretense of objectivity and go into activist mode. New Media is just that good at what we do, and we are thanks to pioneers like Andrew Breitbart, who not only showed us how it’s done and how to expose the truth, but how to have a blast while doing it. We are the happy warriors wielding truth against media golems.

Sure, the corporate media still pretend to be objective, but that’s just to troll us. They might as well call themselves Batman.

You might argue the media have not lost their influence: for instance, look at what’s happening in the presidential election. Trump could lose.

Yes, Trump could lose, but he got millions more votes than in 2016 (more than Obama!), he made total fools of the pollsters, and despite a five-year jihad to smear him as a sexist and racist, he increased his vote share with women and did better with racial minorities and homosexuals than any Republican in decades.

If Trump loses it will either by the margin of fraud, the margin of his abrasive personality, or the margin of both, because otherwise, Republicans romped on Tuesday night. Despite all the predictions and polls and the full force of corporate media, Big Entertainment, Big Money, and Big Tech, the GOP picked up two statehouses (Alaska and New Hampshire), didn’t lose a single one, and this will be more consequential than usual with redistricting. What’s more, the GOP almost certainly held on to the U.S. Senate and gained seats in the U.S. House.

Oh, and it is still possible the GOP could take the House.

All over the country, woke politics, identity politics, riots, looting, and far-leftism took a drubbing.

Let me put it this way…

The corporate media literally spent billions of corporate dollars, four years, and countless airtime pushing this woke/identity politics bullshit, and it failed so badly that in California — California! — Proposition 16, a ballot measure that would end the state’s ban on affirmative action, went down in flames by 12 points, 56 to 44 percent.

Twelve.

Points.

In California!

The corporate media is so impotent, it could not even convince the most far-left state in the country to embrace affirmative action.

The corporate media are now nothing more than an exclusive cocktail party… It’s a big cocktail party, for sure, and a dangerous one (as I’ll explain below), but what is said at that party has no real effect outside of that party, no real effect on public opinion. And the media know this, which is why people within the media are only interested in trying to please other people in the media.

Everything everyone in the media does now is aimed solely at pleasing the cocktail party, at retaining status, at ensuring the bubble is not popped by reality. Oh, and it’s a sad little bubble, a noisy bubble, a despicable and smug bubble, but a bubble nonetheless — and one so feckless that California rejected identity politics by 12 points, and the 2020 wave was more red than blue, especially down-ticket.

So now we live in a world with two medias…

There’s the corporate media, a straight-up propaganda machine determined to push the country left and willing to do so by any means necessary — including shameless lies, blacklists, smears, violence, and political terrorism; and then there’s those of us in New Media, who are open about our biases while remaining dedicated to truth and transparency and individual liberty.

The fight to expose corporate media bias is over. We won. We forced the villains out of the Objective Closet. That’s a massive victory. Yuge, even!

The fight now is against the corporate media’s blacklisting campaigns. While the corporate media cannot sway public opinion, it can try to silence us, to order Big Tech to assassinate our voice.

Because we tell the truth and have a great time doing so, the corporate media can’t beat us in a fair fight. So now it’s about rigging the game with McCarthyite blacklists — cancel campaigns, boycotts, de-platforming.

The fight’s not over, and the war will never end, but we are in a much, much better place, a much stronger place, a much more energetic place than we were all the way back in aught four.

Anchor Brian Williams said, “When I heard Marco Rubio the day before election day kind of saluting the folks, the Trump caravan that almost ran the Biden bus off the road, you know, you hear something like that from someone who is supposed to be a mainstream Republican Senator, you realize that Trumpism, and that’s part of what the Lincoln Project was formed to defeat, Trumpism is a powerful thing. It may be a loser politically, but do you anticipate it to survive Donald Trump?”

Schmidt said, “Oh, absolutely. Look, we have almost 48% of this country that’s voted for a statist, authoritarian movement with fascistic markers that was hostile to American democracy, to the rule of law that an individual, that’s a cult of personality.”

He continued, “I think that Tucker Carlson is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024. What you are going to see is every Republican candidate will kowtow to the conspiracy that Trump was stabbed in the back by unseen malicious forces of the deep state, that the election was stolen, that it’s illegitimate forever. Forever. More than a majority of the Republican Party will believe this was an illegitimate election because they have been poisoned by the Murdoch operation, by OAN, by Sinclair, by the toxic sludge of sewage and crap and disinformation and lies that flows on Facebook into the screens of the American people. And so this is a long-term fight.”

Prior to the election, some left-wing commentators called for a South Africa-style “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” for Trump supporters.

The human rights forum is a union of 21 rights-based NGOs in Zimbabwe. The Forum’s report cited human rights violations “recorded between April and September this year when the country was under strict Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] lockdown restrictions,” New Zimbabwe noted on Friday.

“The [government’s] promises of a ‘new dispensation’ have disappeared, and the patterns of misgovernance and human rights abuse that characterized Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe’s rule have re-emerged,” the Forum stated in its report. These abuses have worsened since Mugabe left office in 2017, the group asserted, adding that “some of these violations can be characterized as crimes against humanity.”

“Mugabe’s regime saw the slaughter of an estimated 20,000 citizens in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in the early 1980s and Operation Murambatsvina in 2005, among other difficult post-independence periods,” New Zimbabwe recalled.

The newspaper noted that the recent human rights violations in Zimbabwe have occurred “within the context of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus], deepening poverty, and widespread hunger for the majority of Zimbabweans, and massive corruption that is bleeding the country of critical resources needed for the protection of its citizens.”

The Forum condemned what it referred to as “the use of coercion on dissenting voices” in Zimbabwe. “The evident fragility of the country cannot be managed by the resort to coercion and rule by presidential decree,” the human rights group argued in its report.

“Constitutionalism and the rule of law have been replaced by coercion and decree [in Zimbabwe],” according to the Forum.

“Zimbabwe is receiving increased pressure from the international community for reform, even concern from SADC [Southern African Development Community] countries and the African Union, in order to arrest the slide from fragile to failed state [sic],” the group revealed, adding “something must be done with urgency.”

“The call for urgent action by the Forum comes only a day after opposition MDC Alliance deputy national chairperson, Job Sikhala appealed to the United Nations (UN) Security Council to immediately consider military intervention due to the political, economic and humanitarian crisis in the country,” New Zimbabwe reported.

Sikhala made his appeal to the U.N. at a press conference in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, on Thursday. The briefing followed the latest arrest of investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, a dissenting voice in Zimbabwe whom the government has repeatedly suppressed in recent months.

“We call upon the UN in terms of Chapter VII of the UN Charter specifically Article 43 that allows the UN Security Council to pass a resolution concerning those states with a humanitarian crisis,” Sikhala said.

“Ours is a humanitarian crisis. It involves the breach of international crimes such as abductions, torture, crimes against humanity,” he explained.

“The UN must be able to exercise its powers, sit down and pass a resolution that the crisis in Zimbabwe cannot be allowed to escalate the way it is because it is a threat to stability in our country that can spill over into the SADC region,” Sikhala added."

The kidnappers mounted a roadblock and intercepted Cardinal Tumi, who was traveling with his majesty Sehm Mbinglo, a traditional local leader of the Nso people, and abducted both men along with 11 others who were part of their delegation.

The abduction is believed to be the work of a group of Ambazonian rebel fighters headed by a certain “general” Shao Mao (or Chaomao), who intercepted the traveling band as they returned to the English-speaking zone after a short visit to Foumban in western Cameroon.

While Cardinal Tumi, the 90-year-old emeritus archbishop of Douala was released some hours later, Sehm Mbinglo is still being held by the kidnappers.

“Glory be to God. Cardinal Tumi has been freed by the Separatist fighters. He is fine and in good health,” announced Bishop George Nkuo of the diocese of Kumbo on Friday afternoon.

“The Fon of Nso is still being held by his captors,” Bishop Nkuo said. “They were taken in two different directions but the cardinal has been released. We don’t know where the Fon is at the moment.”

During his captivity, Cardinal Tumi was reportedly questioned but not subjected to torture.

The abduction followed on a recent incident in which unidentified gunmen stormed the campus of Mother Francisca International Bilingual Academy in Kumba and fired on the schoolchildren, killing seven and leaving dozens wounded.

“They found the children in class and they opened fire on them,” city sub-prefect Ali Anougou told Reuters regarding the October 24 shooting.

On October 28, Pope Francis condemned the shooting while promising prayers for the victims and their families.

“I participate in the suffering of the families of the young students barbarically killed last Saturday in Kumba, in Cameroon,” the pope said following his weekly general audience in the Vatican.

“I feel great bewilderment at such a cruel and senseless act, which tore the young innocents from life while they were attending lessons at school,” the pontiff added. “May God enlighten hearts, so that similar gestures may never be repeated again and so that the tormented regions of the north-west and south-west of the country may finally find peace!”

“I hope that the weapons will remain silent and that the safety of all and the right of every young person to education and the future can be guaranteed,” Francis concluded. “I express my affection to families, to the city of Kumba and to the whole of Cameroon and I invoke the comfort that only God can give.”

The shooting incident has been attributed to Cameroon’s ongoing “Anglophone crisis” raging in the country’s troubled southwest region.

While no group claimed responsibility for the killings, government authorities laid the blame on the region’s Anglophone separatists, who claim they have been marginalized by the Francophone-dominated government.

Darmanin held talks with Tunisian President Kais Saied and Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine and was due to meet other officials.

Sources close to Darmanin said ahead of the talks that he would submit to authorities a list of some 20 Tunisians who France wants to expel, on the basis that they had been convicted on terrorism charges or were suspected of jihadist inclinations.

The French interior minister is due to visit Algeria on Sunday on a similar mission.

Public opinion in Tunisia is hostile towards the return of suspected jihadists, and authorities have refused the return of their citizens from France on the basis of travel restrictions linked to the coronavirus pandemic.

Tunisian nationals have constituted a significant proportion of foreign jihadists in Syria, Iraq, and Libya over the last decade.

In 2015, the United Nations said that some 5,000 Tunisians had flocked mainly to Syria and Libya to join the Islamic State group (IS), while authorities in Tunis gave a lower figure of 3,000.

Their return has been a cause of concern in Tunisia, which has been under a state of emergency following a string of IS-claimed attacks in 2015 and 2016.

Sources close to Darmanin say that 70 per cent of over 230 foreigners illegally in France and suspected of radicalism are from the Maghreb region, which includes Tunisia and Algeria, and from Russia.

His visit to Tunis was scheduled some time ago but it takes on new urgency following the October 29 killing of three people at a church in the southern French city of Nice.

The alleged perpetrator of that attack, 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui, is not the first Tunisian suspected of carrying out a deadly jihadist attack in Europe.

In 2016, 31-year-old Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd on the Nice seafront, killing 86 people.

Later that year fellow Tunisian citizen Anis Amri, 24, carried out a similar attack at a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people.

The Islamic State group claimed both men as its followers.

It is unclear if Aouissaoui was radicalised at home or after he arrived illegally in Europe in late September.

Ramadan Abedi, who reportedly belonged to the al-Qaeda linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) in the 1990s, was accepted into Britain as a refugee after the North African country former ruler, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, cracked down on Islamic radicals, returning to the country after the regime change intervention spearheaded by Barack Obama and David Cameron toppled him,

Ramadan’s son, Salman, would go on to carry out a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, killing and maiming hundreds of people — many of them children, teenagers, and their parents. Salman’s brother Hashem was also convicted of involvement in the radical Islamic terror attack earlier this year, with a judge ruling he “equally culpable” for it and handing him a “life” sentence with a minimum term of 55 years before he can be considered for parole.

Now the authorities have revealed that the police would like to question Ramadan himself over the attack, as his fingerprints were inside the car which became “a de facto storage facility for the various items of bomb-making equipment” for his sons — but they cannot do so, as he remains in Libya.

The information was revealed by an inquiry into the bombing, which has found a string of failures by the authorities and by security personnel on the night of the attack, who failed to approach Abedi despite being alerted to his strange behaviour because they feared they might be branded racist, despite Greater Manchester Police (GMP) trying to keep it secret.

“I have had to bear in mind the likelihood of Ramadan being available for interview and, if he is, the likelihood of him answering questions,” said inquiry chief Sir John Saunders as he explained why he was deciding to release the information despite claims it might hamper a criminal investigation.

“Five of the six individuals [wanted by police] are out of the jurisdiction, there is no immediate prospect of extraditing them and GMP have indicated to me that the threshold for extradition is not met,” he said.

The other wanted suspects named at the inquiry were Samia Tabbal, the terrorists’ mother, and Mohammed Soliman and Elyas Elmehdi, friends of the brothers accused of acquiring sulphuric acid for them and helping to the explosives-concealings car, respectively.

He was charged with contempt of court for posting on Twitter in defiance of the agreement that saw him released on bail in September.

Chin’ono was arrested in July, a few weeks after he used Twitter to publish an expose on corruption in the Zimbabwean Health Ministry. According to his story, the ministry awarded contracts for some $60 million in coronavirus test kits and protective equipment without proper oversight or competitive contracts.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa fired Health Minister Obadiah Moyo after Chin’ono blew the whistle. Moyo was formally charged with corruption soon after his sacking, along with an executive from one of the companies involved in the alleged scheme. The company in question, a UAE-based firm called Drax International, was linked to Collins Mnangagwa, son of the Zimbabwean president.

Chin’ono was arrested on charges of “inciting public violence” on July 20, along with opposition politician Jacob Ngarivhume. The two were accused of conspiring to launch violent protests against government corruption. Chin’ono livestreamed his arrest, conducted by armed men who smashed in his dining room door and took him into custody without a warrant.

Local and international critics of the Mnangagwa government widely assumed Chin’ono was arrested to shut down his anti-corruption reporting. Chin’ono himself warned “journalism has been criminalized” as he was carted off to prison.

“Instead of detaining those responsible for stealing public funds, President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s security forces would rather employ strong-arm tactics to silence the messenger,” complained Angela Quintal, Africa director for the Committee to Protect Journalists.

“This is a regime that understands that it is incredibly vulnerable. It is not there by popular legitimacy. Hopewell in particular has been at the forefront of exposing that, and Jacob is at the forefront of advocating protests against it. That’s what this is about. This is effectively an insecure regime trying to block the voices of those who want to help citizens understand the connections between corruption and their suffering,” said human rights lawyer Doug Coltart.

Six weeks later, Chin’ono was released on bail. One of the conditions of his release was that he would refrain from posting anything on Twitter. The defiant journalist vowed to keep writing on other platforms and said the government made a “mistake” by arresting him.

Chin’ono was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly violating the terms of his bail agreement by writing a post on Twitter that “impaired the dignity of Zimbabwe’s Chief Justice Luke Malaba,” as the Associated Press put it.

Specifically, Chin’ono accused Malaba of attempting to block his release on bail because the Mnangagwa regime wanted to keep him jailed. Zimbabwean judges wrote an open letter last week complaining they are afraid to hand down any rulings that would displease the government because Malaba interferes in court so frequently.

Chin’ono’s lawyers denounced the contempt of court charges against him as absurd. He could face up to a year in prison if convicted."

Trump is enormously popular in Nigeria, Reuters noted Tuesday.

A Pew Research poll cited by Reuters found him holding a 56-percent approval rating and 58-percent confidence in leadership rating, about double what he typically gets in polls of Europeans.

Trump thanked the Nigerians organizing last week’s parade on Twitter Tuesday.

A parade for me in Nigeria, a great honor! pic.twitter.com/EHiSQMFvSZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2020

The strong Trump support and high poll numbers puzzled Reuters, which recalled reports of Trump referring to African nations as “shithole countries” in a 2018 White House meeting (which Trump denied) and imposing tougher visa limits on Nigeria – along with Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan, and Myanmar – in early 2020. Reuters’ headline described Nigerians as “scored by Trump” but bizarrely determined to “love him all the same.”

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari officially accepted the reasoning behind the visa curbs and appointed a commission to review the security concerns that prompted the U.S. action. Buhari said in August that two of the six concerns advanced by the Trump administration had been “fully resolved,” two had been “substantially satisfied,” and the last two were still difficult works in progress.

None of this history seemed to dim the enthusiastic support for Trump from Nigerians such as Rev. Daddy Hezekiah of Living Christ Mission, Inc., organizers of the October 25 rally in Onitsha. Hezekiah posted a video in which he declared, “President Trump, may we shout for joy over your victory.”

Hezekiah noted that the name “Donald” is a Scottish name whose etymology means “world leader” in a sermon this weekend.

“God had already planned that this man must be great,” Hezekiah said. “So many things are against him – spiritual things, physical things … I was a boy when President Kennedy was shot but I’ve never seen any president who the witches are after as they are against President Trump.”

Another Nigerian, a young artist named Peter Udoakang (or, sometimes, Udoakang Promise Peters), painted a picture of Trump wearing a traditional gold-trimmed red robe as a “mark of respect” for the U.S. president and an effort to “bring him closer to us.”

Still others wished they had a president with Trump’s bold style and unconventional approach to governance, wistfully observing that fewer Nigerians would want to emigrate from their country if it were managed better.

The UK Guardian also took note of Udoakang’s painting of Trump wearing an agbada robe and cap, reporting that portraits of Trump have “grown more common among the impressionist depictions of notable figures often sold from open stalls on the streets of Nigeria.”

The Guardian also found Trump’s support in Nigeria baffling in light of the alleged “shithole countries” comment, plus “widespread accusations of racism and Islamophobia” against the president. Nigerian political analyst Sa’eed Husaini pointed out to the Guardian that Trump’s book The Art of the Deal has long been popular in Nigeria, while a Lagos bookseller confirmed that Trump’s writings constantly sell out, along with the autobiography of his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson.

The Guardian did its best to find Nigerians who do not like Trump – starting with Husaini, who sneered that his countrymen voted for President Buhari, a fellow “septuagenarian economic nationalist with a born-again vice-president, minimal respect for rule of law and archaic views about women” – but they kept tripping over Nigerians who like Trump, citing everything from his style to his conservative policies. Trump’s Nigerian fans were even good sports about his “America First” policies, finding it reasonable that the president of any nation should put his country’s interests first.

“Trump is in many ways a useful avatar for many, embodying what they feel is missing in Nigeria,” the Guardian conceded, after taking a stab at portraying Trump support as a proxy for the anxieties of southern Nigerian Christians about the Muslims who predominantly live in the north.

On that score, Nigeria does have a rather notorious problem with militant Islamists, a problem shared by its neighbors. U.S. special forces on Saturday conducted a daring raid in northern Nigeria to rescue an American citizen kidnapped by militants on the other side of the border in Niger.

“Despite Trump’s strong line against Africa, and anti-Black Lives Matter-protest rhetoric more generally, the Nigerian population still love him and would welcome a second term,” Newsweek fumed, quoting unnamed “economists” who said Nigeria’s economy would be better off under a President Joe Biden because Biden would have open borders and a “less hawkish approach to the oil industry,” by which they meant Biden would make oil more expensive, to the benefit of Nigeria’s petroleum industry.

Newsweek was also surprised that Biden did not seem to gain any benefit in Nigeria from expressing support for the anti-SARS protests, the biggest story in Nigerian politics this fall. The “Special Anti-Robbery Squad” (SARS) was a police unit now disbanded after widespread protests against it for its brutal attacks on civilians, bribery, and other alleged crimes.

“It’s like watching an action movie, or the best reality show Nigerians have ever seen – expressions of wonderment and wild laughter can be heard when people gather to discuss him,” Nigerian journalist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani told Newsweek of Trump’s support.

“Some think that Trump has used very hard words on Nigeria and Africa but are they not true?” asked Anglican vicar Emeka Ezeji. “In African nations, the leaders are selfish, corrupt and presidents who want to remain in power till they die with nothing to show for it. If they had transformed the African nations, I don’t think the president of any country will refer to African countries in a derogatory manner.”

Newsweek concluded by recalling something else President Trump said about Nigeria, something forgotten by most of the American media outlets obsessed with the “shithole countries” imbroglio but perhaps remembered by many Nigerians: when President Buhari visited the White House in April 2018, Trump remarked that Nigeria is “the largest democracy in Africa” and an “amazing country” he would like to visit someday.

“In certain ways, I hear from the standpoint of the beauty of a country, there’s no country more beautiful,” he said."

U.S. special forces rescued Philipe Walton, 27, on October 31 in an operation in northern Nigeria after he was abducted by armed kidnappers on October 27 from his home in neighboring Niger, Reuters reported. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed the operation in a statement released on Saturday: “This American citizen is safe and is now in the care of the U.S. Department of State. No U.S. military personnel were injured during the operation.”

In its statement on Sunday, the PDP “described the situation where the U.S. forces had to embark on a rescue mission in Nigeria, as an international embarrassment,” Nigeria’s Daily Trust newspaper reported.

“Moreover, the fact that under President Muhammadu Buhari, bandits and abductors from neighboring countries now freely cross into our nation to use our soil as detention camps further shows the failure of his administration to secure our national borders and territorial integrity,” the opposition party said.

“It also shows that contrary to claims by the Buhari administration, parts of our country are still under the control of bandits and insurgents,” the PDP added.

“It is indeed grossly disconcerting that under our Commander-in-Chief, a general, who had consistently promised to lead from the front, it took a foreign country to come on our soil to rescue their citizen, while hordes of our citizens are reportedly being held, tortured and killed in various kidnappers’ and insurgents’ dens in various parts of our nation,” the party further said.

“Walton, who kept camels, sheep, and poultry and grew mangoes near the border with Nigeria, was kidnapped by six men armed with assault rifles who arrived on motorcycles at his home in southern Niger’s Massalata village early on Tuesday. … The perpetrators demanded money and searched the home before leaving with Walton,” the Associated Press reported on Saturday.

Most of West Africa’s Sahel region, including northern Nigeria and Niger, has battled a worsening security crisis in recent years; terrorist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State have increasingly carried out attacks across the Sahel, targeting both military personnel and civilians.

The attacks persist despite security assistance from the U.S. and France. The Islamic State terror group killed four U.S. soldiers in an ambush attack in Niger in 2017."

American citizen, Philip Walton, 27, was kidnapped for ransom from his back yard in Niger last week, according to ABC News.

Reuters reported that six gunmen on motorbikes with AK-47s seized Walton and left his family and brother tied up in their home.

The daring SEAL Team operation was conducted in the early morning hours of October 31. The team killed all but one of the seven captors, ABC News stated. No military personnel was wounded, according to a statement from the Pentagon.

“This American citizen is safe and is now in the care of the U.S. Department of State,” Pentagon chief spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said. “No U.S military personnel were injured during the operation.”

President Donald Trump previewed the news on Saturday.

“Big win for our very elite U.S. Special Forces today,” he wrote on Twitter. “Details to follow!”"
276,2020-10-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/10/30/china-lobbies-west-pay-africas-debts-china/,China Lobbies for the West to Pay Africa’s Debts (to China),"Chinese state media on Thursday called on the Western world to help African nations pay their enormous debts, many of which just happen to be owed to Chinese banks thanks to China’s debt-trap Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

China’s state-run Global Times cited Zambia’s inability to make loan payments to the China Development Bank (CDB) as a warning bell for African financial collapse unless the Western world forgets about its own economic difficulties from the Chinese coronavirus, shakes off its “protectionism and populism,” and starts forgiving African debt.

The editorial chided American and European officials for worrying that if they pump more money into Africa, it will just end up in Chinese banks:

For Western countries, the pandemic has led to shrinking funds and capabilities for foreign aid. The impact of the pandemic this year has hit global trade and investment with unprecedented speed and scale, exposing the fragility of modern supply chains. Unemployment rates in developed countries are rising, and income inequality is also increasing. In response to the ever-increasing problems, politicians often do not confront the problem directly and seek solutions, but adopt a nationalist approach, divert public anger, cut foreign aid funds, and concentrate resources on domestic priorities at the expense of support for the less developed countries. The most serious consequence of the rise of protectionism and populism in developed countries is its destruction to the existing multilateral system. Reflected in the field of international aid, mistrust among creditors has further increased. While China is actively promoting the implementation of the G20 “debt relief initiative,” Western countries are beginning to worry that their debt forgiveness to African countries will be used to repay Chinese loans. Although this worry is absurd, it directly reflects how bleak the prospects for international coordination in the future are.

Zambia may yet become the first African nation to default on its debts. The Zambian government announced it would suspend payments to external commercial creditors on October 13, citing cash-flow problems exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. A deal was struck this week to defer a final decision until November 13.

The reason Chinese state media is so agitated about the situation is that Zambia’s bondholders said they want to know more about the money Zambia owes to China before they decide how to proceed.

Patrick Curran, senior economist at the Tellimber consulting firm, told CNBC on Monday that Zambia’s huge budget deficit since 2015 was “driven mainly by a massive pipeline of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects,” exacerbated by the “excessively lax fiscal policy” of President Edgar Lungu.

Curran warned that Lungu’s administration has “squandered” its credibility with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and commercial creditors, especially since it will not come clean about how much money it owes to China, or how those debts are structured.

“The informational asymmetry between creditors — with Eurobond holders in the dark surrounding the extent of indebtedness to China, including the structure and negotiations progress with Beijing — remains a sticky point,” explained NKC African Economics senior financial economist Irmgard Erasmus.

Curran bluntly issued precisely the warning that China’s Global Times urged creditors to ignore — that any savings Zambia realizes from restructuring its European debt will “simply be funneled to Chinese creditors.”

He also pointed out that Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Nigeria have also gone deeply into debt with China to finance infrastructure projects, giving China leverage to control their governments and influence state financial decisions by offering or withholding debt relief.

China Africa Project co-founder Eric Olander warned on Thursday that secretive Chinese debts will make other government and private lenders even more reluctant to invest in African nations, loan them money, or restructure their debts. Properly assessing financial risk is impossible when African governments refuse to be completely transparent about their debts to China, so other investors and lenders are likely to assume the worst, increasing the “risk premiums” for African borrowers.

“Without access to capital, the liquidity crisis in Africa worsens, contributing to inflation that pushes up prices and eats away at what’s left of consumers’ disposable income,” Olander said.

China aggressively pushed expensive Belt and Road projects on Zambia throughout Lungu’s presidency, claiming they would provide fantastic benefits to the Zambian people and dismissing concerns about mounting debt.

Warnings about China’s “debt trap diplomacy,” the tendency of Chinese firms to muscle local competitors out of Belt and Road contracts, and the loss of vital state assets to satisfy Chinese creditors were largely ignored."
277,2020-10-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/10/30/zimbabwe-women-forced-turn-prostitution-lockdowns-batter-failing-economy/,Zimbabwe: Women Forced to Turn to Prostitution Under Lockdowns,"Increasing numbers of women in Zimbabwe are being forced to turn to sex work and prostitution to stay afloat, a report revealed Thursday, as the impact of lockdowns triggered by the Chinese coronavirus batter the socialist country’s already failing economy.

Reuters detailed how thousands of women who lost their jobs when lockdown measures were imposed this year are now selling sex so they can continue to provide for themselves and their families.

One of those women, 24-year-old single mother Esther Kamupunga, told the agency that she was forced into the sex industry after losing her job as a waitress in March.

“Life was better until the advent of this coronavirus. Our business came to a standstill due to lockdown … unfortunately I was one of the people who were retrenched,” she said. “I have two children. I could not watch them going to bed without eating anything. I had no option but to follow some friends to this shopping center.”

Kamupunga typically charges clients $2 USD for a short session out in the open, in places such as a public park, although she often ends up settling for just half that. Those clients who want her services for the night must pay around $10 USD.

“We lie on a cloth spread on top of the grass,” she explained. “It provides comfort suitable for a short time.”

Other women, such as Hazel Zemura, have sold sex for decades to earn a better standard of living in the southern African country, which has long been beset by dire economic conditions as a result of the leadership of socialist dictator Robert Mugabe and his successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

“Hunger drives us into the sex trade,” explained Zemura, who also works with the Women Against All Forms of Discrimination, which provides health programs for sex workers. “As our incomes, like the cross border trading — the importation of weaves and makeup kits from China for resale — got eroded during the lockdown, we had to turn to men for survival.”

As an authoritarian police state, Zimbabwe has imposed one of the world’s strictest lockdown regimes, with reports of mass arrests and officials demanding bribes to let people free. Health officials have recorded a relatively low number of cases — around 8,300 infections and 250 deaths — compared to other neighboring states, but this figure is likely to be higher due to a widespread lack of testing.

The strict measures have damaged the country’s already struggling economy, which before the pandemic had an unemployment rate of at least 16 percent and crippling hyperinflation, with prices for basic goods rising on a daily basis. Sex workers saw their income significantly diminished after the government forced the closure of brothels. Many have also been unable to access condoms due to the closure of the health clinics they depend on.

The rise in sex work is one of the many unfortunate consequences of Zimbabwe’s current predicament. In July, the South African NGO Gender Links revealed that the country has seen a boom in child marriage and general sexual exploitation since the pandemic began.

278,2020-10-29 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/10/29/president-buhari-nigerias-economy-too-fragile-to-bear-another-lockdown/,Buhari: Nigeria's Economy 'Too Fragile to Bear' Another Lockdown,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari warned Nigerians on Wednesday that the country’s economy is “too fragile to bear another round of lockdown” should a second wave of coronavirus sweep the nation.

Buhari made the admission on Wednesday in a statement released through his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, to commemorate the birthday of Muhammad, a designated public holiday in the country. Nigeria is about 50 percent Muslim. An estimated 90 million Islamic faithful reside in the country, constituting the fifth-highest Muslim population in the world.

“Looking at the trends in the other countries, we must do all we can to avert the second wave of the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic. We must make sure that our cases, which have gone down, do not rise again. Our economy is too fragile to bear another round of lockdown,” the statement read, according to Nigeria’s Daily Trust on Wednesday.

Buhari advised all Nigerian citizens to continue observing coronavirus protocols mandated by the state, including social distancing, wearing sanitary masks, and frequent handwashing.

As Africa’s largest oil producer, Nigeria and its economy rely almost exclusively upon the commodity. The oil sector has suffered from declining oil prices during the pandemic, largely due to governments in countries around the world enforcing lockdowns, which disrupt global supply and demand chains and decrease trade and shipping.

As Buhari admitted on Wednesday, the declining oil prices have severely crippled Nigeria’s economy, which is Africa’s largest. Oil accounts for less than ten percent of Nigeria’s GDP, but amounts to over 90 percent of the nation’s foreign exchange; the commodity provides over 60 percent of Nigeria’s government revenue, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

The World Bank in mid-September published a study of the coronavirus pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts on Nigeria over the past several months.

According to a survey conducted between April 20 and May 11, the World Bank found that “42 percent of overall job loss could be traced directly to COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], with a higher percentage of lost employment among the poorest (49 percent) and urban (48 percent) households, relative to the wealthiest (39 percent) and rural households (38 percent). The commerce, service, and agricultural sectors were hit hardest by the spread of the virus.”

Although the overall share of respondents who said they were working had recovered by July, the report said there was some evidence at the time “of people moving in and out of work. Only 34 percent of respondents have been working continuously since mid-March, while 66 percent have experienced some period of time out of work.”

“The most widely experienced shocks in the country continue to be increases in the prices of both major food items consumed (affecting 90 percent of households) and farming/business inputs (affecting 64 percnet of households). Distressingly, the share of households experiencing these two shocks has increased since April/May,” the World Bank reported.

“As of July, many households were resorting to coping mechanisms that can have further longer-term negative impacts, such as reducing food consumption (69 percent of households who experienced shocks) and drawing down their savings (29 percent of households who experienced shocks),” according to the study."

The head of Egypt’s influential al-Azhar religious school called on the international community to criminalize “anti-Muslim” speech.

Sisi said he was not endorsing violence or terrorism, such as the October 16 beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty by a teenage Chechen Muslim after Paty showed cartoons of Mohammed to his students. The murder shocked France and prompted widespread acts of defiance against Islamism, including prominent displays of the Mohammed cartoons.

Sisi nevertheless argued that Muslims have a right not to be offended that should take priority over Western rights of free expression.

“We also have rights. We have the right for our feelings not to be hurt and for our values not to be hurt. And if some have the freedom to express what is in their thoughts I imagine that this stops when it comes to offending the feelings of more than 1.5 billion people,” Sisi said at a commemoration of Mohammed’s birthday, a holiday called Mawlid celebrated by Sunni Muslims on October 29 this year. (Shiites and some other sects of Islam believe Mohammed was born on a different day).

Sisi also insisted that “tolerance is the essence” of Islam.

“Unfortunately, there are extremists from all religions who seek to enhance the spirit of strife and ignite anger and hatred,” he added.

Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Egypt’s thousand-year-old al-Azhar mosque and religious school, called on the international community to criminalize “anti-Muslim” speech and actions on Wednesday.

“Offending Islam and Muslims has become a tool to mobilise votes. The offensive cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) [constitute] blatant hostility against this noble religion and its Prophet,” al-Tayeb charged, as quoted by Gulf News. PBUH is short for “peace be upon him,” a ritual declaration used by Muslims when referring to Mohammed.

“These offensive cartoons adopted by some newspapers and some policies, constitute a violation of all international and legal norms and open hostility towards Islam and Muslims,” he declared.

“Muslims must adhere to peaceful, legal and rational methods in resisting hate speech and obtaining their legitimate rights, following the example of their noble Prophet Mohammed, may God bless him and grant him peace,” al-Tayeb said.

Sisi and al-Tayeb would seem to be on shaky logical ground by praising Islam as tolerant at the same time they list forms of free expression it will not tolerate and demanding restrictions on the free speech of non-Muslims, but the constricted vision of free expression they articulated is not without advocates in America and Europe.

President Barack Obama’s notorious “the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam” speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 had some overlap with the remarks this week.

Obama said there is “no speech that justifies mindless violence” and “no words that excuse the killing of innocents,” but he also envisioned a broad definition of hate speech that would include “slander” against Mohammed, along with “the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.”

In the years since Obama gave that speech, a substantial number of Americans have come to agree with the notion that “hate speech” should not be protected by the First Amendment as free speech. Others who are uneasy with the Constitutional implications of the government banning “hate speech” have grown comfortable with monopolistic tech companies unilaterally imposing speech codes.

Freedom of speech is diminishing around the world, a process greatly accelerated by the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. It is not wildly unrealistic for Sisi and al-Tayeb to expect seats at the table for Muslim leaders when the latest versions of the West’s speech codes are written.

The rising hegemonic power whose ideology of speech control is rapidly becoming dominant across the Internet is not at all worried about offending Muslims, Christians, or any other religion."

“I participate in the suffering of the families of the young students barbarically killed last Saturday in Kumba, in Cameroon,” the pope said Wednesday following his weekly general audience in the Vatican.

“I feel great bewilderment at such a cruel and senseless act, which tore the young innocents from life while they were attending lessons at school,” the pontiff added. “May God enlighten hearts, so that similar gestures may never be repeated again and so that the tormented regions of the north-west and south-west of the country may finally find peace!”

“I hope that the weapons will remain silent and that the safety of all and the right of every young person to education and the future can be guaranteed,” Francis concluded. “I express my affection to families, to the city of Kumba and to the whole of Cameroon and I invoke the comfort that only God can give.”

The pope’s appeal came in response to a shooting incident attributed to Cameroon’s ongoing “Anglophone crisis” raging in the country’s troubled southwest region.

On October 24, unidentified gunmen stormed the campus of Mother Francisca International Bilingual Academy in Kumba and opened fire on the schoolchildren who were on average under 14 years old.

“They found the children in class and they opened fire on them,” city sub-prefect Ali Anougou told Reuters.

While no group has claimed responsibility for the killings, government authorities have laid the blame on and the region’s Anglophone separatists, who claim they have been marginalized by the Francophone-dominated government.

Minister of State at Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Health Adeleke Olorinmibe Mamora spoke at a press briefing organized by the presidential coronavirus taskforce in Abuja on Thursday. Mamora said some of the looted vaccine candidates “could still be useful if they are returned immediately without damage,” according to local newspaper This Day.

“I want to use this opportunity to appeal to our youths to stop crushing our medical supply stores. Most of these drugs are kept under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Destruction of these conditions will render them ineffective and in some cases poisonous,” Mamora explained.

Nigeria Centre for Disease Control’s (NCDC) medical warehouse in Abuja is stocked with medical and laboratory equipment necessary to treat patients with coronavirus, the health minister said. The destruction of items looted from the warehouse “will impart negatively to the country’s response to the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” Mamora warned.

This Day did not clarify which coronavirus vaccine candidate the NCDC referred to.

“The U.N.’s health agency, the World Health Organization [W.H.O.], has said Africa should receive at least 220 million doses [of a future coronavirus vaccine] through an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine known as COVAX,” the Associated Press reported in late September. The W.H.O. confirmed in late August that Nigeria would join “the 92 economies that will be supported [by] the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).” The AMC’s goal is to bring the pandemic “under control via equitable access to COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccines.”

Looters in Abuja targeted a separate coronavirus supply warehouse on Monday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). The warehouse contained food intended for poor families affected by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

“Residents of the federal capital looted a warehouse of Cacovid, a private fund to fight against Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] that finances a food bank,” according to the report. “On foot or by motorbike, hundreds of residents crossed the city loaded with boxes of food” in the wake of the looting.

“We are hungry, you must understand,” one of the looters explained to AFP.

“There is plenty of food in this country, but its people are suffering. The government is kidding us by leaving this food in warehouses,” he added. Nigeria has the highest number of people in the world living below the extreme poverty line.

Several Nigerian governors released a press statement addressing the food bank’s looting. They explained that the food aid had not yet been distributed because “we have chosen to keep strategic reserves in anticipation of a second wave of coronavirus.”

Outside of Abuja, several cities across the nation have reported massive looting in recent days, including Lagos, the economic capital; Jos in central Nigeria; and Port Harcourt in the country’s southwest.

The surge in looting follows weeks of anti-police protests across Nigeria. The demonstrations started as a call to disband a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) following allegations of its abuse of power. Despite the government’s dissolution of the unit on October 11, the protests continued and have since devolved into rioting and looting across major cities."
282,2020-10-25 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/10/25/nigerian-muslims-christian-clerics-have-made-protests-islamophobic/,Nigerian Muslims: ‘Christian Clerics’ Have Made Protests Islamophobic,"A leading Islamic law group in Nigeria accused the country’s Christian clerics on Friday of stoking religious tensions to turn anti-police protests nationwide into forces of anti-Muslim violence, Nigeria’s Premium Times reported on Friday.

The Supreme Council for Sharia’ah in Nigeria (SCSN) alleged on Friday that ongoing anti-police protests in the country’s most populous city, Lagos, and across the nation have shifted in recent days “from ‘a patriotic undertaking into a religious and regional conflict’ due to ‘unguarded utterances’ of some Christian clerics.”

SCSN, a group promoting sharia, or Islamic law, in Nigeria, did not specify which Christian clerics exactly had made “utterances” against Nigerian Muslims. “The group said Muslims and their property came under attack by violent mobs in the wake of the #EndSARS protests due to the alleged inciting comments,” according to the report.

“#EndSARS” refers to the nationwide protest movement to end SARS – the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian federal police – which has overtaken major cities across Nigeria in recent weeks. The government responded to the protests against the unit’s alleged abuses by disbanding SARS on October 11, but the anti-police demonstrations have continued and devolved into violent rioting in several cities, according to the report.

“It is unfortunate and disheartening that some individuals, including notable Christian clerics, rather than cautioning their followers and help contain the escalating violence, they instead aggravated it through their unguarded utterances [sic],” SCSN spokesman Muhammad Bin-Uthman said at a press conference.

“We strongly believe that those utterances, sometimes from the pulpit, helped in turning what was presented as a patriotic undertaking into a religious and regional conflict as we are witnessing now,” he added.

“In Lagos, prominent Muslims were attacked and their businesses torched. The Oba [local Islamic leader] of Lagos had to be rescued out of his palace and the building looted and razed down. It is not difficult to see the motives of the mob,” the spokesman claimed.

Outside of Lagos, “There were attacks on Muslim businesses in Jos, the Plateau State capital, including a branch of Jaiz Bank Plc, an Islamic bank. In Kano, many shops were looted and razed, including a newly opened Galaxy Mall on Igbo Road,” Bin-Uthman added.

“Contrary to the narrative of the group [SCSN], however, angry mobs and thugs attacked police officers, other citizens as well public and private properties irrespective of the religion or ethnicity of the victims,” the Premium Times noted on Friday.

“Nigeria … has the sixth-largest Christian population in the world (87 million), [and] also has the world’s fifth-largest Muslim population (90 million),” Pew Research Center reported in April 2019. Most of the Muslim population is concentrated in the north and the Christians in the South, though many live side by side in the heart of the country. Nigeria is also divided by several ethnic groups, including the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, and Fulani.

“Christians and Muslims reside in approximately equal numbers in the central region and southwestern states, including Lagos, where the Yoruba ethnic group, whose members include both Muslims and Christians, predominates,” the U.S. State Department noted in 2018.

Foreign Policy warned in 2017 that Nigeria’s booming population, high unemployment, and competing religious factions had combined to form a “demographic timebomb,” predicting a future increase in violent crime and ethnic and religious tensions.

Statistics at the time indicated that “a large percentage of Nigeria’s rapidly expanding population will have few or none of the skills needed to secure decent-paying jobs … or otherwise contribute to … [the] economy. Many are likely to join the already 30-million-strong army of unemployed youths aged 15 to 34,” the magazine predicted.

“According to … [Nigeria’s] National Bureau of Statistics [in 2017], more than 45 percent of the country’s 69 million youths are either unemployed or underemployed” the publication noted, adding that this was “a conservative estimate.”

“With such grim employment statistics, it’s little wonder that violent crime, including kidnappings and armed robberies, is on the rise while ethnic tensions, never far from the surface in Nigeria, are growing,” Foreign Policy concluded."
283,2020-10-23 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/10/23/nigerian-president-responds-movement-police-corruption-stop-protesting/,Nigerian President Responds to Movement Against Police: Stop Protesting,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari urged citizens in remarks Thursday to “discontinue the street protests” that have engulfed the country in the last two weeks, triggered by police corruption and abuse.

Protesters began taking the streets of the country’s south in mid-October to demand the dismantling of the nation’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a police unit designed to target larceny and violence. Since its establishment in 1992, human rights groups have documented extensive evidence that SARS officers used their positions to commit atrocities against Nigerians, including regularly extorting bribes from people, torturing and killing subjects, and using their power to kidnap and rob civilians — the crime their unit was built to fight. The latest uproar followed the publication of videos on social media allegedly showing SARS agents executing civilians.

Buhari’s administration announced on October 11 that it would officially dismantle SARS, but the concession did little to stop the protests. SARS officials are eligible to return to the streets as members of other police units.

On the eve of Buhari’s speech Thursday, the first directly addressing police violence against protesters, the nation’s military was facing global reprimand for allegedly opening fire on unarmed protesters in southern Lagos, a key economic hub. Amnesty International has documented at least 56 people killed in the protests so far. He did not condemn state violence against protesters.

The Nigerian military has denied that it has committed any abuses. The only soldier the Nigerian Army has reported punishing was a lance corporal who posted a video to social media urging his fellow soldiers not to shoot at protesters.

Buhari — a former dictator who won the presidency on an unfulfilled campaign promise to eradicate Boko Haram in 2015 in the first peaceful transfer of power in national history — used his statement instead to lament violence from protesters and gangs of criminals who have used the chaos to loot businesses and destroy property. He also accused protesters of being driven by false information.

“I call on all Nigerians to go about their normal businesses, and enjoin security agencies to protect lives and properties of all law abiding citizens without doing harm to those they are meant to protect,” Buhari said, according to Nigeria’s Premium Times. “Let me pay tribute to officers of the Nigeria Police Force who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.”

“The result of this [the protests] is clear to all observers:” Buhari listed, “human lives have been lost; acts of sexual violence have been reported; two major correctional facilities were attacked and convicts freed; public and private properties completely destroyed or vandalised; the sanctity of the Palace of a Peace Maker, the Oba of Lagos has been violated.”

“The spreading of deliberate falsehood and misinformation through the social media in particular, that this government is oblivious to the pains and plight of its citizens, is a ploy to mislead the unwary within and outside Nigeria into unfair judgement and disruptive behaviour,” he added.

Buhari’s remark on the “unwary … outside Nigeria” appears to be a response to global demands on his regime to stop attacking protesters from a growing list of foreign politicians and celebrities. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement Thursday demanding Buhari order an end to state violence against peaceful protesters.

“I therefore call on our youths to discontinue the street protests and constructively engage government in finding solutions. Your voice has been heard loud and clear and we are responding,” Buhari concluded.

On Friday, Buhari held an online meeting with every living former leader of Nigeria to explain his handling of the crisis, claiming that bad actors had “hijacked” the movement.

“We accepted all the demands and proceeded immediately to scrap SARS and started the process of addressing the other demands,” Buhari claimed. ”Unfortunately, the protesters refused to call off the protest and engage the Government to address their grievances. Instead, they became emboldened and gradually turned violent.”

One of the measures Buhari said he took as a concession to the protesters was to raise the salaries of police officers.

Buhari’s speech triggered criticism from his political opponents in Congress, who noted that Buhari failed to address the most recent and concerning act of state violence: agents opening fire on unarmed protesters in Lagos. The minority caucus of Congress noted that the shooting was “the very development that sparked off violent restiveness across the nation and consequent widespread demand for a presidential address.”

“Indeed, the expectation across Nigeria was for Mr. President to reassure Nigerians, especially the youths, by forcefully condemning the killing and brutalisation of our young ones, announcing an accelerated independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the gruesome acts and setting a clear pathway for the much-needed overhaul of our security system,” Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu said in a statement.

Police in Lagos, where much of the violence has occurred, urged citizens to stay home and not join the protests as they attempted to deal with what appeared to be a wave of apolitical violence, surging as criminals take advantage of the police being distracted by assemblies.

Criminals have attacked houses of worship, looted stores, and recently engaged in inter-ethnic violence.

“Police officers are currently patrolling major parts of the city to ensure the safety of residents. Please stay indoors,” Lagos State Police Command urged on Friday, according to Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper.

In parts of Lagos state, violence erupted on Friday with reportedly no authorities around. One incident that reportedly caused extreme panic among locals was a brawl erupting between a group of ethnic Yoruba locals and travelers from the Hausa community. Vanguard reported:

According to an eyewitness, trouble started when a horde of hoodlums intercepted a truckload of cows from the northern part into Lagos in transit to Agege Lairage […] The truckload of cows, however, ran into the roadblock which the occupants, mainly Hausas resisted. The situation subsequently, degenerated into a bloody clash as various dangerous weapons were freely used, throwing the entire area into chaos as other Hausa origins were called in to rescue their colleagues. “Apparently, overwhelmed, the police kept away from the scene for fear of being attacked as well.”

The Hausa people are a majority-Muslim group most commonly found in northern Nigeria. The Yoruba are native to southwestern Nigeria and are religiously diverse, including many following the traditional pagan Yoruba religion also common in Nigerian diaspora communities in the Caribbean.

“Now it is as if [Chinese coronavirus] is no longer there, the public is not taking care. This will cause a possible increase in the spread of the disease and might be a threat to the nation,” Ethiopian Health Minister Lia Tadesse complained on Thursday.

Other behavior that could see Ethiopians jailed includes shaking hands, seating more than three people at the same table, and failing to remain more than “two adult steps” away from others.

Ethiopia has been in a declared state of emergency since April because of the virus. As of Friday, it has reported 91,693 cases and 1,396 deaths. The population of Ethiopia is about 115 million.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said this week that the pandemic “did not affect Ethiopia as it did in other countries,” thanks to “coordinated efforts” against it.

“However, the damage will be worse if we do not return to a state of normalcy while taking precautions,” he added. “Let’s keep our distance, wear masks, and keep our hands clean.”

Coronavirus infections reportedly surged in Ethiopia over the summer, combining with flooding and a plague of locusts to create a humanitarian crisis. Insect control experts said the coronavirus disrupted the supply of pesticides and special equipment needed to combat the locust swarms. Another wave of insects is expected to hit Ethiopia next year.

Human rights activists also blamed the Wuhan coronavirus for increasing child labor and child marriage in Ethiopia. Some 16 million children, as young as five years old, were estimated to be used as labor before the pandemic struck.

“Because of the economic challenges, many parents of low socio-economic status were obliged to use child labor and this might be exacerbated unless we reopen our schools,” Yhannes Wogasso of the Ethiopian Ministry of Education explained.

International observers said the pandemic disrupted Ethiopia’s systems for monitoring child labor and child marriage, and the networks that help children report abuse. They fear deepening poverty will prompt more families to keep their children out of school and send them to work instead, or marry their young daughters off.

Studies of the pandemic in Ethiopia and other African nations have yielded conflicting results. The African continent is generally seen as relatively resistant to the coronavirus because its population skews young, it has low rates of obesity, its large rural population tends to be isolated, the people are not as mobile as Americans or Europeans, and Africans are — for better and worse — more experienced at dealing with pandemics and similar health crises.

On the other hand, African nations generally lack the medical resources of Western countries, including the ability to perform widespread tests on the population, so the true number of coronavirus infections and deaths can be difficult to monitor. The Ethiopian government would appear to believe it faces a much worse coronavirus crisis than its reported number of infections and fatalities would suggest, and it could point to the looming food crisis from flooding and locusts to argue that it has limited ability to absorb another coronavirus surge."

“The Nigerian Army has announced the arrest of Lance Corporal Harrison Friday who had gone on social media to advise his colleagues not to attack #EndSARS protesters,” Punch, a Nigerian newspaper, reported on Wednesday. The newspaper referred to the national protest movement to end SARS, the now-axed Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian federal police.

In a video uploaded to social media last week, “the soldier, who was wearing a mask … asked his colleagues to understand that the protesters were fighting for a better Nigeria and they must be supported by all Nigerians including the military,” the Punch recalled.

“The fight the civilians are fighting is our fight, do not let them (the Nigerian government) use us,” Friday said in the video, according to the newspaper.

The Nigerian Army said on Wednesday that it had detained the lance corporal for his video statement.

“The hooded soldier hiding behind the mask to commit cybercrimes has been apprehended in the ongoing cyber operations in support of crocodile smile. Rest assured cybercriminals have no hiding place,” the Nigerian Army wrote in a statement posted to its official Twitter account.

Prior to his arrest, on October 19, the Nigerian Army tweeted a screenshot of Friday’s video statement in support of protesters. The words “Fake Soldier” were superimposed on the frame.

Nigerian Army “[s]oldiers attached to the 81 Division had been accused of killing protesters at the Lekki tollgate [near Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos] on Tuesday night, an allegation the army has denied,” the Punch reported on Wednesday.

The alleged attack on protesters “sparked reprisals across the state with irate youths burning down government facilities and even the family home of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu,” according to the report.

Nigeria’s government officially disbanded SARS on October 11 in response to ongoing protests calling for its dissolution. Despite the action, anti-police protests have continued across Nigeria since then, protesters demanding further police reform.

“[T]he protesters are not relenting despite the dissolution of the notorious police squad but have continued to protest noting the government’s ineffectual promises of police reforms and investigations in the past,” Nigerian newspaper the Guardian reported on October 14.

Nigeria’s national police established SARS in 1992 as a special unit to combat soaring rates of violent crime. Nigerians had regularly accused the unit of abusing its authority since its founding. Graphic footage of SARS’ alleged abuses emerged online in Nigeria over the past two weeks, sparking anti-police outrage and protests nationwide demanding the unit’s dissolution."
286,2020-10-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/10/21/reports-sudan-islamic-schools-torturing-thousands-boys/,Reports: Sudan’s Islamic Schools Torturing Thousands of Boys,"Young boys enrolled in Sudan’s state-run Islamic schools face beatings, torture, and sexual abuse at the hands of older students and teachers, according to a report by BBC Arabic published on Monday.

BBC Arabic reporter Fateh al-Rahman al-Hamdani secretly filmed inside 23 of Sudan’s Islamic schools, known as khalwas, for two years starting in 2018. Hamdani, himself a former khalwa student, admitted in his report that he would try to get through each day at the khalwa he attended “without being beaten.”

Islam predominates in Sudan, where about 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Sudan’s government institutions have been largely controlled by Muslims since the country gained independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956. Khalwas have existed in Sudan for centuries and serve as an enduring example of these Muslim-dominated institutions. According to BBC Arabic, there are currently 30,000 khalwas in operation across Sudan.

The Islamic schools are run by sheikhs (Muslim leaders) “who usually provide food, drink and shelter, free of charge. As a result, poor families often send their children to khalwas instead of public schools,” according to the report.

During his two-year-long investigation for BBC Arabic, Hamdani said he witnessed children shuffling to daily Islamic prayers in shackles.

“I saw children – some as young as five – beaten and shackled like animals,” he wrote.

“One boy with deep, raw wounds around his ankles told me: ‘We can be in groups of six or seven all chained together, and they [the sheikhs] make us run around in circles. Whenever one of us falls over we have to get up again because they keep whipping us … They say that this is good for us,'” the reporter detailed.

Hamdani said, “one of the worst experiences” he had during his investigation was his visit to “a well-respected khalwa in Darfur” in 2018:

In a study room, under a hot corrugated iron roof, a small boy was held down and whipped more than 30 times by a teacher. The only sound in the room was the lashing of the whip and the boy’s anguished cries. I wanted to grab the whip and hit the sheikh, but I knew I couldn’t.

The reporter said he later contacted the school about the incident. The khalwa’s “sheikh confirmed they do beat children but denied this incident ever took place.”

Hamdani described a separate beating of “two 14-year-old boys, Mohamed Nader and Ismail” who were severely beaten by school leaders after being caught trying to escape their khalwa.

“When I visited them in hospital they were lying on their stomachs, unconscious, their backs stripped of flesh. They were beaten and tortured so badly they nearly died,” Hamdani wrote.

“They kept them in a room for five days without food or water,” Mohamed Nader’s father, Nader, told BBC Arabic.

“They rubbed tar all over their bodies. [Mohamed Nader] has been so badly beaten you can even see his spine,” his father said.

“I had filmed inside the same khalwa where this had happened, al-Khulafaa al-Rashideen, run by a man called Sheikh Hussein,” Hamdani recalled, adding that he had seen the room where the two boys were held.

“The conditions there were the worst I had seen. Most of the boys were shackled and teachers hovered over them with whips in case they made any mistakes. One student pointed out a room with barred windows, which he described as a prison. It was the room in which Ismail and Mohamed Nader had been kept,” he said.

Hamdani said he “kept in regular contact with the boys.” One of the boys, Mohamed Nader, opened up to the reporter several months after the incident.

“They tied me up and laid me on my stomach before whipping me,” he told Hamdani, who added that the beatings lasted for days.

“A lot of people came to beat us while the rest of the khalwa was asleep. After that, I don’t know what happened, I woke up in the hospital,” Mohamed Nader said.

Police in Darfur “charged two teachers with assault, who were later released on bail,” according to the report. Despite the arrests, the school remained open.

“There is rape in the khalwa. They would call you for it, in a macho way,” Mohamed Nader told Hamdani, adding that “the smaller or weaker boys were abused by older students.”

Hamdani said that “several other people” told him “that rape happened in the khalwa under the management of Sheikh Hussein.”

The reporter later returned to the khalwa to confront Sheikh Hussein about the allegations. Hussein “admitted that it was wrong to imprison children, but maintained that shackling was ‘packed with benefits’ and that ‘most khalwas use chaining, not just me,'” according to Hamdani. The sheikh added that “he had stopped using chains and that ‘the prison’ was now a storeroom.”

When Hamdani asked Hussein “about allegations of sexual abuse he became angry, categorically denying these claims and accusing me of attacking the Qu’ran,” the reporter revealed.

Sudan’s “new transitional government is now conducting a survey of all khalwas” across the country, according to the report.

“There should be ‘no beating, torture, violation of human rights or children’s rights whatsoever’ inside khalwas,” Sudanese Minister of Religious Affairs Nasreddine Mufreh has said, promising future reform of the state-run schools."
287,2020-10-21 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/10/21/nigerian-police-open-fire-angry-mob-sets-bus-station-fire/,Nigerian Police Open Fire as Angry Mob Sets Bus Station on Fire,"Nigerian paramilitary police reportedly opened fire on protesters in several cities on Tuesday, killing and injuring dozens of people, including bystanders.

Eyewitnesses claimed they also saw military troops in camouflage uniforms shooting at the demonstrators, reports the Nigerian Army denied. The demonstrators were protesting against police brutality, particularly by a federal paramilitary unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).

Protests against SARS began in early October. The unit was established in 1992 as a special squad trained and equipped to deal with major crimes such as kidnapping and robbery. The protesters say SARS itself has become quite adept at kidnapping and robbing citizens, as well as torturing and killing prisoners.

Allegations of human rights violations dogged SARS for years, including critical reports from international organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Mass protests erupted after videos of SARS officers beating, and apparently executing, suspects began circulating online. Complaints of past abuse began flooding Nigerian social media, while a growing number of international observers joined prominent Nigerians in for immediate reform. A hashtag called #EndSARS became popular around the world.

SARS was officially disbanded on October 11, but its officers were generally reassigned to other units instead of being terminated. Protests against police brutality continued and escalated, as did the police response. The protest movement still refers to itself as EndSARS, even though SARS is technically gone.

Conditions in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, descended into anarchy on Wednesday, with reports of widespread looting and vandalism. At least one television station went off the air after protesters broke in and forced the employees to leave. Public transit buses were set on fire at a bus station. A statewide curfew was imposed, shutting down the busy Lagos airport, but unrest on the streets continued.

CNN reported on Wednesday that Nigerian police and/or military forces opened fire on the protesters at a toll plaza in Lagos. An eyewitness said, “Members of the Nigerian Army pulled up on us and they started firing … they were shooting, they were firing straight, directly at us, and a lot of people got hit.”

Witnesses said the shooting continued for up to half an hour, leaving “multiple bodies laying on the ground.” The Nigerian government pledged to investigate the incident, while the governor of Lagos sought to de-escalate the situation by instructing security forces not to arrest anyone for violating the curfew.

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was highly critical of the protest movement when he imposed the curfew on Wednesday morning.

“Dear Lagosians, I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society,” he said.

Nigeria’s Daily Trust reported dozens of people were killed in Lagos and five other cities, while “many others sustained injuries following altercations in the ongoing #EndSARS protests in different parts of the country.”

“Among the victims were security operatives, pro and anti- SARS protesters and passers-by. Business premises and vehicles were also destroyed as those for and against #EndSARS protests targeted each other,” the Daily Trust wrote, noting that “miscreants” were taking advantage of the chaos to “loot and maim in different places.”

Police officials denied fatally shooting five protesters in the city of Abuja, where protesters set a local police station and several police and commuter vehicles on fire. Witnesses said the demonstration was peaceful until the police arrived on the scene and “immediately” opened fire.

The Daily Trust quoted reports that the unrest assumed “religious and ethnic dimensions” as both a mosque and a church were set on fire in Abuja, while homes and businesses were torched in the cities of Kano and Mushin. Some locals complained the police did not deploy and restore order quickly enough to prevent the “monumental destruction of lives and property.”

Both EndSARS and pro-government counter-protesters were blamed for vandalism and violence. According to the Daily Trust report, when the police station in Lagos was set on fire, armed “hoodlums known as ‘Area Boys’” staged a jailbreak and also raided the police armor, stealing weapons, ammunition, and police uniforms. Several police officers and a customs official were reportedly killed in the violence, the latter allegedly killed by an unidentified protester while he was pursuing suspected smugglers.

The Premium Times of Nigeria said on Wednesday that at least seven people died at the Lekki toll plaza. The report described “multiple videos captured by citizens” that showed “terrified citizens crouching and screaming as gunshots rented [sic] the air.” A Nigerian artist named DJ Switch streamed the shootings live on her Instagram page.

The Premium Times cited “panic on social media” after photos were posted that appeared to show “unknown men” pulling down the closed-circuit television cameras at the Lekki plaza. Witnesses also said street lights were deliberately knocked out before the assault on the plaza began.

The Nigerian Army insisted all reports of its personnel shooting at protesters were “false,” even after reporters showed video of shooters in camouflage uniforms to a military spokesman.

Nigerian-born Manchester United soccer player Odion Ighalo was among those who did not believe the military’s denials.

“The Nigerian government, you guys are a shame to the world for killing your own citizens, sending military to the streets to kill unarmed protesters because they are protesting for their own rights? It’s uncalled for,” he said in a tweet on Wednesday.

“You people will be remembered in history as the first government to send the military to the city to start killing their own citizens,” Ighalo continued passionately, although incorrectly, since a distressing number of governments have in fact sent their military into cities to kill their own citizens, and several of them are currently sitting on the U.N. Human Rights Council.

“I am ashamed of this government, we are tired of you guys and we can’t take this anymore,” Ighalo said."

Speaking to locals in the wake of recent flooding, Godhana said that those who defy orders from both local and national authorities to vacate the wetlands in the future should be punished with “whips” as local authorities cannot afford to spend large amounts of money on rescuing victims of such natural disasters.

“Mr. County Commissioner, we will not just head for the usual rescue mission,” he said. “I urge you to equip yourselves with whips. We shall rescue as we ship individuals until they learn to obey directives.”

Godhana pointed out that local authorities have recently spent more than 20 million Kenyan shillings ($184,000) on rescuing flood victims and providing them with food and accommodations. This does not include the amount also spent by non-governmental organizations in supporting them through their ordeal.

The governor admitted that his attempts to create a “cluster program,” a project aimed at moving potential flood victims to higher ground, had not been successful because people had ignored or, in some cases, opposed it.

“This cluster program was an idea to protect you from losses, and I will stand by it to the grave even if you don’t appreciate it. But it’s for you who have been suffering for decades,” he complained.

Flooding across East Africa has added to the woes faced by the region already under intense pressure amid high poverty rates and the impact of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns. Adverse weather conditions have hit countries including Rwanda, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, and Tanzania.

According to U.N. figures, nearly six million people have been affected by the flooding, while 1.5 million of them were forced from their homes, a four-fold increase compared with five years ago. Kenya is understood to be the country hardest hit by flooding. In May, at least 194 were killed within the span of a month while hundreds of thousands were forced to flee as floods and landslides struck the country.

Drivers “pay bribes of between $14 and $40 to get a certificate indicating negative [coronavirus] status, or to cross the border without being tested,” UPDN director Omongo Ndugu, who is also vice-chairman of the Uganda Long Distance and Heavy Truck Drivers Association, told Voice of America (VOA).

The Ugandan government currently requires long-distance truck drivers to be designated coronavirus-free before they are allowed to cross the border into any other east African country. To comply with the mandate, Ugandan health authorities have set up checkpoints at major border crossings meant to verify a driver’s coronavirus status. These checkpoints cause extremely long backups on major highways leading to the border’s main crossing points, Busia and Malaba. Ngudu told VOA that truck drivers often pay bribes just to bypass these traffic jams.

“Last week there was a [traffic] jam stretching for over 65 kilometers [about 40 miles] into Kenya and the drivers were left with no option other than to respond to brokers who approached them and took bribes. And in a short while, they were shocked that they were able to receive negative [coronavirus test] results on their phone,” he said.

Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor spoke with truck drivers last week who confirmed the bribery. John Kairuki, a truck driver from Kenya, told the newspaper that he and his colleagues recently paid for negative coronavirus test results while stuck at a checkpoint: “[A]fter about an hour, we were cleared to proceed. Why should I spend many days at the border if I can get the money and pay them to cross the border easily?” he asked.

The Daily Monitor quoted “sources” who reportedly told the newspaper that, “while Kenya tests the drivers freely” for coronavirus, “Uganda charges $65” for a single coronavirus test. “As a result, Kenya run[s] out of testing kits, and now all drivers are being directed to test from Uganda,” the newspaper claimed.

According to Ndugu, Uganda’s health ministry is “highly stretched.” He told VOA that most people working to enforce coronavirus restrictions in the country receive little to no pay.

“So many of these people have chances or can end up taking bribes, because these are like part-time jobs to them. They will have to have a life after COVID [Chinese coronavirus],” he explained.

Uganda reported 10,788 infections and 97 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus at press time on Tuesday."

In return, Trump promised to remove Sudan from the U.S. government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Trump made the announcement on Twitter, where he specified that Sudan will not be delisted as a state sponsor of terrorism until those compensation checks clear:

GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2020

The East African on Tuesday reported that “African leaders, including President Uhuru Kenyatta and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, had several times called for the lifting of sanctions to help the transitional government correct mistakes of the previous regime of Omar al-Bashir.”

Sudan’s current Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok welcomed Trump’s announcement. He blamed Sudan’s past support for terrorism, including Al-Qaeda under Osama bin Laden and violence in Darfur, entirely on the Bashir regime. Bashir’s three decades of rule ended in April 2019 when he was ousted after months of protests.

“As we’re about to get rid of the heaviest legacy of Sudan’s previous, defunct regime, I should reiterate that we are peace-loving people and have never supported terrorism. We very much look forward to your official notification to Congress rescinding the designation of Sudan as a state-sponsor of terrorism, which has cost Sudan too much,” Hamdok wrote in tweets of his own.

A U.S. official told Reuters the delisting of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism could begin the process of normalizing diplomatic relations between Sudan and Israel. According to this source, “the details and timing were still being worked out” for such a diplomatic breakthrough.

“A key sticking point in the negotiations was Sudan’s insistence that any announcement of Khartoum’s de-listing not be explicitly linked to normalization with Israel. Differences remain between Sudanese political and military officials on how far and how fast to go in warming of relations with Israel,” Reuters noted.

Hamdok himself reportedly told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in August that delisting should not be directly linked to normalizing relations with Israel.

Sudanese officials said three weeks ago that negotiations to recognize Israel stalled because Sudan’s transitional government feared popular unrest unless it secured financial relief first – at least double the amount the U.S., Israel, and the United Arab Emirates were offering – and the only way to provide the desired economic security was to begin lifting sanctions against Sudan.

Sudan is still a few years away from real democracy, as Hamdok governs alongside a military junta that holds the chairmanship and half of the seats on the “Sovereign Council” established after Bashir’s ouster. The Sovereign Council is supposed to transition to civilian control next year, then cede power to an elected government in 2022.

General Abdel-Farrah Burhan, the head of the Sovereign Council, also hailed President Trump’s announcement as a “constructive step” and proper “recognition of the historic change that has taken place in Sudan.”

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that not all victims of Sudan-sponsored terrorism are pleased with the settlement deal brokered by the Trump administration.

“More than 500 of the 700 victims of the 1998 bombings at the U.S. embassies signed a letter rejecting Sudan’s settlement offer, partly because it would award more money to Americans than Africans who worked there,” the AP noted. “The letter said the plan offers compensation dependent on a victim’s nation of birth, rather than the severity of injuries.”

Other representatives for the families of victims said the settlement deal was reasonable and should be implemented swiftly by the U.S. Congress to stabilize Sudan and secure its continued cooperation in regional anti-terrorism efforts. Advocates of the deal said Sudan has been especially helpful at restraining the malevolent influence of Iran.

An important remaining order of business for Sudan will be restoring its sovereign immunity to prevent future terrorism lawsuits from being filed against it. Sudan’s claims to sovereign immunity were most recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2020, allowing a case filed by victims of the 1998 bombings at the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to move forward.

224 people were killed in those attacks, including 12 Americans. The attacks were linked to al-Qaeda, whose operatives were harbored by the Sudanese government at the time. The Bashir regime in Sudan was also accused of helping al-Qaeda move personnel, weapons, and money into Kenya to prepare for the attack on the U.S. embassy there."

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi attended the ceremony along with 1,500 cadets, a select number of whom were chosen to put their bare chests on display as part of an elaborate, action-themed parade.

The spectacle saw star cadets “pulling off stunts with rings of fire as well as breaking concrete blocks at the premises of the [police] academy in New Cairo,” the Middle East Monitor reported on Monday.

Bare-chested cadets stood proud, flexing their muscles atop makeshift floats — including tanks, boats, and a custom-built, multi-tiered platform — as the Egyptian head of state looked on.

At one point during the ceremony, the topless cadets were seen kneeling as they passed Sisi, a former Egyptian army general, along the parade route. The graduation was broadcast on Egyptian state TV and also included a swearing-in of the new officers. The graduates took an oath before Sisi to uphold Egypt’s law and constitution, and to protect the Egyptian homeland and people, according to the Arabic news website Al Ahram.

“During the ceremony, El-Sisi bestowed the second class medal of excellence on the top graduates and granted Arab and African students the same medal,” according to the report. The president congratulated the new officers and addressed their families, saying “they prepared their sons and devoted them to the country to defend us [Egyptians].”

The ceremony was also attended by Egypt’s Interior Minister, Mahmoud Tawfik, who “saluted the president for his attendance and expressed his appreciation for the fresh graduates.” In his remarks, Tawfik stressed that Egypt will show “no tolerance towards anyone who tries to undermine the security and safety of the homeland.”

In addition to demonstrating feats of strength during the parade, “[c]adets also gave a presentation on special skills for combating terrorism, breaking into terrorist and criminal hideouts, and detecting explosive devices,” according to Al Ahram.

New Cairo Police Academy Chief Major General Ahmed Ibrahim also spoke at the graduation, revealing that the academy “has prepared a cultural program for its cadets to be aware of the challenges besetting the country.” The police chief hailed “efforts exerted by the [Egyptian] interior ministry to upgrade the academy’s performance on different fronts.”

Sisi has previously attended the New Cairo Academy graduation ceremony for new police officers. Both Sisi and Interior Minister Tawfik attended the academy’s last graduation in July 2019."

Condemns Nigeria's Plan to Castrate Rapists, Execute Pedophiles","Plans by Nigeria to castrate rapists and execute pedophiles have been condemned as “draconian” by a furious Michelle Bachelet, the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The governor of Nigeria’s Kaduna state signed a law two months ago saying men convicted of rape would be subjected to surgical castration – with those found guilty of raping a child under the age of 14 would be executed, as Breitbart News reported.

Now Bachelet, the former President of Chile, has expressed her anger at the proposal.

“Tempting as it may be to impose draconian punishments on those who carry out such monstrous acts, we must not allow ourselves to commit further violations,” she said.

UN Human Rights Chief @mbachelet stands in solidarity and outrage with survivors of #rape, and those demanding justice. Tempting as it may be to impose draconian punishment, she urges we shift the focus on justice and reparation for the victim 👉 https://t.co/yuDdJC7EW0 pic.twitter.com/I0PAptrLCF — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) October 15, 2020

In a statement regarding the adoption of the law in Nigeria, Bachelet said the main argument made for instituting the death penalty is to deter rape. She argued that the belief punishment prevents sexual assaults is wrong.

The human rights chief said “the certainty of punishment, rather than its severity, deters crime.”

“Penalties like surgical castration and bilateral salpingectomy will not resolve any of the barriers to accessing justice, nor will it serve a preventive role,” Bachelet argued.

“Surgical castration and salpingectomy violate the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”

During recent periods of lockdown, the number of reported rape cases in Nigeria rose dramatically.

From March to July, Nigeria documented 717 rape cases and 7,170 unreported rapes across the country. For comparison, Nigeria’s Bureau of Statistics said that over 2,200 cases of rape and indecent assault were reported for 2017.

Despite the recent spike in rape cases, Nigeria has long suffered from high rates of sexual violence. “One in four girls and ten percent of boys have been victims of sexual violence” in Nigeria, UNICEF reported.

On May 27, a Christian university student was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death by a group of men while studying alone in a church in Benin City, Breitbart News reported. Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, 22, had gone to the local Redeemed Christian Church of God, of which she was a member, to read “in preparation for a possible reopening of school” following coronavirus lockdowns.

“We are all devastated by her death. She decided to do some private studies during the lockdown because the church was peaceful. She’s been taking the key from the parish pastor and returning it after her studies,” Olaitan Olubiyi, a spokesman for the church, said.

“But that day she didn’t return it and the night guard who resumed duty found her in a pool of her own blood and half-naked in the church hall,” he said.

The guard found Omozuwa unconscious and rushed her to a hospital shortly after. She regained consciousness briefly in the hospital and was able to provide an account of the attack. According to Omozuwa, “she had been reading all alone in the church when she was ambushed by unknown men, who beat, raped, and hit her head with a fire extinguisher.”

Omozuwa died from her injuries on May 30, according to the report. On June 2, local media reported that Nigerian police had arrested one suspect in Omozuwa’s rape and murder based on a fingerprint found on the fire extinguisher used to beat her."

“With Nigerians not backing down on protests for the reform of the police force and total disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), there are speculations that the government might shut down the internet,” Nigerian newspaper the Guardian reported.

Nigeria’s federal police founded SARS in 1992 as a special unit to combat rising rates of violent crime across the nation. Since its founding, Nigerians have regularly accused the unit of abusing its authority.

Graphic footage of SARS’ alleged abuses emerged online in Nigeria last week, sparking outrage and protests in the capital, Abuja, and across the country calling for the unit’s dissolution. In response, Nigeria’s government officially disbanded SARS on October 11.

“However, the protesters are not relenting despite the dissolution of the notorious police squad but have continued to protest noting the government’s ineffectual promises of police reforms and investigations in the past,” the Guardian reported on Wednesday. “The campaigners have also been able to organize funds to cater to their welfares during protest using digital payment platforms,” allowing the movement to continue unabated.

The anti-SARS movement originally began online before spilling onto Nigeria’s streets last week, with the hashtag “#EndSars” trending across social media in the country. Nigerians are now “speculating that the government in order to mute the campaign may clampdown on social media like its counterparts in other African countries have done in the past,” according to the report.

“Between 2016 and 2018, the authorities in South Sudan, Cameroon [and] Ethiopia … also shut down the internet in their respective countries” in response to either anti-government protests or inter-ethnic tension, the Guardian recalled. The governments of Zimbabwe, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo also forced internet shutdowns in 2019 to quell anti-government stirrings or allegedly influence elections."

“The Southern Poverty Law Center and others have filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Homeland Security over the alleged abuse of eight Cameroonians [asylum seekers] when they were at a Natchez, Miss.-based detention center,” said an October 12 report from the Dallas Morning News. The report added:

The Southern Poverty Law Center alleges eight Cameroonians were abused, beaten and forced to sign their deportation papers at the Natchez detention center. All have since been moved to Prairieland, as have others from detention centers in Louisiana, Georgia and Ohio. … “We ran from our countries to be protected here,” said Giscard Nkenglefac, a 34-year-old Cameroonian detainee who tried [to get] political asylum. “Now, when they are deporting us, our lives will be at risk.”

“We know we are sending these people back to their deaths,” Ruth Hargrove, a former prosecutor and professor who is now working as an immigration lawyer for one person from Cameroon. “I don’t understand how we as a country can do that. I don’t understand. We know exactly what we’re doing,” Hargrove told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Hundreds of millions of downtrodden people will get legal claims to migrate if the United States loosens asylum rules, responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.”There are limits to how many people we can take, and no one who is arguing for looser asylum rules ever puts forward any limiting principle,” he told Breitbart News.

Cameroon, like many other African countries, has deep internal fractures caused by diversity, an emerging civil war marked by regional and language affiliations, economic problems, and a fast-growing population expanded from 17.5 million in 2005 up to 26.5 million in 2020. Roughly 10,000 mostly middle-class Cameroonians have asked for asylum in the United States since 2016. Most have flown into South America, trekked up to the U.S. border via the Darien Gap, Guatemala, and Mexico, and then encouraged other Cameroonians to follow their footsteps.

But this African migration is being blocked by President Donald Trump’s successful deals with Mexico and other Central American countries. Those deals require the foreign government to block migrants — and also to accept detained migrants who somehow make it through their country and across the U.S. border.

In June 2019, before Trump’s deal with Mexico, NPR reported the testimony of one migrant who was living in Maine while the federal court considered his asylum request::

Michele, from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was one of the few who did speak English. He says he, his wife and three children had to leave. They fled political strife and civil unrest in January, flying to South America and trekking north, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in the Texas Del Rio sector. “Congo life is not good. The political situation is not good, and I came here,” he says, declining to give his last name. “I think I’ll have a good life.”

The repatriation effort began Tuesday:

One person who tried to block the bus chanted, “Free Them All!”

The deportation is unjustified because Cameroon’s government is torturing and killing the English-language minority who want independence, Hargrove told Breitbart News:

My client was imprisoned and tortured for being a suspected sympathizer to the Anglophone independence cause. And then after he escaped out of the Gendarmerie in Cameroon, the military issued an arrest warrant for him and stopped his brother who looks like him at a checkpoint and arrested him on the warrant and tortured him for two months and almost killed him … When you only have the testimony of one person, you have to look at it critically, and you have to see if find it credible. In the immigration courts, the law is that the testimony of the asylees, if it’s detailed and specific and consistent enough, can be the basis for getting asylum. And then, of course, you want to get corroboration from other witnesses. So in my case, I have a lot of other corroboration from the witnesses whose homes my client escaped to. I’m a cynical prosecutor, so every time you bring a case, you have to look at it from the point of view of what’s on the other side. … Hundreds of thousands of people have had their homes — their whole villages burned down in Cameroon — because they were suspected of harboring separatists … To my knowledge, they are fleeing Cameroon because the English-speaking people are the victim of genocide by the Francophone government. … From my perspective, with my [Cameroonian] client, I’m not saying we open the doors for everybody. I’m saying let’s not send a man back who has a legitimate claim of persecution. To me, it’s a pretty easy call. Our own State Department and Congress have said they’re essentially [suffering] a genocide. It’s a relatively small group of people. It is inconsistent with our asylum laws to send those people back without giving them a full opportunity to establish their case … probably 90 percent of these people are unrepresented [by lawyers].

Hargrove also has a personal interest in the case:

I was named after my aunt, who died in Auschwitz. When she was 19, and we [in the United States] wouldn’t let her in. I don’t think she would have been a drain, and the reason I don’t think she would have been a drain is that my father somehow made his way in. And he had $6 when he arrived when he was 16 years old … He got a graduate degree. He raised two daughters — the first women in his family who went to college — I became a lawyer and my sister has an MBA.

The migrants are not going to be an economic drain, she said.

“I can tell you that every single Cameroonian that I have worked with is desperate to get a work permit and is desperate to work … because the ones I know are not an economic drain because they’re working two and three jobs, and they’re working legally,” she said.

Every migrant expands the economy by working and consuming, and “the fact that they’re Africans isn’t the issue,” countered Krikorian.

“But If 20, 30, 40 million people were to move to the United States from developing countries, it would have a profound effect on the society, politics, and economy of the country. It would immiserate large shares of the American workforce by driving down wages, by changing the nature of work so that even more occupations will become [socially] acceptable for Americans to work in. It would create enormous burdens on the welfare system because people with little education — no matter how hard they do work — can’t earn enough to feed their own children in a developed economy and will inevitably be using taxpayer-funded services.”

Open-ended legal migration is praised by progressives and immigration lawyers — partly because the arrival of migrants helps to shift wealth from wage-earners to stockholders, from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from homebuyers to real estate investors, from the central states to the coastal states. Migration also allows investors to ignore labor-saving technology, to sideline U.S. minorities, to rely on stoop labor in the fields and manual labor in the cities. It expands the power of executives over professionals, slows technological innovation, increases the cost of having children, and slashes labor rights."

Zimbabwe’s Chimanimani National Park, normally a major tourist attraction, has seen a significant decline in visitors during the coronavirus pandemic, largely due to travel restrictions. Locals have taken advantage of the lack of tourists to mine for gold in the park’s mountains in recent months.

“For the past couple of years, we have been seeing illegal gold miners in the mountains, but suddenly during lockdown we started to see hundreds of them,” Collen Sibanda, vice chairman of the Chimanimani Tourist Association (CTA), told Reuters.

According to the news agency, “Activists, industry experts, and some of the miners themselves say rangers employed by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) to protect Chimanimani National Park are involved in the illicit activity.”

“Zimparks is recruiting people. They are organizing these syndicates,” Sibanda said.

Zimbabwe is currently suffering from its worst economic crisis in over a decade, battling crippling hyperinflation and record-high unemployment. The dire economic circumstances have forced an increasing number of young Zimbabweans to turn to illegal activities, such as gold mining in protected parks, to earn a living.

A man named Lenny Kwaramba told Reuters that he had been mining for gold in the Chimanimani mountains without a license since March.

“I thought it was legal because we were working with the rangers,” he explained.

“We were given a target, we would sell about 40 grams of gold per day,” he said. Kwaramba described how “as the miners came back down the mountain, the rangers would take the gold and pay them in U.S. dollars.”

Zimbabwe deployed members of its military and police to the national park in August to “help the rangers evict the miners,” according to the report.

“I had to run for my life,” Kwaramba claimed. “They were firing at us. Some [miners] were injured and others are missing,” he added.

Zimparks spokesman Tinashe Farawo told Reuters that park authorities were aware of claims that Chimanimani’s rangers were directly involved in the illegal gold mining.

“We have heard such reports. We are currently investigating the allegations,” he told the news agency.

While no official data exists on the number of illegal gold miners in the Chimanimani Mountains, Zimbabwe government authorities admit that reports of the illicit activity have significantly increased over the past few years.

Recent reports indicate that gold panning in the mountains remains mostly small-scale and informal.

The estimated “output from artisanal gold panning in the area [of Chimanimani] from 2007 to 2011 was between 600-to-900 kg per year, with less than half of that amount being officially recorded,” the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London reported in 2016."

“The claim that violent crime on farms is part of an orchestrated campaign by blacks to drive white farmers off their land is simply not borne out by fact,” claimed the president, who is himself pursuing a policy of land grabs — or “land expropriation without compensation” — against landowners.

“Killings on farms are not ethnic cleansing,” he insisted.

“They are not genocidal. They are acts of criminality and must be treated as such.”

Hundreds of white farmers bearing ‘Boer Lives Matter’ slogans had marched on rural Senekal magistrates’ court as 32-year-old Sekwetje Mahlamba and 44-year-old Sekola Matlaletsa appeared to face charges for the murder of 21-year-old farm manage Brendin Horner.

Horner had been found strung up on a pole by his neck, having been beaten, stabbed repeatedly, and apparently tortured. Demonstrators demanded that Mahlamba and Matlaletsa be handed over to them, ultimately forcing their way into the courthouse and managing to come within a few feet of the suspects before being beaten back by police.

Outside the courthouse, protesters overturned a police van and set it on fire, having to be dispersed with stun grenades.

Farm murders in South Africa have also been highlighted in recent days by rising mixed martial arts star Dricus Du Plessis, a former KSW and EFC champion who used his victorious UFC debut to shed light on the issue.

“This is a great opportunity for me to step up and… talk about things, I mean, South Africa’s going through so much… we have farm murders that’s really taking the whole country by storm,” said the middleweight knockout artist.

“It’s something unbelievable, people are getting murdered daily… I feel because it’s Africa a lot of the world doesn’t see it, nobody in the world really knows what’s going on there, and I just want to shout out to South Africa, to my South African people, and say guys, folks, stay strong,” he said.

“The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) of the Nigeria Police Force has been dissolved with immediate effect,” Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s office said in a statement.

Nigeria’s Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, said on October 11 that the national police would soon announce new measures, such as implementing a “new policing arrangement” to replace Sars and redeploying Sars officers to other units. Adamu had previously dismissed the prospect of disbanding Sars but said that officials had changed their minds in response to recent anti-Sars protests, which he referred to as “the yearnings of the Nigerian people.”

Nigeria’s federal police founded Sars in 1992 to combat rising rates of violent crime across the country. Since then, citizens have regularly accused the unit of abusing its authority.

Prior to Sunday’s announcement, graphic footage of Sars’ alleged abuses had emerged online over the past week, sparking protests across Nigeria demanding the government disband the unit.

The movement began online at first, with “EndSars” trending across social media in Nigeria. The outrage soon spilled onto Nigerian streets, with people marching in Lagos and in other cities throughout the country.

“Armed police in the capital, Abuja, used force against protesters who were marching as the decision to dissolve it [Sars] was announced,” U.K. newspaper the Guardian reported on Sunday.

Some videos posted to social media in Nigeria this weekend appear to show police officers firing live rounds at protesters. Other videos seem to show security forces using teargas and a water cannon against protesters.

Clashes between police officers and protesters turned deadly in parts of southern Nigeria, according to the report.

Bangladeshi Istiaque A. is one of the ten people arrested aged between 16 and 24 in the aftermath of the terror attack last Monday that saw radical Islamic terrorist Kujtim F. kill four people in a shooting spree in central Vienna.

The arrested teen is said to have been previously arrested and charged in October with being involved with the Islamic State terrorist group since March of 2018 and is reported to have supported Vienna killer Kujtim F., who wanted to travel to Syria to fight for the group, Kronen Zeitung reports.

Austria: Mosques Dissolved, Raided After Radical Islamic Terror Attack https://t.co/5p9FZyV0E6 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 8, 2020

According to investigators, the Bangladeshi is said to have spread various Islamic state propaganda material online, including songs calling for violent jihad against “infidels.”

His potential involvement in the Vienna terrorist attack is still under investigation according to the newspaper.

The arrest of the teen, along with nine others, comes as part of a broader crackdown on radical Islamists by the Austrian government headed by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

Last week, two mosques in Vienna linked to radical Islamist ideologies were raided and dissolved by the government, one of which was said to have been directly connected to Kujtim F. and may have played a part in his radicalisation.

On Monday, investigators conducted large-scale raids on more than 60 addresses linked to radical Islamists with Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer stating the goal of the raids was “cutting off the roots of political Islam.”

Austrian Government Launches Raids Against Islamic Radicals https://t.co/ftPPuyIs0o — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2020

In the region of Styria, the local prosecutor’s office stated it was “carrying out investigations against more than 70 suspects and against several associations which are suspected of belonging to and supporting the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas organisations.”

Graz, the largest city in Styria, has been known as a hotbed for radical Islam in recent years and was labelled a “stronghold” for Islamists in 2017 by experts who claimed that 11 of the 20 mosques in the city had Islamist ties."

The operation came a week after a convicted Islamic State group supporter killed four people in a shooting rampage in the heart of Vienna, but prosecutors said the raids were not linked to the attack.

Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the police action was aimed at “cutting off the roots of political Islam”.

The Styria region prosecutors’ office said it was “carrying out investigations against more than 70 suspects and against several associations which are suspected of belonging to and supporting the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas organisations”.

It said “the operation has no connection to the terror attack in Vienna of November 2” but was the result of “intensive and comprehensive investigations carried out for more than a year”.

Among the alleged offences are forming a terrorist association, financing of terrorism and money laundering.

The raids took place in the Styria, Carinthia, Lower Austria and Vienna regions.

– ‘Hostile ideology’ –

“We are acting against these criminal, extremist and inhuman organisations with all our strength,” Nehammer said in a statement.

The prosecutors’ statement said the operation “was not targeted at Muslims or Islam as a religious community”.

“On the contrary these measures are also intended to protect Muslims, whose religion is abused for the purposes of an ideology hostile to the constitution,” it said.

Last Monday’s shooting was the first major attack of its kind in Austria for decades and the first blamed on a jihadist.

The gunman was identifed as Kujtim Fejzulai, 20, a dual Austrian-Macedonian national who was convicted last year of trying to go to Syria to join IS.

Austria has acknowledged security lapses in the run-up to the attack, including failing to act on warnings about Fejzulai and his contacts from Germany and Slovakia.

The head of Vienna’s anti-terror agency was suspended last week after further revelations came to light about intelligence failings.

Last week the government also ordered the closure of two mosques in Vienna frequented by the attacker.

Meanwhile, European Council President Charles Michel and France’s European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune will visit Vienna on Monday to meet Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and to discuss cross-border cooperation in the fight against terror.

Kurz will also take part in talks via video link with French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country has been hit by a spate of jihadist attacks."

Cedric Richmond (D-LA), the co-chairman of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, acknowledged some of the branding associated with the so-called progressive wing of the Democratic Party did not help their cause on Election Day.

Richmond said his party’s association with the “defund the police” slogan hurt it in House elections.

“Our progressive wing of the party is very important to our party But I think that what Whip Clyburn was trying to say that, no matter how progressive your ideals and values are and what you want to do and how bold your plans are, if we don’t win, if we don’t keep the majority of the House, you cannot implement any of those plans. So, you can’t govern if you can’t win. And so I think our party has to make sure that we have a solid playbook of what we want to do, how we want to help the American people. But, when we lose, and if we lose the House of Representatives, then we will be in the minority and we won’t pass a bill for at least two years. And I think that that — his point is, we have to make sure we win first and govern second.”

“And so, when we govern, we will govern with our values,” Richmond continued. “But when we can’t pass legislation, we shouldn’t be out there talking about it. And some titles hurt. Defunding the police is a title that hurts Democrats, and especially when the fact of the matter is, nobody’s calling for defunding the police. We’re calling for reinventing how we police communities in this country, how we do criminal justice. So, I think that, basically, what the whip is saying, and I agree with, is that words have consequences. And, in this election, those words cost us some Democratic members.”

BLM marchers took to the streets of DC on Saturday night, shouting “Burn it down, Burn it down,” Breitbart News reported. As they made their way into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, they became increasingly critical of the evening’s earlier celebrations.

“For all of you f—ng journalists, for all of you white liberals who have been celebrating, getting drunk off your asses about Biden winning this election, you are all a bunch of f—ng fools!” one man can be heard yelling on a bull horn, journalist Andy Ngo tweeted.

“You are using this plaza as a tourist attraction,” he continued, “You are all acting like this is f**king Disney World. This is not f**king Disney World.”

“You will not colonize this space,” he told the Biden supporters who previously partied on the plaza. “We will not have it here.”

He continued chastising the Biden supporters and said BLM is not going anywhere.

“We are still gonna be here protesting, fighting, advocating for our Blacks, for our Brown, indigenous, queer, non-binary, people who have been killed by police,” the man concluded.

Another man took the bull horn and told the Biden supporters to go home.

“This isn’t over,” he began. “you were not here much. You shouldn’t be out here right now.”

“Go home,” he told the Biden supporters. “Unless you are with this movement, go home. It’s not a party. We’ll be back. Don’t worry.”

The two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in the province of Liège after raids were conducted in Eupen and La Calamine.

According to investigators, the two teens pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and recorded a video of themselves doing so, 7sur7 reports.

The federal prosecutor’s office released a statement on Thursday praising the work of the federal judicial police and local prosecutors, saying that “a rapid intervention was carried out and possible criminal acts were prevented.”

Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne’s office also commented on the arrests, saying: “This case shows that our security services are alert, but also proves that the danger is certainly not ruled out.”

The minister’s office added that the country’s security services were actively “patrolling” on social media following the Islamic terrorist attacks in France and Austria in recent weeks.

Several countries, including the United Kingdom, are on alert after the terrorist attack earlier this week in Vienna.

Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that Britain would increase the terror threat from “substantial to “severe”, saying: “This is a precautionary measure and is not based on any specific threat. The public should continue to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police.”

The man behind the Vienna attack, which left four dead and 17 injured, was also a sympathiser of the Islamic State.

Kujtim F. had previously been arrested for trying to join ISIS in Syria and was sentenced to prison for 22 months, but was released early. He was also placed into a deradicalisation programme which he is said to have fooled into thinking he was reformed.

Culture Minister Susanne Raab and Interior Minister Karl Nehammer announced the closure of the mosques on Friday, one of which is said to have contributed to the radicalisation of the Vienna gunman who killed four people on Monday.

Minister Raab defended the closures stating, “It is not an attack against the members of a religious community, but it is a common fight against the abuse of a religion by radicals.”

According to a report from newspaper Kronen Zeitung, the gunman was active in two mosques in the Austrian capital.

The first, the Tewhid Mosque located in the district of Meidling, was raided Friday morning by police and the Vienna special police unit WEGA but so far no information has been released regarding possible arrests made during the raid.

The mosque was under the jurisdiction of the Islamic Religious Community (IGGÖ), the largest Islamic community organisation in Austria. The group has been criticised int he past for its connections to Turkey and alleged connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.

The IGGÖ, meanwhile, have condemned the Vienna terrorist attack, and its president, Ümit Vural stated: “This is an ideology that approves of violence, that dehumanises and which we deeply reject.”

The Melit Ibrahim Mosque, located in the district of Ottakring, was also dissolved, according to Raab, and is believed to have played a part in the radicalisation of the Vienna terrorist.

According to Kronen Zeitung, the mosque was also attended regularly by Albanian-born Lorzenz K., who was sentenced to nine years in prison after his arrest in 2017 for plotting a terrorist attack and being a member of the Islamic State terrorist group.

Lorenz K. was back in court in September of this year after he had threatened to behead a fellow inmate who he stated was not a real Muslim.

The Los Angeles Times, in an article titled, “LAPD to dramatically downsize special units, focus on patrol as budget cut shrinks force,” reported Saturday:

The Los Angeles Police Department in coming months will downsize its specialized units and stop responding in person to traffic collisions and other minor incidents as part of a broad reorganization aimed at preserving patrol and community engagement functions amid new fiscal constraints. Although specific figures weren’t available Friday, the reshuffling will reduce the size of the vaunted but troubled Metropolitan Division, as well as cut the air support, robbery and homicide and gang and narcotics divisions. … [The cuts] also come as homicides and shootings soar to levels not seen in the city in a decade, ratcheting up concerns in some communities that the changes could cost lives. Homicides are up by about 25% this year, compared with last, putting the city on pace to surpass 300 killings for the first time since 2009. More broadly, the cuts represent a new trajectory for one of the largest and most scrutinized police agencies in the country — and reflect how fully it has been forced to bend to the “Defund Police” movement, which garnered attention and momentum this summer when activists and other protesters rallied in massive numbers in the streets and barraged local elected officials with demands in person and during virtual Zoom meetings.

In June, with riots still raging in the city, Garcetti promised to cut the police budget by up to $150 million — more than 10% of the total — as part of an effort to redistribute the funds to “communities of color” through various organizations and projects.

“I dropped my phone,” he yells at an unidentified person. “Get my phone. It was right there.” A young white man appears to block the path of the man to keep him from going to where he believes his phone is located.

Suddenly, as the young man looks away, the older man begins throwing multiple punches — striking the man in the head and face multiple times. As he retreats, someone wrestles him to the ground.

In an apparent concern over optics, one of the organizers yells over the PA system, “Come on! The last thing we want to do is see a Black man get arrested by the Police.”

The incident took place at the same rally where a Black man danced with a Black Lives Matter flag in his right hand and the effigy of a beheaded Donald Trump in his left, Breitbart News reported.

People in the crowd danced and sang “F*ck Donald Trump” while holding up an extended middle finger.

The protests throughout Manhattan began with a combination of a “Donald Trump is over” dance party and Black Lives Matter protest in Washington Square Park, the New York Post reported.

One protester, in what was potentially a political statement, took off his clothes and jumped into a fountain while dancing and shouting, “I’m Nevada!”

The night had none of the violence that previous nights did when three female protesters were arrested Wednesday for allegedly punching and kicking police officers, and Thursday, when a man allegedly strangled an officer with a chain.

Friday night’s protesters eventually wound up in Chelsea, where many of the protesters danced to the Cha-Cha Slide across 23rd Street before they scattered away without incident.

There was at least one arrest among the stragglers who stayed behind at Washington Square Park after the park’s midnight closing."

Rachel Menard, 23, Elizabeth Barter, 28, and Christine Brown, 23, all face charges related to punching or kicking police officers, the New York Post reported.

Menard allegedly punched NYPD Assistant Chief Stephen Hughes in the face twice as he was arresting William Beaudoin in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan.

Menard was arraigned Thursday on one count of felony second-degree assault and one count of obstructing government administration. She was released without bail.

Barter allegedly ignored several orders to stop blocking a West Village street before shoving an unidentified person, according to the complaint.

When Deputy Inspector Andrew Hillery came to arrest her, she allegedly “kicked him in the leg.” She also had pepper spray dangling from a keychain.

Barter was hit with five misdemeanor charges, including resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, attempted assault, and unlawful possession of a noxious material. She was released without bail.

Brown was arraigned on six misdemeanor counts for allegedly interfering with the NYPD’s arrest of others by “placing her body and her bicycle” between them. Brown also allegedly kicked the arresting officer in the shin.

She was charged with assault, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration. She, like the other two women, was released without bail.

More than a dozen protesters were arrested Thursday night, a total of 19 people arrested for resorting to violence during a protest, CBS New York reported. On Wednesday night, nearly 60 people were arrested."

The Moroccan, named Hamza, is said to have met the victim at a campsite last summer and soon moved in with her in the commune of Périgny, a suburb of the city of La Rochelle.

“He came back with me to Périgny to help him make his papers for his residence permit. He put down his bag and moved in with me,” the young woman named Marie said.

According to a report from the French news platform Actu, the violence against Marie took place from September to mid-October of this year and she reported Hamza to police on October 23rd.

According to her statements, Marie said that Hamza had been violent toward her and had sexually abused her while refusing to leave her home.

The Morrocan migrant refuted her claims in court and claimed that she had called police as “revenge” because he wanted to leave her.

Caroline Fernandez, the prosecutor in the case, noted that the Moroccan had 19 prior criminal accusations, two of which were for prior domestic abuse.

While the prosecutor called for an eight-month term, the judge in the case handed down a ten-month term with four months suspended and an order banning the migrant from the Charente-Maritime department for the next two years.

The case comes after a number of other cases in France involving migrant violence toward those who have helped migrants in the past.

One such case took place earlier this year in Cherbourg when a 20-year-old Afghani migrant admitted to killing the 63-year-old president of a pro-migrant group by breaking into his house and bludgeoning him with an iron rod.

In 2019, pro-migrant activist Audrey Coignard was found dead after being stabbed around a dozen times and her former boyfriend, a migrant from Sudan, was later arrested.

The French leader said he would be proposing to the European Council next month an overhaul to the EU’s Schengen agreement, including “greater control” within the political bloc.

President Macron also stated that he would be doubling the number of police and customs staff manning France’s own borders from 2,400 to 4,800 to fight against illegal migration as well as terrorist threats to his country, France Info reports.

‘Not on French Soil’ – Macron Says Islamists Who Want to Follow Anti-Enlightenment Values Should Leave https://t.co/6RXHUiy8J3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 2, 2020

“Terrorist actions can be carried out by people who use immigration flows,” Macron said on Thursday.

The statement comes after two terrorist attacks in the last several weeks in France, both of which involved migrants.

The first saw a Chechen migrant with refugee status murder teacher Samuel Paty in the street and behead him after he had shown cartoons of the Islamic prophet Mohammed to his class during a lesson on free speech. The drawings had previously been published by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

The second terror attack, which took place in a church in the city of Nice, also involved a Tunisian migrant who had come across the Mediterranean earlier this year and landed illegally on the Italian island of Lampedusa.

The revelation led Italian populist Senator Matteo Salvini to ask how many other potential terrorists had come into Europe through migrant routes, saying: “How many are to disappear like him after landing? I think there are thousands of them. Yet there are mugshots and footprints of each of them.”

Since the murder of Samuel Paty, President Macron has also vowed to crack down on Islamist-linked associations. Macron has been recently joined in that call by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz following the Vienna terror attack.

Macron Govt Proposes Dissolving Major Islamist Associations After Teacher Beheading https://t.co/N90nY0RouO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2020

Chancellor Kurz stated on Wednesday that he was in contact with Macron and called on the EU to focus on combatting political Islam.

“Now, it is important that we resolutely continue the fight. Not only against Islamist terrorism but also against the ideological basis behind it — that is, against political Islam and radical Islamism,” Kurz said."

Lacey was held responsible by Black Lives Matter for alleged police brutality. Her challenger won the support of the Democratic Party establishment in the state — including L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who withdrew his previous endorsement of Lacey and threw his support to the Soros-backed Gascon in early October.

As Breitbart News reported before the election:

In 2018, as Breitbart News reported at the time, Soros spent heavily on left-wing candidates for district attorney posts around the nation, often backing “progressive” candidates against establishment Democrats. He spent nearly $4 million in total. The results are evident in a wave of politicized prosecutions — or, in the case of Chicago’s Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax, non-prosecutions. Soros-backed prosecutors have backed the Black Lives Matter movement, selectively enforcing the law. In Los Angeles, the movement targeted Lacey. As Breitbart News noted: “[Protesters] accuse her of being too tough on crime. In March, Black Lives Matter activists marched to Lacey’s door in the wee hours of the morning — and Lacey’s husband confrontedthem with a gun and told them to leave. He now faces criminal charges in that incident.” In August, Gov. Gavin Newsom backed Gascon. As Breitbart News noted: Gascón is a left-wing prosecutor with a controversial history. He previously served as district attorney in San Francisco, as Politico notes, working with then-Mayor Newsom to roll back policing — but leaving a city synonymous with vagrancy today, and backing Proposition 47, which put more convicted criminals back on the streets: Newsom’s choice reflects his long history with Gascón: When he was mayor of San Francisco, Newsom tabbed Gascón to be chief of police and then elevated him to San Francisco district attorney to fill the post that Kamala Harrisvacated after she became state attorney general. During his tenure as San Francisco’s top cop, Gascón became a leading figure in California’s swing away from tough-on-crime policies, embracing measures like a ballot initiative to reduce drug and theft crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. Gascón was encouraged to run by the Real Justice PAC, an organization co-founded by radical left-wing Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, who is publicly refusing to denounce riots in Kenosha. As the California Globe recently reported, Soros has spent $2.5 million on Gascon’s campaign. He has a left-wing record, including support for prison reform and the end of cash bail. Moreover, the Globe noted: Under Gascón as San Francisco District Attorney: property crimes increased nearly 50%;

auto thefts in San Francisco jumped to 10% of the statewide average;

San Francisco had the highest property crime in the state;

violent crime was 54% higher than the rest of the state and 82% higher than the national average;

drug addiction soared.

Lacey is the first African American woman to hold the post.

The 27-year-old had been living in the Greek city of Tripoli where he had been helped by NGOs, although there is no evidence the groups knew his extremist background.

According to a report from Greek newspaper Proto Thema, the man was living in Tripoli with his wife and children. His wife is allegedly a known dissident in their native Tajikistan. The man was wanted on an international arrest warrant.

Greek Court Jails Syrian Asylum Seeker for Islamic State Membership https://t.co/NexeU37QDM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 19, 2018

He was arrested at random during a police check outside of the city, where police discovered he had been “red-flagged” and was wanted internationally. The local prosecutor and Greece’s counter-terrorism service are examining the case.

According to Kathimerini, Tajikistan authorities consider him a high-ranking Islamic State official. The migrant claims, however, that his wife is the sister of the opposition leader in their home country, and that the warrant was issued against him for political reasons.

He arrived in Greece in 2017 after travelling through Turkey and landing on the Aegean island of Lesbos, where he registered at the notorious Moria camp which was burned down by some of its migrant residents in September.

The arrest is just the latest to see a suspected member of Islamic State taken into custody after coming to Europe as an asylum seeker.

In 2016, the Federal German Intelligence service (BND) claimed that hundreds of Islamic State fighters had come to Europe disguised as asylum seekers. That same year an ISIS “commander” was arrested in a small German village where he lived as a refugee.

In 2017 it was also revealed that the terror group was paying cash to migrants to cover their travel costs if they were willing to wage jihad once they arrived in Europe.

The incident took place on Wednesday outside a primary school in the commune of Athis-Mons, some 14 miles outside of Paris.

A police source stated that “a teacher heard threats twice as she was taking a break outside the school”, newspaper Le Figaro reports.

“The man said to those present: ‘By Allah, the prophet, I will avenge you, these filthy teachers will pay for it’,” the police source said. A local police union general-secretary confirmed the suspect’s arrest took place the same day.

Jean-Jacques Grousseau, Mayor of Athis-Mons, said that the police had been fully mobilised over the incident and have been investigating and securing local schools.

The incident comes just weeks after French teacher Samuel Paty was murdered and beheaded on the streets of the commune of Conflans-Saint-Honorine, about 20 miles outside of Paris.

Paty was killed by a Chechen teen refugee who had been motivated by the fact the teacher had shown cartoons of the Islamic prophet Mohammed to his class during a lesson on freedom of speech, the drawing having been published by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Since the attack, other teachers have come forward to speak out about the spread of Islamist ideas in their schools among their pupils.

Officials later identified the woman as 24-year-old Devina Singh, the New York Post reported.

She back up for a second and then lunges back into the officer’s face, again shouting, “Fuck you, fascist.”

As the officer attempts to pull his COVID-19 protective mask over his nose, Singh lunges forward again spitting directly into the officer’s face.

She again retreats to the wall. After a brief pause, the officer grabs Singh and puts her on the ground. He places her under arrest, presumably for assaulting a police officer.

Other officers move bicycles into position to protect the officer while he makes the arrest.

Rosner reported another protester yelled, “You don’t attack a woman!” as he places her in custody.

Another tense standoff occurred a few moments later. Officers continued to make arrests.

Biden: 4,491 (33%) Biden lead has now shrunk to 16,952. There are ~29k regular ballots remaining, 48k provisional. If provisionals are people who requested VBM but then went to polling place on Election Day probably good for DJT. — Chris Buskirk (@thechrisbuskirk) November 9, 2020

The Trump campaign has maintained that claims of an Arizona victory for Biden were premature.

According to reports, the president will hold campaign rallies to draw attention to his legal battles, including in Arizona.

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has already extended a “formal” invitation.

“Mr. President: This is a formal invitation to hold a rally in Phoenix. Your people are here for you and will not accept fraud and theft of this election. @realDonaldTrump @AZGOP @VP @ali @GOPChairwoman,” he said:"

Jeb Bush (R) congratulated Joe Biden on Saturday for reportedly winning the 2020 presidential election after establishment media outlets called the election in favor of the former vice president.

“Congratulations to President-elect Biden. I have prayed for our President most of my adult life. I will be praying for you and your success,” Bush wrote. “Now is the time to heal deep wounds. Many are counting on you to lead the way.”

Bush’s statement comes as CNN, MSNBC, and the Associated Press (AP) called the election for Biden on Saturday morning.

President Donald Trump’s lawyers continue to challenge votes in Pennsylvania. Trump wrote in a statement on Saturday that he plans to challenge potentially fraudulent votes. Trump said:

Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.

Meanwhile, Trump has closed the gap in Arizona between him and Biden below 30,000 votes.

“Of the 173,000 ballots that remain, about 126,000 are non-provisional ballots,” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) explained. “The majority of those, 92,000, are from Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix.”

The Trump campaign contended that the margin is too early to call the state for Biden, and that Trump will win it.

The Republican majority in the Michigan state House plans to hold hearings regarding fraud claims.

Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R) said, “Every single legal vote needs to be counted, regardless of who cast it or who they voted for.”

“And then the candidate who wins the most of those votes will win Michigan’s electoral votes, just like it always has been. Nothing about that process will change in 2020,” he added.

One wine shop near campus reported that sales increased 96 percent during election week.

According to a report by the Cornell student newspaper, liquor sales at stores surrounding campus rose significantly on election week. The spike in liquor sales follows a national trend, which saw increased alcohol sales around the country in the run-up to and aftermath of election night.

Ithaca Wine and Spirits, a liquor store just steps away from campus, told the student newspaper that their sales had increased by 96 percent. The store’s owner, Milany Papachryssanthou, said that the store sold record amounts of scotch, vodka, and tequila.

Three out of five students shopping at Collegetown Wine and Spirits told a student reporter that they were drinking in response to the election. When asked by a student reporter if they planned to drink as election results came in, one group of students said that alcohol was helping them get through the stress-inducing week. “Yes, how else are we going to get through it?” the group said.

The New York Post reported last week that New York City residents were purchasing alcohol in large amounts in the days leading up to the election.

“We are having three times the business we normally do, it’s been insane!” one Manhattan liquor store owner said. “All my regulars are stocking up [and] a lot of my customers are having election night parties”

Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates"
571,2020-11-07 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/11/07/rahm-emanuel-to-fired-retail-workers-you-can-learn-to-code/,Rahm Emanuel to Fired Retail Workers: You Can Learn to Code!,"Laid-off retail workers should learn to code for new software jobs, says Democrat heavyweight Rahm Emanuel.

“There’s going to be people, like at J.C. Penney and other retail [outlets]. Those jobs are not coming back,” Emanuel told ABC News November 6.

“Give them the tools, six months, you’re going to become a computer coder. We’ll pay for it, and you’ll get millions of people to sign up for that,” Emanuel said. “They are not going back to parts of the retail economy, and we need to give them a lifeline to what’s the next chapter.”

On ABC, Rahm Emanuel literally says a Biden White House should tell people laid off from retail stores like JC Penney to learn to code. He actually said this. Amazing. pic.twitter.com/xlSnVi7445 — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 7, 2020

Even if older American retail workers can learn the skills, Emanuel’s plan would likely fail because Fortune 500 companies prefer to hire foreign visa workers instead of hiring the existing supply of American young software professionals.

And the government quietly delivers this resident army of at least 1.5 million white-collar visa workers via the Optional Practical Training program, the H-1B visa program, as well as via the J-1, L-1, H4EAD, E-3, Curricular Practical Training, TN, and B-1/B-2 programs.

Emanuel may not know about this huge labor policy, even though he is a former chief of staff to former President Barack Obama and also a former mayor of Chicago.

Most of these foreign workers are imported from low-tier universities in India and work for many years at low wages in mid-skill jobs in the hope of getting green cards and citizenship delivered via a current or future employer. Some work as H-1B contractors at brand name companies, like Facebook and Amazon, but most compliantly serve as gig workers for little-known subcontractors in the hope of getting the huge deferred bonus of green cards.

CEOs at Fortune 500 companies quietly outsource many of their full-time jobs to this huge “Green Card Workforce,” so cutting their payroll costs and boosting their near-term stock values for shareholders and C-suite executives.

This green card outsourcing prevents many American graduates from getting paid jobs where they can use the degrees they earned with borrowed tuition money. This outsourcing also pushes many experienced American professionals from mid-career jobs, while millions more face lower salaries and persistent job insecurity.

Corporate diversity reports, university reports, and census data show that large slices of the nation’s technology workforce consist of ill-paid, ill-treated foreign workers who have the same job security and professional authority as migrant stoop workers in U.S. fields.

The foreigners’ limited skills and lack of workplace rights help to reduce productivity, lower the quality of software, and slow research. But those losses are acceptable because the foreign workers successfully minimize U.S. professionals’ role in the sector, so minimizing the formation of innovative rival companies.

So this labor policy delivers workplace stability, cheaper graduates, and higher stock values to the current executives and leading shareholders of the Fortune 500 companies.

However, President Trump has begun to reform this green card workforce to steer many of these white-collar jobs back to Americans.

In contrast, Joe Biden’s 2020 plan would import many foreign workers for jobs that retail workers can accomplish with pride.

He promised to “reassert America’s commitment to asylum-seekers and refugees,” to wipe out Trump’s asylum reforms, bar any deportations for 100 days, and end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony.

Biden also promised to let companies import more visa workers, let mayors import temporary workers, and allow an unlimited flow of foreign graduates through U.S. universities into white-collar jobs. He would “exempt from any cap [the] recent graduates of Ph.D. programs in STEM fields.”

Biden also wants to accelerate the inflow of chain migration migrants and dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year."

The funds were uncovered through an agreement between the government and an unnamed hacker that acquired the bitcoin when the marketplace was still active.

According to a report by the Verge, the U.S. government has seized $1 billion in Bitcoin from the Silk Road, a darknet drug marketplace that was shut down in 2013.

United States Attorney David L. Anderson said that the seizure of the funds has closed the door on a question that has lingered since the closure of the marketplace over seven years ago.

“Silk Road was the most notorious online criminal marketplace of its day,” Anderson said. “The successful prosecution of Silk Road’s founder in 2015 left open a billion-dollar question. Where did the money go? Today’s forfeiture complaint answers this open question at least in part. $1 billion of these criminal proceeds are now in the United States’ possession.”

The press release suggests that law enforcement officials were able to seize the cryptocurrency on November 3 from an individual that had acquired the funds from the Silk Road by allegedly hacking the site. It is not clear at this time if the unnamed hacker has been arrested.

The complaint alleges that these funds were traced to a bitcoin address. Further investigation of that bitcoin address by the United States Attorney’s Office and IRS CI agents revealed that the funds were connected to Individual X. It was further determined that Individual X had hacked the funds from Silk Road. Pursuant to that investigation of the hack, law enforcement seized several thousand Bitcoins on November 3, 2020. On November 4, 2020, the seized Bitcoin had a value of over $1 billion.

The unnamed hacker was reportedly threatened by Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht after Ulbricht realized that the funds had been compromised. Ulbricht is currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years in the United States Penitentiary in Tuscon, Arizona, for crimes connected to the Silk Road."
573,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/11/06/racial-gap-unemployment/,"Black and Hispanic Unemployment Fall, Narrowing Gap with Whites","The U.S. jobless rate fell faster for blacks and Hispanics than whites in October, narrowing the unemployment gap between the races, Labor Department data released on Friday showed.

Black unemployment fell from 12.1 percent to 10.8 percent, a drop of 1.3 percentage points. Hispanic unemployment dropped 1.5 points from 10.3 percent to 8.8 percent.

White unemployment fell by one percentage point from 7 percent to 6 percent.

The unemployment rates for all three of the demographic groups has recovered much faster from the pandemic and lockdowns than it did from the recession during the Obama administration. It took until 2013 December 2013 for white unemployment to drop to 6 percent or lower. Black unemployment did not fall as low as it is now until December 2014. Hispanic unemployment hit the current level in June of 2013.

All three demographic groups still have far higher unemployment rates than before the pandemic hit. But the figures are far below the record highs hit when the economy went into lockdown last spring.

During Trump’s first term, black and Hispanic unemployment hit record lows in data stretching back decades. In the recent presidential election, Trump saw a dramatic increase in support from black and Hispanic voters, according to exit polls."
574,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/11/06/october-employment-situation/,"Better Than Expected: U.S. Economy Added 638,000 Jobs in October, Unemployment Dropped to 6.9%","The U.S. economy added 638,000 jobs in October and the unemployment rate fell to 6.9 percent, according to data released Friday.

Economists had forecast 530,000 jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate to 7.7 percent, two-tenths of a percent October’s 7.9 percent. The Labor Department had initially reported that the economy added 661,000 jobs in September.

Private-sector payrolls grew by 906,000 jobs in October, much more than expected and above October’s figure. Government employment fell by 268,000, including a 138,000 loss in jobs at the federal government. The decline in federal government workers was driven by the loss of 147,000 temporary census workers. Local government education and state government education workers also decline, by 98,000 and 61,000 respectively.

The workforce participation rate jumped to 61.7 percent from 61.4 percent in the prior month. Average hourly earnings ticked up 0.1 percent and are now 4.5 percent above the year-ago level.

Manufacturing rose by 38,000 in October but is still 621,000 below the prepandemic February level.

Construction payrolls grew 84,0000. Over the past six months, as demand for new housing has surged, construction has added 789,000 jobs. Despite the gains, payrolls remain 294,000 below February’s level.

Leisure and hospitality employment grew by 271,00 jobs, with restaurants and bars adding 192,000. Arts, entertainment, and recreation added 44,000. Hotels and motels added 34,000.

Retail trade added 104,000 jobs, with nearly one-third of the gain in electronics and appliance stores. Car dealerships and parts stores added 23,000. Furniture stores added 14,000 jobs, clothing stores added 13,000, and general merchandise stores added 10,000. Online retailers added 9,000 jobs.

Professional and business services added 208,000 jobs in October. About half of those jobs were temporary accounting assistance.

Employment in health care and social assistance rose by 79,000. But these payrolls are still down 950,000 jobs.

The economy has added around 12 million jobs in the past six months, a record-breaking pace. The increase in the ranks of employed workers shows that companies ramped up hiring as the economy reopened and consumers came back to stores, restaurants, and other businesses that had been shuttered in March and April. Despite the gains, total employment in August was lower than its February level, highlighting just how deep the pandemic cut into what had been the strongest jobs markets in decades.

Yet layoffs remain high, indicating that the pandemic’s effects are still ravaging the economy. A separate report on Thursday showed that 751,000 Americans applied for unemployment benefits in the prior week, the lowest since the pandemic struck but still higher than any week in post-World War 2 U.S. history prior to the pandemic."

During a press conference on the state of the uncalled presidential race, Trump noted that while Biden got big backing from all the nation’s largest banks, his candidacy was supported by a working-class coalition.

“At the national level, our opponents’ major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests,” Trump said. “Our donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens”:

President @realDonaldTrump: Our major donors were police officers, farmers and everyday citizens, Democrats had Wall Street bankers pic.twitter.com/T3C7FLRXnj — Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) November 5, 2020

Indeed, Trump swept with a multiracial working- and middle-class coalition of American citizens who have continued to embrace economic nationalism over Biden’s globalist record on free trade, increased foreign competition, mass immigration, and support for foreign wars.

A Bloomberg News analysis finds that Biden’s donations came from the rich and upper middle class with careers at Big Tech corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Also, Biden saw donations come in heavily from employees at big banks such as Wells Fargo, corporations such as AT&T, and universities such as Columbia University:

Meanwhile, Trump raked in cash from working- and middle-class Americans with the United States Military, the U.S. Marines, and the New York Police Department. And while Biden’s biggest donors were lawyers, university professors, doctors, engineers, scientists, Trump’s biggest donors were those on disability, homemakers, drivers, construction workers, machinists, farmers, and plumbers.

As Breitbart News reported, Biden’s donor list ahead of the November 3 election included more than 30 executives with ties to Wall Street. CNN analysis previously noted that “all the big banks” backed Biden, as Wall Street donors poured more than $74 million into his campaign.

Financial Buzz reports that Zoom, the video-conferencing app that skyrocketed in popularity at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, has added former governor of Arizona and former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to its Board of Directors as of today.

Napolitano served as the Attorney General of Arizona from 1999 to 2003 and as the 21st governor of the state from 2003 to 2009. From 2009 to 2013, Napolitano acted as the Secretary of Homeland Security. More recently, Napolitano was president of the University of California system.

Napolitano discussed her appointment to the Zoom board stating: “Zoom has immense capacity as a communication service provider. I’m excited about its future and I’m excited to join its Board.”

Zoom CEO Eric Yuan commented: “I am very pleased to welcome Secretary Napolitano to the Zoom Board of Directors. Janet has extensive leadership experience in both education and government, two key segments of Zoom customers. She also has tremendous strength of character, which she demonstrated throughout her years in public service and academia, and is adept at decision-making and leading in complex organizations. I know she will be a valuable addition to our board.”

In April of this year, Zoom admitted that some calls were routed through China. Breitbart News reported that the CEO of the video conferencing company apologized in a blog post over the various security issues that its 200 million daily users are facing on the platform. CEO Eric Yuan announced a number of measures that the company is taking to make the app more secure as millions of Americans use the app to work and study from home. Breitbart News covered the criticism of the company over its lack of action on “Zoom bombing.”

Zoom’s usage has exploded since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in January as many worldwide are forced to work or attend school from home, using the app for group meetings and online classes. In the blog post, Yuan stated that usage had increased by 1,900 percent with 200 million daily free and paying users in March up from 10 million at the end of December.

“Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year.,” the Fed said in a statement issued after the meeting.

The Fed’s hold-steady policy was widely expected even though stimulus talks collapsed on Capitol Hill, the November elections cast doubt on the idea that a new round of fiscal expansion is coming, and a surge in infections threaten to revive lockdowns and restrictions on economic activity.

The Fed not only left rates unchanged at the range of 0 to 0.25 percent set at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. The Fed statement was almost identical to the one issued at its last meeting.

“The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,” the Fed said once again.

The Fed noted that inflation remains low and that inflationary pressures are also quite low. It chalked this up to weaker demand and lower oil prices.

Fed officials are charged with maintaining both full employment and stable prices, aim for two percent inflation. In recent years, inflation has consistently run below that target. This year the Fed announced it would aim for an even higher level of inflation so that over time the average would be at the long-term target.

The Fed’s statement gives no sign that the central bank is responding to changes in the political situation or public health condition of the U.S. Hopes for near term stimulus legislation were much higher at the Fed’s last meeting but have now faded. It is unlikely that there will be any significant fiscal expansion between now and the seating of the next Congress. While the Fed could have signalled a more aggressive monetary policy in light of this, perhaps by expanding bond purchases, it chose to make no changes.

“The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals,” the Fed said."
579,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/05/munro-nyt-op-ed-shocked-stunned-to-see-blacks-vote-for-donald-trump/,"Munro: NYT Op-Ed: Shocked, Stunned to See Blacks Vote for Trump","New York Times columnist Charles Blow says he is shocked and stunned that more blacks and Latinos are breaking away from the lockstep diversity coalition to vote for President Donald Trump.

Under the headline, “Exit Polls Point to the Power of White Patriarchy,” Blow wrote November 4:

… what was shocking to me about the exit polls … [was that] A larger percentage of every racial minority voted for Trump this year than in 2016. Among Blacks and Hispanics, this percentage grew among both men and women, although men were more likely to vote for Trump than women.

Trump doubled his support among black women to eight percent and spiked his support among black men to 18, or almost one-in-five black men, according to the media coalition’s exit polls.

“I am still stunned,” said Blow.

However, Blow is likely stunned and shocked because he tries to fit the black voting numbers into his “woke” progressive view of politics. This view says the heartless engine of American politics is racial self-interest — not economic self-interest, or competition for social status, nor the self-interested push by the SAT-class for chaotic diversity and the competing desire for national solidarity by the middle class.

In his view, black men are obliged to align themselves with each other — under the guidance of their lightening-smart progressive allies at the New York Times— in a diverse coalition to collectively elevate the racial group against the eternal enemy of progressivism — the dull and degraded “whiteness” of “the White Patriarchy.”

And if that push for racial advantage were to cause a bitter pushback from un-diverse whites or Latinos, then everyone could see the racism inherent in the system, according to progressive activists.

And whatever happens, black men should not march with their fellow Americans in a color-blind national movement to force up wages or cut housing costs, for example, by barring investors (and their progressive allies) from importing more cheap workers and taxpayer-aided consumers.

But that is the zig-zag economic offer in President Donald Trump’s promise of immigration reforms — and that policy is being welcomed by most Latinos and many blue-collar blacks (and some white-collar blacks). In turn, that positive response evokes more GOP support for blacks, according to a February 2020 study:

We find that Republican elected officials have increasingly made substantive appeals to blacks on the issue of immigration reform, that exposure to this type of substantive appeal leads blacks to more strongly support a fictional Republican candidate, and that this support is moderated by a respondent’s level of linked fate.

But this conventional, time-tested, easy-to-compromise focus on economic self-interest in politics is just too much for progressive Blow to cope with.

So he suggests that blacks who align themselves with Trump’s national solidarity economic and political agenda are soiling their own blood.

All of this to me points to the power of the white patriarchy and the coattail it has of those who depend on it or aspire to it. It reaches across gender and sexual orientation and even race. Trump’s brash, privileged chest trumping and alpha-male dismissiveness and in-your-face rudeness are aspirational to some men and appealing to some women. Some people who have historically been oppressed will stand with the oppressors, and will aspire to power by proximity."

“Let me get this straight, I get the president of the United States to agree to put over half a trillion dollars of capital in the Black Community (without an endorsement) and Niggas are mad at me?” Ice Cube said in a tweet on Thursday, adding “…have a nice life.”

The movie mogul and Big Three basketball league founder unveiled his Contract with Black America earlier this year. Last month, Ice Cube said the Biden campaign told him to wait until after the election to work with them on policy aimed at black Americans. He also said the Trump campaign reached out to him, and together they “made some adjustments” to the campaign’s “Platinum Plan.”

“Trump officials reached out to Ice Cube after he posted his Contract With Black America and incorporated some of his ideas and thoughts into the Platinum Plan,” Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson told Breitbart News, confirming Ice Cube’s claims.

The Friday and Ride Along star has faced heavy backlash, mostly on social media, for his decision to work with the Trump White House. Ice Cube has refused to back down.

“Fuck you SNL,” Ice Cube tweeted over the weekend, after the long-running NBC sketch comedy show mocked him for praising President Trump’s Platinum Plan. “Trying to reduce me to greed.”

Economists had expected 7450,000 initial claims. The prior week’s claims, initially reported at 751,000, was revised up to 758,000.

The 4-week moving average fell to 787,000, a decrease of 4,000 from the previous week’s revised average. Many economists think this is a better measure of the labor market than the weekly number, which can be volatile.

Despite the decline, jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in October of 1982. In March of 2009, jobless claims peaked at 665,000.

Continuing claims, those made after the initial filing for benefits, fell to 7,285,000, a decrease of 538,000 from the previous week’s revised level. These get reported with a week’s lag so this number is for the week ended October 24.

Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of continuing claims was 6.6 million in June of 2009.

The previous week’s level was revised up 67,000 from 7,756,000 to 7,823,000. The 4-week moving average was 8,244,500, a decrease of 827,250 from the previous week’s revised average. The previous week’s average was revised up by 18,500 from 9,053,250 to 9,071,750.

Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and have made slow, if steady, progress since.

The highest insured unemployment rates in the week ending October 17 were in Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, California, and Nevada. For the country overall, the insured unemployment rate fell to 5.0. This is different from the unemployment rate the government will report on Friday because it counts only jobless claims covered by unemployment insurance, while the broader unemployment rate includes all looking for a job but out of work.

The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending October 24 were in Illinois and Michigan.

Imports from China totaled $41.2 billion in the month, according to data released by the Commerce Department Wednesday.

That’s a high level of imports but well below the pre-tariff levels and around where they stood last year. On the one hand, that suggests that we are not making much progress in reducing our reliance on Chinese goods. On the other, it suggests demand has recovered from the pandemic lows.

Exports to China totaled $11.5 billion. That’s slightly elevated and likely reflects China buying U.S. agricultural goods in compliance with the Phase One trade agreement. U.S. soy exports were up 63 percent in September.

The monthly totals are not seasonally adjusted so they should be compared with the year ago level to squeeze out any seasonality. A year ago, the September trade deficit with China came in at $31.6 billion. In fact, this year’s September figure is the lowest since 2012.

The U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world tumbled 4.7 percent in September compared with the 14 year high in August. That left a trade gap of $63.9 billion. Exports climbed 2.6 percent to $176.4 billion. Imports inched up 0.5% to $240.2 billion. Both were boosted by a high level of trade in the food and beverages category."
583,,http://www.breitbart.com/news/us-formally-exits-paris-pact-aiming-to-curb-climate-change/,US Formally Exits Paris Climate Agreement,"We’re finally out.

Just a day after the 2020 election, the United States on Wednesday formally left the Paris Agreement, a global pact it helped forge five years ago to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change.

The move, long threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump and triggered by his administration a year ago, further isolates Washington in the world but has no immediate impact on international efforts to curb global warming.

Still, the U.N. agency that oversees the treaty, France as the host of the 2015 Paris talks and three countries currently chairing the body that organizes them — Chile, Britain and Italy — issued a joint statement expressing regret at the U.S. withdrawal.

“There is no greater responsibility than protecting our planet and people from the threat of climate change,” the statement said. “The science is clear that we must urgently scale up action and work together to reduce the impacts of global warming and to ensure a greener, more resilient future for us all. The Paris Agreement provides the right framework to achieve this.”

“We remain committed to working with all U.S. stakeholders and partners around the world to accelerate climate action, and with all signatories to ensure the full implementation of the Paris Agreement,” they added.

The next planned round of U.N. climate talks takes place in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. At present, 189 countries have ratified the accord, which aims to keep the increase in average temperatures worldwide “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7 F), compared to pre-industrial levels. A further six countries have signed, but not ratified the pact.

Scientists say that any rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius could have a devastating impact on large parts of the world, raising sea levels, stoking tropical storms and worsening droughts and floods.

The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial time, so the efforts are really about preventing another 0.3 to 0.7 degrees Celsius (0.5 to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) warming from now.

“Having the U.S. pull out of Paris is likely to reduce efforts to mitigate, and therefore increase the number of people who are put into a life-or-death situation because of the impacts of climate change: this is clear from the science,” said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, a co-author of U.N. science reports on global warming.

The Paris accord requires countries to set their own voluntary targets for reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and to steadily increase those goals every few years. The only binding requirement is that nations have to accurately report on their efforts.

“The beauty of this system is that nobody can claim they were bullied into some sort of plan,” said Nigel Purvis, a former U.S. climate negotiator in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. “They’re not negotiated. They’re accepted.”

The United States is the world’s second biggest emitter after China of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and its contribution to cutting emissions is seen as important, but it’s not alone in the effort. In recent weeks, China, Japan and South Korea have joined the European Union and several other countries in setting national deadlines to stop pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than can be removed from the air with trees and other methods.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said he favors signing the U.S. back up to the Paris accord. Because it was set up as an executive agreement, not a treaty, congressional approval is not required, Purvis said.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said the accord “shackles economies and has done nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Should the U.S. continue to remain outside the pact, it’s likely that other countries will try to impose tariffs on U.S. imports — paving the way for fresh trade wars.

The European Union is currently debating a package of proposals, known as the EU New Green Deal, that would include a so-called carbon border adjustment, aimed at preventing companies from dodging emissions reduction efforts in the 27-nation bloc by manufacturing goods in places without stringent measures.

Germany, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said it was important for Europe to lead by example now that the United States had left the pact. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert noted Wednesday that the EU aims to became the first climate neutral continent by 2050.

Mahowald said she worries that with the U.S. out, China which initially agreed to emission curbs in a two-nation agreement with the Obama administrations, and other nations may decide they don’t have to do as much to cut carbon pollution.

While the Trump administration has shunned federal measures to cut emissions, Seibert noted that U.S. states, cities and businesses have pressed ahead with their own efforts.

In addition to condemnation from abroad, environmental and public health groups in the United States criticized Wednesday’s withdrawal.

CNBC reports that according to projections from NBC News, California voters have voted in favor of Prop 22, which exempts companies such as Uber and Lyft from a state labor law that would require their drivers to be classified as employees instead of independent contractors.

The proposition would allow drivers for the app-based companies to be classified as independent contractors which would not entitle them to benefits such as minimum earnings and vehicle insurance. Multiple app-based gig companies including Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and Postmates have thrown their support behind Prop 22.

The companies managed to raise almost $203 million to back the measure while opponents raised less than $20 million according to reports from Ballotpedia. In a blog post earlier this year, Uber estimated that it would have to raise rider prices by 25 percent to 111 percent in parts of California to cover costs if their workers were reclassified.

Bay Area rideshare driver Jimmy Strano said in a statement shared by Yes on 22, a committee funded by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash: “In a historic election, California drivers sent a clear message that we want to be independent, and that what’s best for us is a new approach that preserves our independence while providing new benefits.”

So why is it soaring after an election night that upended expectations, humiliated polls, and created conditions for a drawn-out fight over ballot counting that could last for weeks?

The Nasdaq Composite was up 4 percent Wednesday morning. The S&P 500 rose nearly 3 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed up 2 percent. This is a very big day for investors and a very unexpected result following such an unexpected election night.

One plausible explanation is that the market does not loathe uncertainty as much as people think. When the uncertain future has potential upside as well as downside, investors risk missing out on gains if they sit on the sidelines.

Investors may also feel better that some of the more extreme risks appear to have been ruled out. Regardless of who occupies the White House next year, this was not a blue wave election. The Senate will remain in Republican control, denying Democrats an opportunity to pursue destabilizing projects such as creating new states or expanding the Supreme Court. The Republican Senate is also likely to block tax hikes or ambitious Green New Deal-type climate legislation.

A divided government may also be less likely to enact measures to rein in or break up powerful social media companies. That could explain why the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared on Wednesday and why Communications Services is the second-best performing sector of the S&P 500.

The best performing S&P sector is health care. That too may be a relief trade. A divided government will not likely upend current health care policies, leaving the Obamacare-fattened profits of drug-makers, clinical chains, and hospitals in place.

While many on Wall Street looked at a Blue Wave as likely to lead to fiscal expansion, it is possible that a divided government will still manage to get a stimulus bill passed. It likely will not be as large as what an all-Democrat government would have passed and it may have to wait until the economy shows signs of weakness. But with the election behind us, perhaps lawmakers will be eventually willing to break bread with each other once more.

Finally, in the absence of a resolution of political questions, investors may be focused of fundamentals. Manufacturing is recovering at a faster pace than expected. The housing market is booming. Exports are rising. The economy is a lot like Donald Trump in Pennsylvania—not yet out of the woods, but much stronger than the experts predicted."

Nasdaq 100 stock futures soared fast enough that they tripped a trading halt kicks in at a sudden 3.5 percent rise. As of about 11:30 p.m. the Nasdaq futures were up 3.2 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures were initially trading lower as results came in but turned around as it became clear that Trump was likely to win in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, all states where Trump was behind in the polls. A half-hour before midnight, Dow futures were up 0.64 percent and S&P futures were up 1.4 percent.

Treasury yields were volatile. At one point, yield on the benchmark ten-year Treasury rose above 0.9 percent and then fell below eight-tenths of a percent. By 11:30 p.m., they were at 0.827 percent, a slight decline. A falling yield indicates a rising price for bonds.

The dollar initially slumped and then advanced the most since June. It rose in value against the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the Euro, and the U.K. pound.

A tough-on-China approach has been a key element of Trump’s policy platform. In the first term of his administration, he imposed tariffs on the Communist-run country.

As Breitbart News’ John Carney reported earlier this week, Trump made good on his promise to curb bad trade deals with China:

In the summer of 2017, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced an investigation into China’s policies that might be hampering U.S. property rights, innovation, or technology development.

The devastating report found China was stealing U.S. technology by forcing U.S. companies to handover tech to Chinese-controlled joint-ventures. The Trump administration responded with a $50 billion list of 1,333 Chinese products on which it intended to impose 25 percent tariffs.

After China published its own list of U.S. products—from cars, to aircraft, to agricultural goods—that it would subject to forthcoming 25 percent tariffs as retaliation, Trump told Lighthizer to put a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of additional goods.

In the summer of 2018, U.S. imposed the 25 percent tariff on the first list of $50 billion of goods. Trump threatens to impose tariffs on all US imports from China, which totaled $504 billion in 2017.

By September 2018, the 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products take effect.

Trump declared a trade truce in December 2018, but said if talks did not produce an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs would rise to 25 percent.

China and the U.S. spent much of 2019 in stop and start negotiations. In May, the U.S. raised the 10 percent tariff to 25 percent and then makes plans to raise tariffs on all remaining Chinese goods.

The currency’s nosedive continued as more election results came in across the U.S.

“Compared with the pandemic and the economy, relatively few voters — about 1 in 10 — deemed racism or law enforcement the country’s top issue,” said an Associated Press report about the exit poll it ran with a broad group of other media outlets. “Even fewer, 4%, called law enforcement most important,” AP added.

A second exit poll said, “racial equality was the top issue for roughly 21 percent of voters,” according to CNN:

About one-third called the economy their most critical issue, while roughly 1 in 5 citing racial inequality and about 1 in 6 named the coronavirus pandemic as most important to their vote. Roughly 1 in 10 each cited health care policy and crime and violence as their top issue.

The cause for the different responses to the CNN and AP poll questions is unclear.

CNN described its exit poll:

CNN Exit Polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and telephone polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters, and were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 115 polling locations nationwide among 7,774 Election Day voters. The results also include 4,919 interviews with early and absentee voters conducted by phone. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

AP described how it did its exit poll:"
589,2020-11-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/03/economy-is-by-far-americas-top-issue-cnn-exit-poll-shows/,"Economy Is By Far America’s Top Issue, CNN Exit Poll Shows","A plurality of Americans say that the economy is the top issue for their vote, according to a CNN exit poll released Tuesday night.

CNN said that 34 percent of voters named the economy as their top issue.

Racial inequality was a distant second with 21 percent. Coronvirus was third, with 18 percent. “Crime and Safety” and “Health Care Policy” each garnered 11 percent.

Trump wins high marks from Americans for his handling of the economy. In the latest Gallup poll, Trump had a 54 percent approval rating on the economy. Over the summer, this had slipped below 50 percent as the economy staggered in the wake of the lockdowns. But it has now returned to the high level he has enjoyed for most of his presidency.

When asked what is more important, rebuilding the economy or containing the virus, people say containing the virus by a margin of 52 percent to 42 percent.

The CNN exit poll is consistent with a Gallup poll released last month in which Americans said the economy was the number one issue."

Gavin Newsom’s exercise of emergency powers, including a vote-by-mail decree earlier this year, violated the constitutional separation of powers, though the decision will not affect the November election.

Judge Sarah H. Heckman ruled that while California’s emergency law, the California Emergency Services Act, was constitutional, Newsom’s orders were not because they rewrote statutory law, which only the legislature can do.

Two Republicans, State Assemblymen Kevin Kiley (R-Yuba City) and James Gallagher (R-Rocklin), challenged Newsom’s executive order earlier in the year establishing new vote-by-mail rules. They contended that the governor had usurped state law.

Though the state legislature — in which Democrats have supermajorities in both houses — later largely codified Newsom’s order, the judge held that the case was not moot because Newsom had continued to issue broad, sweeping executive orders.

As such, she issued an injunction preventing Newsom from issuing further executive orders under the emergency law.

Kiley and Gallagher were exuberant, even though the court’s decision did not affect the election process, because the order, if upheld, would end the shutdowns that have become increasingly unpopular in many parts of the Golden State (and are being at least partially ignored in many instances).

The Judge has ruled in our case against Gavin Newsom. We won. The Judge found good cause to issue a permanent injunction restraining the Governor from issuing further unconstitutional orders. — Kevin Kiley (@KevinKileyCA) November 2, 2020

The heart of our lawsuit should be well received by Reps & Dems in the #CALeg 👉 ""The Governor does not have the power or authority to assume the Legislature's role of creating legislative policy and enactments."" — James Gallagher (@J_GallagherAD3) November 3, 2020

The accumulation of power in one man is not good for our civil liberties or the separation of powers provided in the Constitution. — James Gallagher (@J_GallagherAD3) November 3, 2020

The governor’s office reportedly disagrees with the ruling. It has ten days to respond before the court order is final.

The Dow climbed by more than 680 points, or around 2.5 percent Tuesday morning, before retreating from their highs.

With two hours of trading left, the Dow rose 552 points or 2.05 percent. The Nasdaq Composite clmbed 1.85 percent. The S&P 500 is also up 1.8 percent. The small-cap Russell 2000 is up 2.91 percent, which looks a lot like a bet on stimulus legislation.

Ten of the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were up. The Energy sector was down 0.75 percent. Industrials was the best performing sector, rising 2.9 percent, led by the road and rail subsector and the shipping subsector. Maybe it is finally infrastructure week.

The Financials sector was the second-best performing, up 2.3 percent for the day, lead higher by the bank component’s 2.7 percent gain and the consumer finance subsector’s 2.9 percent gain. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks the stocks of the biggest banks, rose 2.7 percent.

Donald Trump’s victory for 2016 set off an explosive rally in stocks, defying widespread predictions that he would lose or that if he won it would cause the market to crash. Financials were the best performing sector on the day after election day.

Many of the big Wall Street firms have Joe Biden as the runaway favorite to win the presidency, just as they had Hillary Clinton the favorite four years ago. Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Tuesday that they estimate a 76 percent chance that Biden wins and the Democrats take control of the Senate. They estimate just an eight percent chance that Trump wins and GOP holds the Senate. The Wall Street firm gives just a thirteen percent chance of a mixed result with Biden winning but the GOP holding the Senate.

Biden has raised tens of millions of dollars from Wall Street. During his time as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, Biden earned the nickname “Plastic Joe” for his willingness to promote legislation friendly to credit card issuers, including a law that made it harder for bankrupt customers to get debt relief.

Most analysts think the economy and the stock market could get a big boost if Democrats sweep the election. A unified government would be more likely to quickly pass a stimulus bill, likely giving stocks a short-term boost and ameliorating the drag from new restrictions aimed at stemming the pandemic’s surge.

Biden’s immigration and visa programs would likely import enough workers to ease wage pressure, boosting corporate profits by lowering compensation costs. An increase in foreign workers also generates new customers for U.S. companies, especially U.S. banks and large retailers. Biden is viewed as likely to lift tariffs on China, allowing U.S. companies to send more jobs to cheaper overseas labor markets.

Biden has promised a rush of higher taxes and new regulations, including climate change schemes that would make energy more costly and damage U.S. manufacturing.

Note that not everyone on Wall Street is convinced of a Trump victory. Based on anecdotal evidence and no hard data, quant traders, in particular, appear to be skeptical that Biden will win."

“In … analysis, not from some liberal think tank, but by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create seven million more jobs and a trillion dollars in more economic growth than anything the president has proposed,” Biden said.

Later, Biden claimed President Donald Trump is the voice of Wall Street and Park Avenue billionaires. In actuality, Biden has raked in more than $74 million from Wall Street and eight times the cash from Park Avenue’s elite than what they have given Trump.

“Folks, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, from Wall Street. That’s all he can see. Well, I see it from Scranton where I grew up,” Biden said. “I see it from Pennsylvania and Delaware.”

Moody’s Analytics issued the report backing a blue wave on November 3, arguing that, with a Biden administration, there will be a return to more immigration and more free trade that will boost the financial industry’s efforts for higher GDP.

Biden’s big money donor list, revealed this week, showed that more than 30 executives with ties to Wall Street have contributed huge amounts of cash to his campaign.

A CNN analysis last month admitted that “all the big banks are backing Biden” against Trump as donations pour in from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley.

Carlson deemed it “election tampering” and cited Breitbart News’ lack of search results on Google to back up his claim.

The Fox News host noted the well-documented claim of Google’s handling of Breitbart News following a May 2020 so-called algorithm update.

Partial transcript as follows:

CARLSON: One of the first things that we should be honest about is one of the worst forms of election tampering took place far from polling sites. It wasn’t votes from dead people. Those are bad, but they weren’t the worst thing. The worst things are more obvious than that.

The worst thing was Silicon Valley.

The tech monopolies spent the final weeks of the presidential election suppressing the voices of Trump supporter’s and hiding damaging information about his opponent Joe Biden. That happened. We saw it firsthand. We experienced it. You may have, too.

In August, Facebook banned the pro-Trump super PAC committee To Defend the President from buying any campaign advertising. What? What election has that happened in? None.

Just a few weeks ago, as you well know, The New York Post published true and accurate details of the Biden family’s lucrative and damaging overseas influence-peddling operation, which was real, which Joe Biden knew about.

Facebook, in turn, limited the distribution of this article, and Twitter blocked people from posting it. In other words, they censored it. They kept people from knowing about it, and on what basis? Nothing in those articles was untrue, but they censored it anyway, along with any content that was critical of lockdowns and mandatory mask-wearing. Why? Because Biden supported those.

There are many threads to this. There is overwhelming evidence this happens — we’ll just pick one piece, a report from Breitbart.

They took a lot of time to look into what Google was doing to them. They found that Google suppressed its stories about Joe Biden in the middle of 2020 through Election Day, suppressed them.

Quote, “Clicks and impressions to Breitbart News from ‘Joe Biden’ Google searches displayed a healthy pattern of activity in the middle of 2020 when they suddenly flatlined … the plunge first occurred after a major update to Google’s search algorithm in May 2020.”

Ask anybody in digital news, do searches for the names of candidates decline as we get closer to the election? No, probably not. In fact, they accelerate, but not if Google is censoring you, which is what they were doing.

None of this is normal. It doesn’t matter how often or how emphatically CNN encourages it, tells you it’s fine, tells you it is necessary to suppress disinformation, is totally wrong, and it’s crazy.

Democracy cannot survive tampering like that. The Biden campaign knows exactly what happened. They know exactly the degree to which they benefited from it, and that’s why they are rewarding their co-conspirators in Big Tech with even more power.

Biden apparently has already hired Jessica Hertz, that’s Facebook’s former associate general counsel, as well as Cynthia Hogan, the former Apple vice president for government affairs. Oh, kind of an inside game. Yeah.

Reportedly Biden is also considering naming Eric Schmidt, the former top executive in Google and a big Biden donor to his technology industry task force in the White House. This is not a matter of rewarding your supporters. It’s much bigger than that, and it’s of deep concern to every American.

If we are going to have real and fair elections going forward, then we have to end Silicon Valley’s total control of information. It’s the first thing we must do. We can’t have free and fair elections without that. If voters aren’t allowed to learn critical facts about political candidates before they vote, you can’t have a democracy.

And of course, that’s why they are doing it."

“We removed 12 Facebook accounts, two Pages and 307 Instagram accounts linked to individuals associated with EITRC, a Tehran-based IT company. This activity originated in Iran and targeted primarily Israel, and also Iraq,” the social media giant said in its October 2020 Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Report.

Most of the accounts went through significant name changes and claimed to be either from Israel or Iraq. They posted memes, images and other content in Hebrew and Arabic focusing on news and current events in the countries they targeted, including the anti-Netanyahu protests in Israel, criticism of his policies and response to the pandemic, Facebook said.

Facebook said the network was early in its audience building when it was removed, but had nevertheless garnered around 10,000 followers.

One of the accounts was called “Black flags II” after the Black Flags protest movement that has organized anti-Netanyahu protests around the country for several months.

Just days after a similar move by Facebook, Twitter has said it will remove all posts that deny the Holocaust — which the platform says violates its policy against spreading hateful content. https://t.co/WllPyuWhyN — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 16, 2020

Facebook also said it removed another network originating in Iran that focused primarily on the United States and Israel.

“They focused on Saudi Arabia’s activities in the Middle East and claims about an alleged massacre at Eurovision, an international song contest, hosted by Israel in 2019,” Facebook said.

Iran was also blamed last month for emails sent to American voters, claiming to be from far-right group the Proud Boys and intimidating them into voting for U.S. President Donald Trump on “or we will come after you.”

Netanyahu’s Likud Party responded to Facebook’s report, saying that Iran “secretly worked to fuel the left-wing ‘Black Flag’ demonstrations in Israel attempting to overthrow” the prime minister.

“Iran, which seeks Israel’s destruction, works to acquire nuclear weapons and arms enemies around us, is investing in efforts to overthrow Prime Minister Netanyahu because Tehran knows that Netanyahu has been one of the main global forces blocking these attempts for years,” the statement said.

“Even if the left-wing demonstrators replace their black flags with pink flags they will not be able to obscure the fact that they are being supported by one of the darkest regimes in the world and both have a common goal — to bring down the prime minister,” it added."

Twitter blacklisted the accounts for Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza as well as three accounts that represent Angel Families — including the Angel Families organization and the Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime (AVIAC).

Mendoza, whose son Brandon Mendoza was killed by an illegal alien in 2014, told Breitbart News that her Twitter account was suspended without any explanation as to why. Likewise, her accounts for her Angel Families organization were suspended as well.

Angel Mom Sabine Durden, whose 30-year-old son Dominic was killed by an illegal alien in 2012, told Breitbart News that the Twitter account for AVIAC was suspended with an explanation. Durden said the AVIAC account had not changed any of its usual post sharing practices when the suspension occurred.

Last year, Twitter suspended Mary Ann Mendoza’s account because of her posts raising awareness of the dangers of illegal immigration. Mendoza was forced to delete the posts in question in order to have her account reinstated.

A Twitter spokesperson told Breitbart News that the accounts “were suspended for violating our platform manipulation and spam policy.” The spokesperson did not provide specific posts that violated the policy.

Rand Paul’s (R-KY) post about historical voter fraud by claiming the information is either “disputed” or “misleading.” After it was pointed out that Paul was quoting directly from the biography of Kentucky democrat Ed Pritchard, the platform removed its censorship.

As President Donald Trump and other Republicans charge that there remains voter fraud across battleground states such as Pennsylvania during the 2020 presidential election, Paul noted that America had experienced voter fraud in the past.

“KY Dem Ed Pritchard was convicted of voter fraud in 1949 for fraudulently casting 254 votes,” Paul wrote. “His biographer said: ‘the untidy truth was that widespread vote fraud was America’s dirty little secret . . .’ Elections with millions of mail ballots makes fraud more likely not less.”

The Kentucky conservative noted that it was difficult to affect an election via fraud because very few Americans voted by absentee voting.

“The history of voter fraud in absentee voting is long, but it was usually difficult to affect an election because less than 1% voted absentee. Policing postmarks, signatures, and fraud is now overwhelming because half the electorate votes by mail,” he added.

However, after Paul wrote his tweet, it appears that Twitter censored Paul’s message by claiming that the information is “disputed” or might be “misleading.”

Twitter is censoring this tweet, which is 100 percent a statement of fact pic.twitter.com/yul8TW3MJO — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) November 6, 2020

Despite Twitter’s contention that the information was misleading or disputed, Paul quoted the information straight from the biography of Edward Prichard.

Now, it appears that Twitter removed the “misleading” or “disputed” label for Paul’s message.

Twitter’s censorship of Paul arises as the social media giant has censored President Donald Trump six times over the last 24 hours.

Breitbart News’ Lucas Nolan wrote:

Just yesterday Breitbart News reported that of President Trump’s 22 posts on Facebook and Twitter, 11 were censored by the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe. Now, Jack Dorsey’s company has censored a further six tweets by the President, dramatically lowering their engagement.

The New York Times wrote that Twitter’s censorship severely diminished the reach of the president’s tweets.

The Times wrote , “Before Mr. Trump’s tweet was labeled, it was shared or replied to about 827 times a minute. After it was labeled, that dropped to 151 times a minute, according to the E.I.P. analysis.”

The “oversight board” a semi-independent body the social network created earlier this year that allegedly has the power to decide whether content banned by Facebook stays banned or is restored on appeal.

“With #Trump’s fall, the wave of hate and intolerance will end not only in #America but also across the world. USA is moving towards ending one of the fiercest waves of hate in modern history” said oversight board member Tawakkol Karman.

Karman, who Facebook has appointed to rule on content moderation appeals, is a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood according to a report by Newsbusters:

Four of the board’s members are connected with liberal billionaire mega donor George Soros, giving him more influence on the board than the entire conservative movement. The board’s most radical member, for example, is Tawakkol Karman, a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. She announced in a June 7 tweet amidst international destructive protests that she is “standing with the revolutions!” The Muslim Brotherhood has a violent reputation, including its Hamas division, the terrorist organization that attacks Israel. The Facebook Oversight Board announced Karman as a member on May 6 and has been heavily criticized for it.

The purportedly neutral oversight board, aimed at lending legitimacy to Facebook’s censorship, is packed with left-wing, anti-Trump figures, as Breitbart News previously reported.

These include a former Social Democrat prime minister of Denmark, the former editor-in-chief of the left-wing Guardian newspaper in Britain, and someone who once compared Trump to Hitler.

Other universities, including Rutgers, Wesleyan, NYU, and the University of Michigan already offer a minor in Caribbean Studies. Cornell’s Africana Studies department chair Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò argues there is no “intellectual justification” to create a Caribbean Studies minor.

According to a report by the College Fix, Cornell University officials have rejected a proposal that would have established a “Caribbean Studies” minor course of study. The proposal was inspired by similar programs that already exist at other universities and colleges around the country.

The proposal was knocked down by Cornell’s Africana Studies and Research Center department chair Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò. He argued that students can concentrate their studies in Caribbean Studies by simply selecting courses that focus on the topic.

In a statement, Professor Táíwò said that there was not a sufficient “intellectual justification” to establish a dedicated minor in Caribbean Studies. “We would need an intellectual justification for splitting the framework and undermining our primary goal of ensuring that our graduates do not think each of its components in isolation from the others even as, as we point out below, we make a point of providing for specialization or concentration on those component parts in our current curricular framework,” he wrote in the statement.

“A close look at our curriculum will show that we already have ample provisions for those of your members who might want to concentrate on the Caribbean region in our extant Minor,” Táíwò added. “Equally important is the fact that we regularly offer classes that focus on the region, especially the ‘Introduction to Caribbean Studies’ class which, I might point out, is almost unique in the Department.”

Aurora McKenzie, the co-founder of Cornell’s Caribbean Student Association, said that they were shocked by the department’s refusal to support their efforts to establish a minor course of studies in Caribbean Studies.

“It has shocked a lot of the students,” McKenzie said. “Even though we knew that not every department on campus would respond, or even support, not getting support from Africana was definitely something crazy.”

According to the Times, the social media companies added “friction” to their interfaces leading up to the election, “as if Ferrari had realized that it could only stop its cars from crashing by replacing the engines with go-kart motors.”

In an article titled “On Election Day, Facebook and Twitter Did Better by Making Their Products Worse,” the New York Times praises efforts by social media giants to censor President Trump and his supporters during the U.S. Presidential election. As the Times points out, social media platforms did the opposite of what turned them into the Masters of the Universe, throttling engagement, adding “friction” to the user experience, and doing everything possible to convince users to engage with posts less often.

The Times writes:

Nowhere was this shift more apparent than at Facebook, which for years envisioned itself as a kind of post-human communication platform. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, often spoke about his philosophy of “frictionless” design — making things as easy as possible for users. Other executives I talked to seemed to believe that ultimately, Facebook would become a kind of self-policing machine, with artificial intelligence doing most of the dirty work and humans intervening as little as possible. But in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Facebook went in the opposite direction. It put in place a new, cumbersome approval process for political advertisers, and blocked new political ads in the period after Election Day. It throttled false claims, and put in place a “virality circuit-breaker” to give fact-checkers time to evaluate suspicious stories. And it temporarily shut off its recommendation algorithm for certain types of private groups, to lessen the possibility of violent unrest. (On Thursday, The New York Times reported that the company was taking other temporary measures to tamp down election-related misinformation, including adding more friction to the process of sharing posts.) All of these changes may, in fact, make Facebook safer. But they also involve dialing back the very features that have powered the platform’s growth for years. It’s a telling act of self-awareness, as if Ferrari had realized that it could only stop its cars from crashing by replacing the engines with go-kart motors.

Eli Pariser, who is trying to reimagine social media as a public space called Civic Signals, commented: “If you look at Facebook’s election response, it was essentially to point a lot of traffic and attention to these hubs that were curated by people. That’s an indication that ultimately, when you have information that’s really important, there’s no substitute for human judgment.”

Breitbart News recently reported that 11 of President Trump’s 22 posts on Facebook and Twitter have been censored by the Silicon Valley tech firms. The posts include the President’s claims to victory and assertions of election fraud taking place. Twitter hid some posts on the President’s timeline and warned users that “some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process,” and restricted users’ ability to like or retweet the tweets.

Underneath some of President Trump’s Facebook posts, the social media company warned users that “final votes may different from the initial vote counts” or “elections officials follow strict rules when it comes to ballot counting, handling and reporting,” but users were still able to reply to and share the posts.

Forbes reports that Facebook has announced that it plans to demote content “our systems predict may be misinformation” relating to election fraud. A Facebook spokesperson told Forbes that the social media company is “seeing more reports of inaccurate claims about the election” and “while many of these claims have low engagement on our platform, we are taking additional temporary steps.”

The spokesperson told Forbes that Facebook would be taking a number of actions including “demotions for content on Facebook and Instagram that our systems predict may be misinformation, including debunked claims about voting” and “limiting the distribution of Live videos that may relate to the election on Facebook.”

On Thursday, Facebook blacklisted a grassroots group called “Stop the Steal,” deleting the group after it had gained more than 300,000 members.

Facebook has made efforts to censor its platform closely during the election cycle. Of 22 posts across social media by President Trump, 11 have been labeled as “misleading” by Twitter and Facebook. The posts include the President’s claims to victory and assertions of election fraud taking place. Twitter hid some posts on the President’s timeline and warned users that “some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process,” and restricted users’ ability to like or retweet the tweets.

Over the course of the past day, the following tweets from the President have been censored:

According to a New York Times’ report relating to Twitter’s censorship of the President on the election night, “Before Mr. Trump’s tweet was labeled, it was shared or replied to about 827 times a minute. After it was labeled, that dropped to 151 times a minute, according to the E.I.P. analysis.”

So too is a Democrat lawmaker, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), as Breitbart News reported yesterday.

Via the Hill:

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the watchdog group Common Cause issued a joint request Thursday for Twitter to temporarily suspend President Trump’s account over the spread of disinformation about the election. The groups sent a joint letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey calling for Trump’s account to be suspended over “repeated violations” of the platform’s Civic Integrity Policy. “We fear that, in the absence of action by Twitter, the President may be successful in his goal of delegitimizing the integrity of our democratic processes for many, and not just Twitter users but other voters and members of the public, sowing uncertainty about the voting and elections process, and potentially inciting violence against civil servants or others,” Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn and Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law executive director Kirsten Clarke wrote.

As votes continue to be counted, Big Tech’s censorship of the president has reached unprecedented levels. As of yesterday, half of President Trump’s posts on Facebook and Twitter had been flagged for “misinformation.”

Twitter’s election-night censorship limited engagement (such as retweets) on the President’s tweets by over 80 percent, according to one analysis.

My name is Brian Mcafferty, I’m a registered Democrat in the city of Philadelphia. Today, I am at the Philadelphia convention center, and I am overseeing the ballot counters. I will let you know, the corruption going on here … they will not allow us within 30 to 100 feet to supervise the ballots being counted. This is a coup against the President of the United States of America, and I want to call out the Mayor of Philadelphia, James Kenney, the Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who tweeted that there’s no way Donald Trump can win the Presidency of the United States of America, and also district attorney Larry Krasner. I can’t believe what I’m seeing right before my eyes. This has nothing to do with Joe Biden or Donald Trump. This has to do with democracy and I will tell you there is corruption at the highest level in the city of Philadelphia.

The frustrating thing about these claims is that there is usually no way to verify them — partly because the people accused of fraud are often the same people who would have to investigate it.

Democrats claimed “Russian interference” in 2016, though there turned out to be no actual “collusion,” and the actual effect of (small) Russian troll farms and alleged email hackers was difficult to determine.

The sad reality is that there are already legal ways for partisan actors to interfere with the election.

By far, the biggest factor in the 2020 presidential election seems to have been vote-by-mail, which is linked to six of the seven methods below.

Democrats pioneered the use of vote-by-mail to turn out their own voters in a judicial election in Wisconsin in April, then went on what that New York Times called a “a virtual nationwide tour, extolling the virtues” of the system. They planned lawsuits and pressure campaigns to force key battleground states to adopt the new voting system.

(A key figure in that effort, attorney Marc Elias, is also the operative who funded the “Russia dossier.”)

Republicans prefer to vote in person, especially because of the secret ballot, which vote-by-mail compromises.

In a time of “cancel culture” and rioting, it is easy to understand why Republicans prefer to show up in person, coronavirus or not.

Vote-by-mail also put President Donald Trump in an impossible position. He predicted that Democrats would use the system to do exactly what they did — to turn out their vote and put the outcome in doubt.

The danger, however, of criticizing vote-by-mail was that Trump risked suppressing his own turnout, particularly among seniors afraid of voting in person. So he had to encourage people to use it anyway.

And when he complained about the system, he was fact-checked by media and censored by social media companies.

Here are seven ways the vote is tilted.

1. Voter fraud.

Actual voter fraud, though relatively small in scale, includes voting twice; dead people voting*; filing out ballots for other people; “losing” ballots before they are counted; and so on. An unnamed political insider explained to the New York Post before the election how he once did it, and trained others to do it, with mail-in ballots. “An election that is swayed by 500 votes, 1,000 votes — it can make a difference,” he told the Post. “It could be enough to flip states.”

2. Ballot harvesting.

Ballot harvesting involves using third parties to collect an unlimited number mail-in ballots from other people. It has been legal in California since 2016, and Democrats used it effectively in 2018, delivering hundreds of thousands of ballots that way. (Republicans have tried, and failed, to copy them; GOP voters don’t part easily with their ballots.) Democrats want to legalize ballot harvesting nationwide. In several states, Democrats sued to let it happen; in Michigan, it was allowed briefly.

3. “Curing” absentee ballots.

Several states — including Republican-governed states — allow voters to “cure” problems with absentee ballots — such as a missing signature — then re-submit them. Democrats are literally going door-to-door right now in closely-contested Georgia, asking “absentee” voters, in person, to “fix” their ballots. Democrats also sued in Arizona for a list of names of voters whose ballots needed “curing,” probably so they could focus on likely Democratic voters. They lost, but that is their strategy.

4. Deadline extensions, relaxed rules.

Democrats sued in several key battleground states to force states to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots to be counted past Election Day itself. They won in several states; they lost in several states. In North Carolina, they reached a deal with the Democrats who run the state’s election board. In Pennsylvania, the U.S. Supreme Court split 4-4 (before Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation), allowing the state’s new rules to stand.

5. Privately funded get-out-the-vote efforts.

As Breitbart News warned in October, liberal billionaires like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated hundreds of millions of dollars to so-called “safe elections” efforts. Ostensibly nonpartisan, these appear to have functioned as get-out-the-vote operations for Democrats, targeting key cities and states.

6. Automatic vote-by-mail applications.

Some states, like California, decided to send vote-by-mail applications to every registered voter in the state, whether it was constitutional or not. The most striking thing about some of these efforts is that they were federally funded. The CARES Act, for example — the first coronavirus relief package — paid for states like Wisconsin to send information packets to millions of registered voters — in effect, a federally-funded voter turnout operation.

7. Social media censorship.

The decision of Silicon Valley companies to censor information during the election had a profound effect whose true impact may never be fully known. Twitter regularly censored the president, and the New York Post‘s reporting on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. Google suppressed search results for Breitbart News. Now they slap “nutrition labels” on articles about voter fraud. This is a form of election interference that will likely continue.

The page was set up only recently, and quickly grew to over 300,000 members in the space of 24 hours, as voter concerns about irregular activities at voting locations in key swing states escalated. Stop the Steal is also organizing through its own website.

In October, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg donated over $100 million to a “safe elections” project run by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.

But now, it seems ordinary Republican voters are not allowed to use his platform to organize in defense of election integrity.

The mainstream media ran several articles about Stop the Steal, attacking its members as purveyors of “misinformation” and criticizing Facebook for not censoring the page quickly enough.

One journalist even claimed, bizarrely, that allowing Republican voters to use Facebook to organize rallies in defense of fair elections would somehow lead to violence.

“Facebook is, once again, doing an absolutely atrocious job at curtailing election-related disinformation and violent rhetoric,” said Rolling Stone reporter EJ Dickson on Twitter

“Its history of being reactive rather than proactive may very well result in the platform having blood on its hands.”

The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British-based NGO that pressures social media companies to censor conservatives, also demanded that Facebook take the page down.

In a comment to the media, a Facebook spokesman accused the group of trying to “delegitimize” the election process, and said some members of the group “called for violence,” without citing any explaining why the page was being held collectively responsible for the posts of such individuals.

“In line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group ‘Stop the Steal,’ which was creating real-world events,” said the Facebook representative.

“The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.”

Members of the Boise State University student government argued that keeping the coffee vendor on campus would send a “poor message” to black students.

According to a report by the College Fix, a coffee vendor was forced to leave its post at Boise State University after students uncovered the vendor’s work with organizations that support local police forces.

Sarah Fendley, the owner of Big City Coffee, began working with police non-profits after her former police officer partner was shot and paralyzed during an altercation with an escaped prisoner.

After students discovered Fendley’s relationship with police non-profit organizations, they immediately began to call on the university to cut ties with her business. During a student government meeting, one student argued Fendley’s business could make the campus a “dangerous place.”

We are supporting an organization that blatantly supports the Thin Blue Line and every Black person I know has stories of being treated unfairly at this place. I believe that they should have never been brought to campus and if it can be reversed it should be. Not reversing it sends a statement across campus. There should be more marginalized student voices on this. You need to find a way to cancel this contract because every marginalized student knows about this affiliation and that it is a dangerous place.

Due to mounting pressure, Fendley ultimately decided to leave campus. In a Facebook post, Fendley pushed back against the students and explained why she finds it important to support organizations like the Thin Blue Line.

“…if you want to know why I support first responders ask me … I’ll tell you and if your lucky you might get to meet my hero,” Fendley wrote. “He has extensive nerve damage and debilitating pain but he manages to smile through most of it and I love him. He never hesitated that day and he would do it again. We are lucky to have such great police, fire and EMS in our community. I support them because they support us.”

David Cicilline (D-RI) called Wednesday for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump’s account for posting what he claimed were “lies and misinformation.”

“Right now, the President’s Twitter account is posting lies and misinformation at a breathtaking clip. It is a threat to our democracy and should be suspended until all the votes are counted,” he said in a pinned tweet.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) also urged the tech giant to suspend the president’s account, writing, “This is America, not Russia”:

In addition to the president’s account, Twitter targeted conservative journalists and commentators on Wednesday as concern over the election results grew, according to Breitbart News.

Radio host Buck Sexton said Twitter was “currently blocking a tweet of mine that expresses concern about *possible future* voter fraud that could be happening in the days ahead.”

Twitter currently blocking a tweet of mine that expresses concern about *possible future* voter fraud that could be happening in the days ahead- Big tech basically works for the DNC. This is appalling. — Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) November 4, 2020

“Big tech basically works for the DNC. This is appalling,” he noted.

In a recent letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chad Wolf demanded that the company stop censoring government officials’ accounts, according to Breitbart News.

“This follows Twitter’s decision to suspend the account of Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, after he posted a tweet praising President Trump’s border wall,” the article stated.

Wolf’s letter read, in part:

There was no reason to remove Mr. Morgan’s tweet from your platform, other than ideological disagreement with the speaker. Such censorship is disturbing. Twitter’s conduct censoring U.S. government officials also endangers the national security. It is dangerous and damaging when any publisher arbitrarily and unfoundedly decides, as it did here, that the facts and policies of a particular Presidential Administration constitute “violence”—in order to censor them. And in the case of Twitter, this can cut off an essential mode of communication between U.S. Government officials and the public. In doing so, Twitter is sabotaging public discourse regarding important national and homeland security issues.

“Further, it is clear that Twitter’s gross censorship was intentional, not accidental,” the secretary wrote."

According to a report by the College Fix, the University of Virginia held a guided meditation event on Wednesday to help students cope with emotions that have been stirred by the election. Each meditation session was followed by a “reflective discussion” between students and staff on the election.

The meditation event, which was led by members of the religious studies department, was intended to help students better understand how the election has impacted their mental health.

The four-hour time frame will be punctuated by a brief guided meditation or contemplative practice on each hour and half-hour mark. Following each guided practice will be approximately 20-25 minutes of open reflection facilitated by CSC staff and supported by Religious Studies faculty. Students will have a chance to reflect on how they are experiencing this historic moment emotionally and physically in a respectful environment. Emphasis will be placed on learning to bring open awareness to one’s experience during times of uncertainty.

The University of Virginia is just one of many universities offering specialized support to students following the election. Bowling Green University held an event during which students were encouraged to shred their feelings with a paper shredder. Alma College in Michigan held an event where students with “election fatigue” were permitted to paint and make bracelets.

Breitbart News reported this week that the University of Michigan offered specialized counseling services to students that were struggling with anxiety as a result of the election. A student newspaper revealed, however, that students have to wait approximately one month for an appointment with a campus therapist.

China denounces US sanctions over Hong Kong crackdownThe Associated PressBEIJING

BEIJING (AP) — China on Tuesday denounced new U.S. sanctions against four Chinese officials over a crackdown on political rights in Hong Kong, saying such moves “grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs.”

The U.S. State Department said Monday the four would be banned from traveling to the U.S. and would have any assets in the country blocked, calling it a response for their roles in implementing Hong Kong’s national security law, seen as heavily restricting free speech and opposition politics since its passage in June.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the move a violation of the “basic norms governing international relations” and urged the U.S. to withdraw the sanctions.

“The relevant U.S. behaviors blatantly meddle in Hong Kong affairs and grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.

The U.S. has already imposed such sanctions on a number of officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. Washington accuses Beijing of betraying a promise to allow the former British colony to retain its own civil liberties for 50 years after its handover to Chinese rule in 1997.

“These actions underscore U.S. resolve to hold accountable key figures that are actively eviscerating the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,” the State Department said in its statement.

The four officials are Li Jiangzhou, the deputy director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security, established after the law was passed; head of the police National Security Division Edwina Law; police Senior Supt. Steve Li Kwai-Wah; and deputy director of the central government’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Deng Zhonghua.

Monday’s announcement came as Hong Kong’s 19 pro-democracy lawmakers said they would resign en masse from the city’s legislative council if Beijing disqualifies any of them.

Unconfirmed reports have said that China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee was preparing to disqualify four legislators at a meeting this week, accusing them of filibustering meetings and violating their oaths of office.

Along with sanctioning officials, the U.S. has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, prompting other countries to follow suit.

During a visit to Beijing last week, Lam called on U.S. officials to end what she called repeated interference in Hong Kong and Chinese affairs.

“I hope that they will come back to normalcy and accept that the relationship has to be built on mutual respect and cooperation,” Lam told reporters.

Also Tuesday, a Hong Kong journalist who helped produce a documentary about the actions of Hong Kong police during anti-government protests last year appeared in court on charges of making false statements while obtaining information from a vehicle database.

Choy Yuk-ling, a producer at public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong, was arrested earlier this month on charges of making false statements about why she was obtaining license plate information from a publicly accessible database.

Hong Kong police were accused of heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the protests and of not intervening during a violent clash between protesters and a mob of men in a subway station.

The protests, which went on for months and became increasingly violent, were cited by Beijing as a primary justification for imposing the national security law, which Hong Kong’s own local legislature had been unable to pass on its own.

Wang, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, reiterated Beijing’s reasoning in his comments to reporters, saying the central government had been forced to step in at a time when Hong Kong’s security was under serious threat.

“The purpose is to punish those who severely undermine national security and protect the vast majority of Hong Kong residents abiding by the law,” Wang said."

Global stocks rise for 2nd day on coronavirus vaccine hopesBy JOE McDONALDAP Business WriterThe Associated PressBEIJING

BEIJING (AP) — Global stocks and U.S. futures rose for second day Tuesday on hopes for progress toward a possible coronavirus vaccine that might allow the world to revive manufacturing, shopping and normal life.

Market benchmarks in London, Frankfurt and Tokyo advanced while Shanghai closed lower. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 has been trading at 29-year highs as shares rallied after Joe Biden was declared president-elect days after the U.S. presidential election. News about possible progress on a COVID-19 vaccine have pushed prices still higher.

Investors were enthusiastic after Pfizer Inc. said Monday early data on a vaccine under development suggest it might be it might be 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, though that doesn’t mean its release is imminent.

“This offers a ray of hope that the market did not hesitate to take advantage of,” Tai Hui of J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report.

In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.6% to 6,222.92 while the DAX in Frankfurt added 0.2% to 13,119.63. The CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.2% to 5,352.98.

On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index rose another 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% higher.

On Monday, the S&P 500 advanced 1.2% and the Dow surged 2.9% after Pfizer indicated the company and its partner, BioNTech of Germany, are on track to file an emergency application for use of their vaccine with U.S. regulators.

In Asia, the Nikkei 225 gained 0.3% to 24,905.59 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.9% to 25,243.16.

The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4% to 3,360.15 after spending most of the day in positive territory. Authorities said they have quarantined 186 people and conducted virus tests on more than 8,000 after a freight handler at the city’s main international airport tested positive for COVID-19.

No additional cases have been found, the city government said on its microblog Tuesday. It remains unclear how the 51-year-old man contracted the virus, which has largely spared the sprawling metropolis despite its dense population and strong international links.

The Kospi in Seoul added 0.2% to 2,452.83 and the S&P-ASX 200 in Sydney advanced 0.7% to 6,340.50. India’s Sensex was 1.4% higher at 43,190.99. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also rose.

Also Tuesday, China reported October inflation fell to its lowest level in a decade. That gives Beijing room to spend more or ease access to credit further to support an economic recovery that is strengthening.

The Philippines reported its economic output shrank by 11.5% from a year earlier in the quarter ending in September.

Markets were relieved by the resolution to extended uncertainty about the battle for the U.S. presidency. Over the weekend, Joe Biden clinched the final Electoral College votes to unseat President Donald Trump, though Trump has yet to concede.

Congress may be split between Democratic control of the House of Representatives and Republicans in the Senate. Investors appear to be hoping that might constrain a Biden administration’s possible moves on tax increases and regulatory changes.

The impact of Pfizer’s vaccine announcement highlighted the virus’s economic dominance, temporarily overshadowing concerns over who controls the U.S. government. The number of confirmed U.S. virus cases passed 10 million on Monday, the world’s highest total.

Potential legislative gridlock also makes chances of a rescue package for the economy from Congress likely to be smaller than if Democrats had swept control of all of Washington.

In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude oil gained 22 cents to $40.51 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract soared $3.15 on Monday to $40.29. Brent crude, the price standard for international oils, rose 24 cents to $42.65 in London. It rose $2.95 the previous session to $42.40.

The dollar declined to 104.99 yen from Monday’s 105.45 yen. The euro declined to $1.1826 from $1.1831."

Tropical Storm Eta floods already drenched Florida citiesBy FREIDA FRISARO and KELLI KENNEDYAssociated PressThe Associated PressFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A deluge of rain from Tropical Storm Eta caused flooding Monday across South Florida’s most densely populated urban areas, stranding cars, flooding businesses, and swamping entire neighborhoods with fast-rising water that had no place to drain.

Elsewhere, forecasters announced that Subtropical Storm Theta, a record-breaking 29th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season, had formed far out in the northeast Atlantic by late Monday night. It posed no immediate threat to land.

Eta made landfall in the Florida Keys and posed a serious threat across South Florida, which was already drenched from more than 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain last month.

“Never seen this, never, not this deep,” said Anthony Lyas, who has lived in his now-waterlogged Fort Lauderdale neighborhood since 1996. He described hearing water and debris slamming against his shuttered home overnight.

After striking Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane and killing nearly 70 people from Mexico to Panama, the storm moved into the Gulf of Mexico early Monday near where the Everglades meet the sea, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph).

“It was far worse than we could’ve ever imagined, and we were prepared,” said Arbie Walker, a 27-year-old student whose Fort Lauderdale apartment was filled with 5 or 6 inches (13 to 15 centimeters) of water.

“It took us 20 minutes to navigate out of our neighborhood due to the heavy flooding in our area,” Walker added. Floodwaters also submerged half of his sister’s car.

As much as 16 inches of rain damaged one of the state’s largest COVID-19 testing sites, at Miami-Dade County’s Hard Rock Stadium, officials said. Throughout the pandemic, it has been among the busiest places to get a coronavirus diagnosis. The site was expected to be closed until Wednesday or Thursday.

Eta hit land late Sunday as it blew over Lower Matecumbe, in the middle of the chain of small islands that form the Keys, but the heavily populated areas of Miami-Dade and Broward Counties bore the brunt of the fury.

It was the 28th named storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. And late Monday, it was followed by the 29th — Theta.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Theta broke the record of 28 named storms in 2005. Theta had developed about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers) southwest of the Azores, bearing top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as that system moved eastward at 15 mph (24 kph).

Late Monday night, Eta was about 180 miles (285 kilometers) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, moving southwest at 9 mph (15 kph). Forecasters said the storm, which had slowed in recent hours, was expected to strengthen overnight as it meanders in the southeatern Gulf of Mexico.

Forecasters said the system could intensify again into a minimal hurricane once it slowly moves up the southwest Gulf Coast. It is just far enough offshore to maintain its strength while dumping vast amounts of water across the lower third of the Florida peninsula. Rain and wind also were felt as far north as the Tampa Bay area.

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it a 100-year rain event.

“Once the ground becomes saturated, there’s really no place for the water to go,” Trantalis said. “It’s not like a major hurricane. It’s more of a rain event, and we’re just doing our best to ensure that the people in our community are being protected.”

City officials dispatched some 24 tanker trucks with giant vacuums to soak up water from the past few weeks. Some older neighborhoods simply do not have any drainage. The city also passed out 6,000 sandbags to worried residents over the weekend, but water seeped into homes and stranded cars in parking lots and along roadways.

“There was just so much rain in such a short amount of time there was no where for it to go,” said Fort Lauderdale resident Morgan Shattuck, who took photos of flooding on her street that showed swiftly moving water near the top of vehicles’ wheels.

Randi Barry, 36, also woke up Monday to flooded streets outside her home in Fort Lauderdale, and joined her neighbors in helping people whose cars were stuck in high water.

“There are a lot of people with their doors open, getting furniture up to higher ground and trying to get water out of their homes,” Barry said.

A tractor-trailer was left dangling off the elevated Palmetto Expressway in Miami, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The driver lost control on the wet, slick road and suffered minor injuries, CBS 4 in Miami reported.

“Please take this storm seriously,” urged Palm Beach County Emergency Management Director Bill Johnson. “Please don’t drive through flooded roadways.”

Firefighters had pulled a person from a car that had driven into a canal Sunday night in Lauderhill, north of Miami. The patient was hospitalized in critical condition, according to a statement from Lauderhill Fire.

In the Keys, the mayor ordered mandatory evacuations for mobile home and RV parks, campgrounds and other low-lying areas. School districts closed, saying the roads were already too flooded and the winds could be too gusty for buses to transport students. But the islands were spared any major damage, and officials expected shelters to close and schools to reopen by Tuesday.

Aside from a banyan tree that fell on a home and injured people inside, Key Largo was largely unscathed, Fire Chief Don Bock said.

Eta was not done yet with Cuba, just 90 miles (140 kilometers) south of Florida, where the storm continued to swell rivers and flood coastal zones. Some 25,000 people were evacuated with no reports of deaths, but rainfall continued, with total accumulations of up to 25 inches (63 centimeters) predicted. A tropical storm watch was in effect for parts of the island.

Nearly a week after Eta crashed ashore in Nicaragua, authorities from Panama to Guatemala have reported more than 100 dead and an even higher number of missing. Extensive flooding and landslides have affected hundreds of thousands of people in countries already struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic.

The hesitation was hidden in a dramatic click-bait article headlined, “Lawyers can’t find the parents of 666 migrant kids, a higher number than previously reported.” The article first spotlighted the lawyer-created claim that:

Lawyers working to reunite migrant families separated by the Trump administration before and during its “zero tolerance” policy at the border now believe the number of separated children for whom they have not been able to find parents is 666, higher than they told a federal judge last month, according to an email obtained by NBC News.

But the lawyer’s unverifiable claim that lawyers cannot contact the foreign parents of 121 extra children in the United States is less newsworthy than the news about Biden’s hesitation buried at the end of the article:

President-elect Joe Biden has committed to establishing a government task force that would work to reunite all migrant families separated by Trump administration policies. But, according to two sources familiar with the incoming administration’s planning on immigration, Biden has so far not decided whether separated parents will be given the opportunity to come to the U.S. to reunite with their children.

The posting of the NBC report suggests the ACLU lawyers are using the NBC reporters to pressure Biden’s deputies to let the foreign parents join their children in the United States — and so create a new child-first legal route for migrants to get through the U.S. border and into U.S. society.

But Biden must be cautious about his border policies because he may trigger an avalanche of hopeful migrants in time for the 2020 elections, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. For example, if Biden “undoes [the Remain in Mexico policy]. 60,000 people are going to come across the border” in a very short time, he said, adding:

Are they going to let them all in at once? Do they have any conception of the political disaster their immigration policies will visit on them? … In six months, they could face a [migration] disaster. The contrast is; ‘Trump had immigration under control and now we have this disaster!”

“This is a political time-bomb for them — they can’t be stupid about it,” he told Breitbart News.

The issue will be painful for Biden — if he is inaugurated — because he used the media-magnified claims of “kids in cages” and “separated families” as an emotional prod in the 2020 election campaign. The prod was used to motivate Democrat-leaning women — and Latino women — to gamble on Joe Biden’s mixture of radical social policies and Barack Obama’s economic status quo.

The “separated families” claim was hyped at the end of the campaign amid the ACLU’s suggestions that it could not get in contact with the parents of 545 migrant children following their mothers’ or fathers’ repatriation.

The story was “wholly inaccurate,” said a tweet from Chase Jennings, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. “Out of the parents of 485 children whom Plaintiffs’ counsel has been able to contact, they’ve yet to identify a single family that wants their child reunited with them in their country of origin.”

Since 2011, many Latin American migrants have exploited a 2008 law to transport their children into the United States.

Under the law, children found at the border are placed with close relatives or friends — including illegals — in the United States, so ensuring the foreign children can grow up in safe neighborhoods and also go to American K-12 schools.

Many Latin American parents have hired coyotes to escort their children and teens to the United States’ border in the justified expectation that the agencies will reunite them with their illegal-immigrant parents in U.S. cities or let the children live with other relatives.in the United States.

From 2014 to April 2020, federal agencies relayed 245,245 foreign children — including many teenagers and young men who claimed to be younger than 19 — to friendly homes in the United States. Those homes were often set up the migrant parents who used asylum claims to stream past border agents and then into U.S. blue-collar workplaces and neighborhoods from 2012 to 2020.

This out-of-control chain migration played a huge role in getting Donald Trump into the 2016 race and into the White House. It also helped to wreck Obama’s ratings and kill the 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill.

The chain-migration strategy was spotlighted by a November 2 article in the Washington Post, which interviewed a Honduran woman who regretfully is leaving her child in the United States with relatives in Houston:

In November 2018, after seven months in [U.S.] detention, Noyemi was deported back to her native Honduras. By then, [her child] Jarvin had been sent to live with his great-aunt in Houston. […] So now she’s here, in a quiet subdivision at the edge of this [Mexican] industrial city, cleaning houses and babysitting other people’s children during the day, waiting for her 7 o’clock phone call. “Mommy, I hear you,” Jarvin squealed Saturday night. “Look how handsome you are,” Noyemi said. “How was school today?” she asked. “Did you behave yourself?” “Look at these words I learned,” he said, and flashed the phone’s camera to hand-scrawled letters: The Spanish for “computer” and butterfly.”

The Washington Post noted the woman has tried to sneak into the United States, and also suggested she does not want the child to be sent back to her in Mexico:

No one told her she could choose for her son to be deported back to Honduras, she said (though that option was hardly ideal). […] Some deported parents were given the option of having their children returned to their countries of origin, but many declined … Others, such as Noyemi, were not told of that option. The ACLU said it was heartened by Biden’s pledge to reunify families in the United States.

In 2020, Trump’s deputies finally blocked most of this semi-legal chain migration and returned roughly 9,000 younger migrants to guardians in their home countries.

Biden’s 2020 plan would reverse many of trump’s pro-American migration policies. He promised to “reassert America’s commitment to asylum-seekers and refugees,” to wipe out Trump’s asylum reforms, bar any deportations for 100 days, and end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony.

Biden also promised to let companies import more visa workers, let mayors import temporary workers, and allow an unlimited flow of foreign graduates through U.S. universities into white-collar jobs. He would “exempt from any cap [the] recent graduates of Ph.D. programs in STEM fields.”

Joe Biden’s asylum and open-border policies will destroy the American middle class by releasing millions of foreign migrants into the United States, Stephen Miller told reporters October 28. https://t.co/BaeLSIud7y — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 28, 2020

Biden also wants to accelerate the inflow of chain migration migrants and dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year."

Pent-up global wish list of hopes, demands awaits BidenBy JOHN LEICESTER, JILL LAWLESS and JAMEY KEATENAssociated PressThe Associated PressLONDON

LONDON (AP) — Spare a thought for the people who’ll be managing Joe Biden’s presidential appointment diary.

Four years of inward-looking “America First” leadership by outgoing President Donald Trump have generated pent-up global demand for a more engaged and amenable America.

The leaders of governments and global institutions will likely be hammering on White House doors and email inboxes with a long wish list of priorities they want American help with — which, on issues big and small, from climate change to taxing Internet companies, Trump’s administration often refused to provide.

Beating back the coronavirus pandemic and slowing the rise in global temperatures are top priorities for America’s partners. Beyond them: a dizzying array of other issues vital to specific regions and nations now hoping to be heard by the incoming administration.

“Tackling climate change, trade, international security,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, listing in an interview on Sunday with The Associated Press just some of the things that he wants to talk about.

“Many, many, many, many, many other issues.”

Overall, there are broad expectations for a White House that will be easier to work with, and that solutions will flow from there.

“The big difference will be in the communication, that we treat each other again with full respect as partners, allies,” said Peter Beyer, a German lawmaker who coordinates trans-Atlantic contacts for the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose relationship with Trump never really developed beyond frosty.

“President Donald Trump didn’t always differentiate between friends and foes.”

Here’s a look at some of the big issues that world capitals want Biden’s help with:

___

THE PANDEMIC

Those involved, from World Health Organization experts to doctors and nurses on front lines, argue that nations will beat the coronavirus faster by working together.

But that proved a tough sell with Trump, whose presidency was ultimately, in part, undone by his refusal to heed scientific advice. His administration dealt a blow to global coordination by announcing a U.S. withdrawal from WHO.

Biden’s election immediately raised hopes that the world will now benefit more readily from U.S. investment in treatment efforts.

“You cannot have a country by country approach. You need a global approach,” Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, told the AP.

She said she hopes the United States will join with a WHO-led project, the Covax Facility, which aims to deploy vaccines to the world’s neediest people.

The head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, also told the AP that he has heightened expectations.

“The world has always been a better place in terms of fighting diseases when America has played a key leadership role,” he said.

A chief doctor at a front-line hospital dealing with the explosion of COVID-19 cases in Paris said he doesn’t expect that U.S. pharmaceutical companies will share any medical breakthroughs for free, but is hopeful that people outside the United States might now benefit more readily.

“Although Biden is a Democrat, he is still the U.S. president (-elect), so we shouldn’t expect free philanthropy if the patents and copyrights for all of the medicines that emerge come from the United States,” said Dr. Philippe Montravers, head of critical care at Paris’ Bichat Hospital.

But Montravers, himself recently recovered himself from a nasty bout of COVID-19, said he expects the Biden administration will be “less aggressive.”

“Less oriented on ‘America First’ and ‘Nothing but America,’” he said.

___

CLIMATE CHANGE

Licypriya Kangujam, age 9, is among those hoping the United States will get back in the fight against global warming.

“The United States and India can do more together,” the Indian child activist said.

Now, multiply her voice by countless others around the world who are looking forward to Biden making good on his promise to plug the United States back into climate protection efforts from the get-go in the Oval Office.

“America is a leader. Where America goes others follow,” said Desmond Majekodunmi, an environmentalist in Nigeria.

South Asia, home to almost one-fourth of the world’s population, and other regions are already seeing the effects of climate change. Major cities are becoming increasingly prone to devastating floods. Longer-than-usual summers are bringing unbearable heat waves and disruption in rainfall patterns that impact agriculture. For island nations, delayed action brings mounting concern.

“Together, we have a planet to save from a #ClimateEmergency,” the prime minister of the Pacific island nation of Fiji said in his tweeted congratulations to Biden.

“Now, more than ever, we need the USA at the helm of these multilateral efforts.”

___

BUILDING ALLIANCES

After the disruptive “America First” diplomacy of Trump, world leaders want Biden to revive Washington’s role as a leader of alliances. Among their priorities are containing Chinese and Russian strategic ambitions and North Korea’s nuclear program.

“American leadership is indispensable to meeting these challenges,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, referring to fears of Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea.

Asian governments on edge about China’s growing military power invoked their “shared values” with the United States and expressed hope for close relations.

In Europe, Biden has pledged to strengthen U.S. alliances and supports NATO, which Trump showed disdain for.

But it’s unclear if he will reverse Trump’s order to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Germany from 36,000 to 24,000, seen as Trump’s punishment for Germany’s failure to spend 2% of its annual economic output on defense.

Russia is looking for Biden to extend the last remaining arms control agreement between the two nations. Ukraine is expecting increased military and humanitarian aid, and anticipating that it could again be drawn into the invariably multifaceted, delicate and frequently complex ballet of relations between Washington and Moscow.

“Biden’s geopolitical game includes Ukraine as a significant player,” said Vladimir Fesenko of the Penta analytical center in Kiev. “It will be important for Biden to have this strategic trump card.”

___

AFRICA

The continent of 54 countries and 1.3 billion people is, for starters, looking for more respect.

“A return to an American president who doesn’t insult African countries,” South African columnist Barney Mthombothi said, referring to Trump’s remarks in 2018 that likened African countries to filthy toilets.

Africans are also looking for American leadership to promote democracy.

“Many in Africa recognized Trump as someone who acted like an authoritarian leader, like some leaders here in Africa,” author and human rights activist Elinor Sisulu said. “It was a pernicious influence.”

Livingstone Sewanyana, head of the Uganda-based civic group Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, said he hopes Biden will “restore that sense of civility among nations, but also among the people of nations.”

“He is experienced,” he said. “He has demonstrated empathy for ordinary people.”

___

THE MIDDLE EAST

The region presents Biden with opportunities to set himself apart from Trump, but few easy solutions.

Among Trump policies that Biden’s team has pledged to reverse, one of the most widely felt is a ban that limits travel from five majority-Muslim nations — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

World powers hope Biden will work again with them on curbing Iran’s nuclear program — without the brinksmanship that Trump pursued, almost to war in January.

The mood in Tehran’s streets after Biden’s victory was cautious optimism.

“It has offered us hope,” passerby Jaber Nejati said. “Now it depends on us and our statesmen on how they can use this opportunity.”

What the former vice president to Barack Obama will do in Iraq and Syria remains in question.

“We saw what Obama did to Iraq when he was the president, his decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq is an example. It led to increased Iranian intervention in Iraqi affairs,” said Yousif Emad, a 26-year-old dentist. “Biden will bring us back to Obama’s era or even worse!”

Further afield, Biden inherits America’s longest war in Afghanistan. While pledging to “end the forever wars,” Biden has said he’d keep a small contingent of U.S. troops there. Peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled in Qatar.

The Taliban itself described the U.S. election as “internal changes.”

The Latest: Shanghai quarantines 186 after case at airportBy The Associated PressThe Associated Press

BEIJING — Authorities in China’s financial hub of Shanghai have quarantined 186 people and conducted virus tests on more than 8,000 after a freight handler at the city’s main international airport tested positive for the coronavirus.

The city government said on its microblog Tuesday that it remains unclear how the 51-year-old man contracted the virus, which has largely spared the sprawling metropolis despite its dense population and strong international links. It says no additional cases have been found.

In China’s northern port city of Tianjin, more than 77,000 people have been tested after a locally transmitted case was reported there Monday. That case was believed to be linked to a cold storage warehouse, reinforcing suspicions that the virus may be spreading to victims from frozen food packaging.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

FARGO, N.D. — North Dakota’s governor says health care workers who have tested positive for the coronavirus but have no symptoms should be allowed to stay on the job as part of an effort to ease the stress on hospitals and medical personnel dealing with the pandemic.

Gov. Doug Burgum said Monday the CDC allows such personnel to keep working as long as they take precautions.

Burgum says leaders from the six major hospitals in the state will meet daily to discuss hospital space and staffing, with the likelihood of shifting personnel among them. Some hospitals are suspending some elective surgeries.

The governor also announced that every county in the state has been declared at high risk, so businesses will be limited to 25% capacity. He says masks “should be required.”

___

HARTFORD, Conn:. — Pfizer’s senior vice president of drug safety says the timing of the company’s announcement was of progress in its coronavirus vaccine was not related in any way to the presidential election and was made as soon as the efficacy data was ready.

John Burkhardt told reporters Monday that no corners were cut, but the company broke with standard practice and has been manufacturing the vaccine even as the vaccine goes through the approval process.

He says that ”normally, you wouldn’t spend $1 billion to manufacture a product that may not work. You wait and see whether it works and whether it’s safe and then you do the manufacturing. So we did that at risk. That was a decision that was made very early in the process.”

___

DES MOINES, Iowa — Two more Iowa prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections.

The Iowa Department of Corrections says testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates and Rockwell City has 426.

The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison and updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive.

Additional smaller prison outbreaks also have been reported. In total, 1,145 inmates and 103 staff members are positive in Iowa’s prisons.

___

TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas has reported another record seven-day spike in coronavirus cases to push the state past 100,000 for the pandemic as officials wrestle with getting more residents to wear masks.

The state health department added 5,920 new confirmed and probable cases to the state’s tally since Friday, bringing the total to 103,553 since the pandemic began. The state averaged 2,047 new cases a day for the seven days ending Monday.

The state also reported 15 more COVID-19-related deaths to bring the pandemic total to 1,081.

Gov. Laura Kelly’s staff, legislative leaders and local officials launched discussions about encouraging mask use before last week’s elections, and officials say those discussions will continue. There is still resistance to mask mandates from many local officials and the legislature.

___

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Florida officials say one of the major COVID-19 testing sites in the state suffered major damage due to the extensive rain dumped by Tropical Storm Eta in South Florida.

Samantha Bequer, spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said parts of the Hard Rock Stadium’s site were trapped beneath 16 inches of rain. Throughout the pandemic, it has been one of the state’s busiest places for people to get a coronavirus diagnosis.

All of the testing sites in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties managed by the state government closed on Sunday and Monday due to the tropical storm. State officials said testing sites in Lee County also were forced to close due to the storm’s impact. The state has not officially said when it would reopen any of them.

___

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — West Virginia has smashed weekly records for confirmed coronavirus cases, while the death toll was pushed higher Monday after more than two dozen previously unreported fatalities were discovered, health officials said.

The state reported 2,418 new positive cases over the six-day period ending Saturday, a 5% increase from the previous week’s record of 2,304 confirmed cases set in a seven-day period. Figures for Sunday were not posted due to a technical glitch, and the record easily could be adjusted higher as daily probable cases are confirmed.

The state has set weekly high marks in four of the past five weeks.

Health officials reported a record 44 virus-related deaths last week alone, and a revision made Monday to include previously unreported virus fatalities brought the state’s death toll to at least 530.

___

MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin health officials reported another dip in new COVID-19 infections Monday from a record high over the weekend.

The Department of Health Services reported 4,360 new confirmed infections. That’s up from 4,280 on Sunday but still dramatically fewer than the record 7,065 cases recorded on Saturday. The disease was a factor in another 17 deaths.

The state has now seen 271,770 cases and 2,329 COVID-19-related deaths since the pandemic began in March. As of Sunday the state ranked fourth in the nation in per capita cases over the last two weeks with 69,244 cases per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The Wisconsin Hospital Association reported that as of Monday afternoon 2,003 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, including 396 in intensive care and 574 on ventilators.

___

NEW ORLEANS — The health director for the city of New Orleans notes two possible factors behind the city’s success in avoiding the sort of spike in coronavirus cases that is plaguing other parts of the nation.

Dr. Jennifer Avegno said Monday that relatively warm south Louisiana weather is likely one reason.

Another is the willingness of residents to comply with the city’s requirement to wear masks in public places.

She said mask-wearing has been normal in New Orleans for months and she credits it with saving “countless lives,” while allowing businesses to open.

She spoke as New Orleans officials announced the latest plan to ease virus-related restrictions — including allowing bars to start serving customers indoors, with a 25% limit on capacity.

Avegno warned that residents cannot become complacent, especially as the colder winter months approach.

___

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Top medical officers for some of New Mexico’s largest hospital systems said Monday they’re now at or above normal capacity as the coronavirus pandemic surges across the state.

They said during a briefing that they are seeing the strain on staff and that the current pace of caring for increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients and those hospitalized for other illnesses and trauma will be unsustainable over the long-term.

More than 1,200 additional cases have been reported in each of the last three days as hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise.

Despite having some of the toughest public health restrictions since the pandemic started, New Mexico has been struggling with exponential increases over the past month. The total number of cases for the state is close to topping 55,000, with more than 14% of those being reported in just the last week.

___

SALT LAKE CITY — Deeply conservative Utah began a major shift in fighting the coronavirus pandemic Monday, implementing a statewide mask mandate for the first time and planning a dramatic increase in testing.

The move came a couple of days after the presidential race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, but Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said the mask mandate’s timing wasn’t political. He said it was an essential move to avoid disaster with a surge already threatening to overwhelm hospitals ahead of the holiday season.

He says politics has gotten in the way of addressing the crisis effectively.

Utah joins more than 30 other states that have implemented statewide mask orders since the pandemic began.

___

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — More than 700 people in Maryland were hospitalized with the coronavirus as of Monday morning, an increase of 52 in a 24-hour period and the highest since mid-June, the state reported.

Of the 707 people in the hospital, the state reported 168 were in intensive care. Hospitalizations have climbed in recent weeks. On Oct. 1, there were 331 people hospitalized.

Gov. Larry Hogan, who warned of a surge in coronavirus cases at a news conference last week, said Monday on Twitter that the state has reached “a critical point” in the fight against COVID-19.

The governor said Maryland’s seven-day positivity rate exceeds 5% for the first time since June 24.

“While our state has been preparing for this fall surge for the past eight months, we cannot afford to let our guard down,” the Republican governor said. “Wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance.”

___

ROME — Several regions in Italy, from north to south, are being put under semi-lockdown restrictions by the government, struggling to tamp down a several weeks-long surge in COVID-19 infections.

Governors of the regions said they were informed about the measures, which will take effect Wednesday, including a ban on leaving one’s town except for essential reasons and closing restaurants, bars and cafes except for takeout and delivery orders.

Getting the “orange-zone” designation will be Liguria, a seaside region in northwest Italy; the north central regions of Umbria and Tuscany; the south-central region of Abruzzo; and Basilicata in the southern “instep” of the boot-shaped peninsula.

Last week, four regions became “red zones,” which endure the most severe restrictions currently in Italy, which greatly limit the reasons citizens can leave their homes.

The government on Tuesday was expected to decide whether to make southern Campania, whose chief city is densely populated Naples, a red zone.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. has confirmed more than 10 million coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, as infections continue to rise in nearly every state.

The U.S. hit the milestone on Monday.

New daily confirmed cases are up more than 60% over the past two weeks, to an average of nearly 109,000 a day. Average daily cases are on the rise in 48 states.

The U.S. accounts for about one fifth of the world’s 50 million confirmed cases.

U.S. coronavirus deaths are up 18% over the past two weeks, averaging 939 every day. The virus has now killed more than 237,000 Americans."

Polish police carry away abortion rights protestersThe Associated PressWARSAW, Poland

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Police carried off protesters blocking a street in Poland’s capital Monday, the 19th straight day of nationwide anti-government protests that were triggered by the tightening of the predominantly Roman Catholic nation’s abortion law.

The protesters were sitting down in the street in Warsaw in front of the Education Ministry to demand the firing of the new minister who has made some statements on education and human rights that have angered many people. A few hundred protesters then marched in downtown Warsaw to drumming, blocking streets, and chanted that the right-wing government’s policies have made them very angry.

More protests were also held in some other cities, like Katowice or Bialystok, with participants demanding abortion rights for women and for the government to go.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has been appealing to people to stay home and express their anger on the internet because of the coronavirus pandemic. Public gatherings have been banned as part of COVID-19 regulations.

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in regular peaceful protests that have been held across Poland since Oct. 22 when a constitutional court ruled that abortion of fetuses with congenital defects violates Poland’s supreme law.

When the ruling takes effect, at an unspecified date, abortion will be permitted only when a pregnancy endangers a woman’s health, or results from crimes like rape or incest."

The night — intended to mark a victory that never came — has become yet another symbol of the president’s cavalier attitude toward a virus that is ripping across the nation and infecting more than 100,000 people a day.

Ben Carson, the secretary for housing and urban development, tested positive, a department spokesperson confirmed Monday, as did David Bossie, who was recently tasked with overseeing the campaign’s legal challenges contesting the election’s outcome.

The event had been under scrutiny since another attendee, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, contracted the virus, which has now killed more than 238,000 people in the U.S. alone.

Carson’s deputy chief of staff, Coalter Baker, said the secretary “is in good spirits” and “feels fortunate to have access to effective therapeutics which aid and markedly speed his recovery.” Carson is a retired neurosurgeon.

The White House has repeatedly refused to say who else has tested positive, even as the virus continues to spread. The latest White House cluster, coming just a month after Trump’s own diagnosis and hospitalization, includes a top Trump campaign official as well as a handful of undisclosed White House staff, officials said.

The White House has been increasingly secretive about outbreaks. Many White House and campaign officials, as well as those who attended the election watch party, were kept in the dark about the diagnoses, unaware until they were disclosed by the press.

That the virus would continue to spread in the White House — even though senior staff and those who come into close contact with the president and vice president are frequently tested — has come as no surprise to public health officials who have balked at the White House’s lax approach.

And polls suggest that attitude was a serious drag on the president’s reelection bid as voters chose to deny Trump a second term in favor of his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, who is now the president-elect.

“The administration was cavalier about the risks of the virus for themselves and for the country. And that’s one reason why we have so many cases,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University’s school of public health.

Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he has been avoiding the White House since August “because my impression was their approach to how to handle this was different from mine and what I insisted that we do in the Senate, which is to wear a mask and practice social distancing,”

Trump had long claimed, without basis, that the virus was being hyped by Democrats to hurt his reelection chances and would miraculously “disappear” after Nov. 3.

Meadows, in particular, has long tried to play down the severity of the virus. He rarely wore a mask in public, except during the period immediately following Trump’s infection. At one point, he refused to speak to reporters on Capitol Hill after they requested he wear a mask.

He was again without one during Tuesday evening’s East Room event, where more than 100 of Trump’s most loyal supporters, family members and Cabinet secretaries gathered to watch the election results come in and see him deliver what they had hoped would be a victory speech.

It was a festive atmosphere, with half-empty glasses of wine and other beverages strewn across cocktail tables in front of news cameras. Meadows, who spent time with Trump’s family beforehand, was seen working the room, including giving several fist bumps to those in attendance, before Trump took the stage early Wednesday morning.

Carson was there, along with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar — who did wear a mask.

While everyone who attended the East Room event had been tested in advance for the virus, there was no social distancing and minimal mask-wearing.

Earlier that day, Meadows had also accompanied the president to his campaign’s headquarters in Virginia, where Trump received rousing cheers from several dozen staff and volunteers. Meadows did not wear a mask, nor did other White House staffers. Campaign aides largely did.

If Meadows tested positive Wednesday — as Bloomberg News reported — he would likely have been infectious during both events, said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist who teaches at George Mason University.

Meadows had also traveled with Trump in the run-up to Election Day, attending dozens of rallies where he was frequently seen interacting with supporters without masks.

Trump’s refusal to abide by his own government’s public health guidelines throughout the campaign was a major source of frustration for local governments as he scheduled rally after rally in defiance of local caps on crowd sizes, even in pandemic hot zones.

While Trump had hoped his efforts to downplay the virus in a bid to revive a limping economy would help him with voters, many Republicans now believe that Trump might have won reelection had he handled things differently.

Still, Trump’s approach reflected the priorities of his supporters. AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate, found that about half of Trump voters called the economy and jobs the top issue facing the nation, versus just 1 in 10 Biden voters. A majority of Biden voters, meanwhile — about 6 in 10 — said the pandemic was the most important issue facing the country.

The White House did not respond to specific questions about the current outbreak, but said that contact tracing had been conducted by the White House Medical Unit, consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

“Appropriate notifications and recommendations have been made,” the White House said.

The CDC defines “close contact” as spending at least 15 minutes within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of an infected person beginning two days before they test positive or exhibit symptoms.

But Popescu called the party, in particular, “a ripe environment for transmission to occur,” and said anyone in attendance should have been informed and asked to take precautions.

“While they might not meet CDC guidelines for exposure, I think when we’re looking at an indoor event with a lot of people for a prolonged period who are unmasked, out of an abundance of caution, everyone should be notified and encouraged to stay home,” she said.

“Now is not the time to be cavalier about the risks,” Sharfstein said.

Ohio pastor Darrell Scott, a close ally of the president who attended the party, said he was unaware any White House officials beyond Meadows had tested positive until informed by a reporter and had not been contacted by any tracer.

While Scott, like many in Trump’s orbit, continued to insist fraud was to blame for the president’s loss — despite no credible evidence supporting those claims — he also blamed Trump for several “unforced errors” during the campaign, including the way he talked about the virus.

“I can’t be upset if we shoot ourselves in the foot,” he said.

The latest outbreak came less than two weeks after several aides to Vice President Mike Pence, including his chief of staff, tested positive for the virus. And it came a month after Trump, first lady Melania Trump and at least two dozen others tested positive after Trump held large gatherings of people not wearing masks, including the ceremony announcing the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

Cowboys’ Gilbert appears set for 1st NFL start vs. SteelersThe Associated PressARLINGTON, Ttexas

ARLINGTON, Ttexas (AP) — Garrett Gilbert appears set for his first NFL start for the Dallas Cowboys against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers.

The NFL Network, citing unidentified sources, reported the Cowboys planned to start Gilbert at home Sunday. Gilbert’s agent, Leigh Steinberg, posted on Twitter that he was traveling to “see Garrett Gilbert start” against the Steelers.

The Cowboys will start their fourth different quarterback in the past five games. Star Dak Prescott is out for the season after breaking his ankle in Week 5 against the New York Giants. Two weeks later, Andy Dalton was knocked out of a game in Washington because of a concussion and has since been placed on the COVID-19 list.

Ben DiNucci started last week’s 23-9 loss to Philadelphia, but the rookie seventh-round pick was so overmatched, coach Mike McCarthy said the starter against Pittsburgh would be either Gilbert or Cooper Rush. Neither has started an NFL game, but both have been in the league much longer than DiNucci.

Gilbert’s first start would come six years after he was drafted by the Rams. He has thrown six passes in his career. Dallas signed him off Cleveland’s practice squad after Prescott’s injury.

Rush was Prescott’s backup for most of three seasons before the Cowboys signed Andy Dalton in the offseason. Dalton started for nine years in Cincinnati before the Bengals drafted Joe Burrow No. 1 overall and moved on from Dalton.

Dallas waived Rush after signing Dalton, and Rush ended up on the practice squad of the New York Giants before his release in late September. Rush rejoined the Cowboys after Dalton’s concussion.

The Cowboys were expecting Dalton to return against Pittsburgh before the COVID-19 issue arose. McCarthy says Dalton should return late next week, when Dallas has its bye.

Gilbert is the son of former NFL quarterback Gale Gilbert, who was the backup to Jim Kelly on all four Buffalo teams that reached the Super Bowl in the 1990s. He started for the Texas Longhorns in 2010-11 before losing his job and eventually transferring to SMU

Trump faces long odds in challenging state vote countsBy MARYCLAIRE DALEAssociated PressThe Associated Press

Republican surrogates for President Donald Trump resumed their legal fight Monday to try to stop the vote count in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but faced long odds given the Electoral College tally and recent court rulings that found no evidence of widespread vote fraud.

While some Republican officials invoked the Trump mantra that only “legal votes” should be counted, others emerged to counter the campaign narrative and urge voters, and perhaps the president, to support the results.

“The process has not failed our country in more than 200 years, and it is not going to fail our country this year,” said Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who won her reelection bid and has congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his victory.

Still, Trump lawyers soldiered on six days after the election, just as personal counsel Rudy Giuliani had promised they would during a surreal weekend press conference outside a landscaping storefront in northeast Philadelphia.

Giuliani denounced the city’s vote count — which fell about 4-1 for Biden, giving the Democrat the win Saturday in both Pennsylvania and the U.S. election — as “extremely troubling.”

Across the country, Republicans have complained about problems with the signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mail-in ballots, the inability of their poll watchers to scrutinize them and the extensions granted for mail-in ballots to arrive. They filed another lawsuit Monday evening in federal court in Pennsylvania.

Attorney General William Barr on Monday authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities” before the election is certified.

His action, described in a memo to U.S. attorneys across the country, gives prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is formally certified.

Judges have largely rejected the Republican challenges over the past week, when the campaign sought to interrupt the vote count as it leaned toward Biden. Trump has yet to concede the election, even as the former vice president claimed victory and got to work on his transition plans.

At the U.S. Supreme Court, 10 Republican state attorneys general filed an amicus brief Monday to support a challenge to Pennsylvania’s decision to count mail-in ballots that arrived through Friday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had agreed with Democratic state officials who wanted to extend the deadline amid concerns about Postal Service delays and the COVID-19 pandemic. The attorneys general say the court usurped a power reserved for state lawmakers.

The U.S. Supreme Court had declined to fast-track the challenge, but the vote was 4-4, and three justices expressed reservations. Republicans now hope to try again with new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the court. The attorneys general believe the extra time meant “unscrupulous actors could attempt to influence a close Presidential election.”

Still, it’s far from clear that enough ballots came in after Election Day to change the results of the presidential race in Pennsylvania.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, asked Monday for any tangible evidence of wrongdoing, said Republicans were trying to gather affidavits from witnesses.

“All we are asking for is truth, transparency and sunlight here,” McEnany said.

Earlier in the day, an anti-abortion law center in Michigan filed suit to complain about vote counting procedures in Wayne County. An appeals court in Michigan, meanwhile, asked the Trump campaign to refile a case submitted last week, saying the appeal was incomplete.

And in Arizona, the Trump campaign asked in a lawsuit filed Saturday for the right to inspect thousands of in-person ballots filled out on Election Day in the Phoenix area, alleging that poll workers had mishandled them.

In Georgia — where Biden has a small lead over Trump but the race remains too early to call — a state election official pledged Monday to investigate any ballot problems they find.

“When the margins are this tight, every little thing matters,” said Gabriel Sterling, who led the state’s implementation of a new voting system for the secretary of state’s office.

Still, he expressed frustration over efforts to shake the public’s faith in the electoral system.

“The facts are the facts, regardless of outcomes,” Sterling said.

China gears up for world’s largest online shopping festivalBy ZEN SOOAP Technology WriterThe Associated PressHONG KONG

HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese consumers are expected to spend tens of billions on everything from fresh food to luxury goods during this year’s Singles’ Day online shopping festival, as the country recovers from the pandemic.

The shopping festival, which is the world’s largest and falls on Nov. 11 every year, is an annual extravaganza where China’s e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, offer generous discounts on their platforms. Last year, shoppers spent $38.4 billion on Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao.

This year’s festival will be closely watched as a barometer of consumption in China, which is just beginning to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic after months of lockdown earlier in the year.

Analysts expect Chinese consumers to spend more on imported products and foreign luxury brands, since many Chinese tourists were unable to travel internationally due to the coronavirus pandemic and tightened travel restrictions.

A survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that 86% of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than during last year’s Singles’ Day festival.

“In the last six months or so, wealthy households have actually spent more money,” said Sean Shen, customer and strategy competence leader for EY in Greater China. “We also see that purchases of luxury segment products are increasing because of the international travel restrictions.”

Sales of electronic goods and health and wellness products are also expected to rise, as more people work from home and pay more attention to their health amid the pandemic, according to a report by consultancy Bain & Company.

To help merchants cope with the impact from the coronavirus, online platforms have extended the shopping festival period this year in hopes of boosting sales.

Both Alibaba and JD.com, the country’s two biggest e-commerce companies, began offering discounts on Oct. 21, three weeks ahead of Nov. 11. Some brands and merchants that slashed their prices booked hundreds of millions of yuan (tens of millions of dollars) in sales just hours into the shopping festival.

Tang Chenghui, an electrical engineer who lives in Beijing sees Singles’ Day as an opportunity to stock up on snacks and imported products such as milk from Australia. Ahead of the festival, Tang pre-ordered 3 boxes of duck eggs, 10 packets of soybean milk powder, two boxes of yogurt, coffee and wine.

“I’m buying more snacks this year because I’ve just moved into a new apartment and have enough storage space to stockpile the snacks I like,” said Tang. “Some of these products are really cheap during the Singles’ Day discounts.”

Unlike Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S., Singles’ Day in China is not just about deep bargains. Alibaba pioneered the concept of Singles’ Day and holds an annual gala on Nov. 11 with celebrity performances to entertain shoppers.

E-commerce companies don’t break down Singles Day sales volume by brands so it is hard to know what share goes to foreign companies, though some companies might announce their own performances.

Sales via livestreaming and Alibaba’s annual gala are part of a “shoppertainment” trend which blends shopping with entertainment in order to become more appealing and engaging to shoppers.

Mini games within online shopping platforms entice shoppers with deeper discounts while encouraging them to spend more time within the app.

“Because of COVID-19, brands and retailers have doubled down on e-commerce and livestreaming commerce to drive growth, and it will show strongly on (Singles’ Day) this year,” said Wang Xiaofeng, a senior analyst at Forrester.

But while millions of shoppers spend hours on mini games hoping to snag better bargains, some are irked by the complexities required to win such discounts.

“Black Friday discounts tend to be better, and they are more straightforward,” said Liu Zhirou, a 27 year-old Beijing-based accountant. “Now, I still ask my friends to help me buy things from the U.S. during Black Friday.”

“The rules around Singles’ Day discounts now are getting more and more complicated,” she said. “I usually just spend my money on Black Friday, and buy less on Singles’ Day.”

The Latest: New record high for US coronavirus casesBy The Associated PressThe Associated Press

BOSTON — The U.S. has set another record for daily number of coronavirus cases.

The country reported more than 126,000 positive cases and more than 1,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University.

It marked the fourth day in a row that new cases topped more than 100,000 as the country has broken its own record for daily cases with nearly every passing day this week.

The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from more than 64,000 on Oct. 24 to nearly 104,000 on Nov. 7, according to the university’s data.

The virus death toll is also rising in the country.

The seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths rose over the past two weeks from 801 on Oct. 24 to 930 on Nov. 7, the university said.

There have been more than 9.8 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S. since the pandemic started.

Globally, there have been nearly 50 million positive cases and more than 1.2 million deaths from COVID-19.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

JERUSALEM — Israel has allowed most retail shops to reopen for the first time in nearly two months, in the latest phase of its exit from a second coronavirus lockdown.

Under the new rules, shops can accept up to four customers at a time, and indoor shopping malls remain closed.

Israel moved quickly last spring to contain the coronavirus, quickly sealing its borders and shutting down much of the economy. But it mismanaged the reopening of the economy, and the coronavirus quickly returned. A second lockdown was imposed in mid-September.

The country has moved more cautiously this time– gradually opening preschools and elementary schools and some offices in recent weeks. The dual lockdowns have hit small businesses especially hard.

Rina Shapira, a shopper in a Jerusalem bookshop, said the plight of businesses is heartbreaking. “Without an economy, there is also no health,” she said.

ROME — More than 200 migrants who reached a tiny Italian island were in mandatory preventative quarantine Sunday aboard a ferry that has been pressed into service as part of the country’s measures against COVID-19 spread.

The 238 migrants are some of about 2,200 who arrived on Lampedusa island in the past week, Italian news reports said. Among them are Tunisians who arrived in small boats directly on the island from their homeland, while some of the others were spotted by an Italian border patrol vessel, which then brought them to shore.

With tourism practically flattened by the pandemic, Italy earlier this year started using empty passenger ferries that normally would ply the waters between Sicily and the mainland to instead house migrants to ensure they don’t bring infection when they are later transferred to shelters in Italy.

While earlier in the pandemic some clusters of infections were found in migrant residences, in past weeks most of the new cases in a resurgence of COVID-19 infections have been traced to transmission within Italian households, according to health experts.

RENO, Nev. — A rural Nevada church is headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court in a second attempt to overturn the state’s 50-person cap on attendance at religious gatherings.

The high court denied Calvary Chapel Dayton Valleys’ request for an emergency injunction in July.

A new petition filed Thursday asks the justices to consider the challenge of Nevada’s COVID-19 restrictions as a test case for others brought by churches across the country arguing their religious freedoms are being violated.

Calvary Chapel argues the 50-person cap is an unconstitutional violation of religious freedoms, partly because casinos and other businesses are allowed to operate at 50% of capacity.

Other secular businesses allowed to operate at half capacity include restaurants, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys.

A federal appeals court has scheduled oral arguments next month on the Nevada church’s appeal of a U.S. judge’s ruling in Reno upholding the state policy.

NEW YORK — Students attending college at one of New York’s public universities in the spring will have to quarantine at home for a week first and be tested for COVID-19, at home or on campus.

The rules are part of new guidance for the spring semester issued by the State University of New York on Sunday.

Classes will start later than usual, on Feb. 1, and there will be no spring break. And with big gatherings still not allowed, graduation plans for the Class of 2021 are shaping up once again to be scaled-back or virtual ceremonies.

NEW DELHI — India has reported 45,674 new coronavirus infections, with the capital coping with a sharp surge of nearly 7,000 cases a day this past week.

India’s tally of confirmed cases — currently the second largest in the world behind the United States — has exceeded 8.5 million. The Health Ministry on Sunday also reported 559 deaths in the past 24 hours, raising total fatalities to 126,121.

India has seen an overall steady dip in new cases after touching nearly 100,000 a day in mid-September.

However, the tally in New Delhi continues to hover at around 7,000 a day after dropping to nearly 1,000 in September. The capital also reported 79 deaths in the past 24 hours, the most since June.

Delhi state Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that apart from aggressive contact tracing, targeted testing in shopping areas and other busy locations also has started. And authorities are reaching out to people through mobile testing vans.

The government has warned that the situation could worsen due to festival shopping crowds, coupled with the onset of winter and high air pollution levels.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska on Saturday reported hitting a daily record in new coronavirus cases.

The state reported 604 cases, the highest in a single day since Oct. 25, when 526 cases were tallied, the Anchorage Daily News reported.

The Department of Health and Social Services says there were no new deaths from the virus. The state has had 19,306 cases and 79 deaths since the coronavirus hit.

The Daily News reports that 95 people were currently hospitalized with the virus in Alaska as of Saturday, slightly down from Friday’s record of 97 hospitalizations. Another 10 hospital patients were suspected of having COVID-19, according to state data.

SANTA FE, N.M. — New Mexico on Saturday for the second day in a row reported nearly 1,300 additional COVID-19 cases and 16 additional deaths.

Officials say there are 1,287 additional cases, a one-day record that was the same number reported Friday. But officials on Saturday also said that 10 of the cases reported Friday had turned out to be duplicates or not lab-confirmed. With those adjustments and the latest reported cases, the statewide case total reached 53,671 with 1,104 deaths.

State officials warned Thursday that new records would be set over the coming weeks as the rate of spread remains high.

WICHITA, Kan. — A council member in Kansas’ largest city has tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the mayor and other council members to quarantine for about two weeks.

Wichita announced Council Member Brandon Johnson’s positive result Saturday in a tweet. The city says Mayor Brandon Whipple, members of the City Council and some staff, including city manager Robert Layton, must temporarily stay away from city hall.

“The City continues to strongly urge all Wichita residents and City employees to practice safe social distancing whenever possible, to wear face masks when distancing isn’t possible, limit public exposure and to wash hands frequently,” the City of Wichita tweeted.

The Wichita Eagle reports that Johnson said he had a cough Thursday that worsened Friday, so he went to be tested. He received his results Saturday morning.

CARSON CITY, Nev. — Nevada has reported a record number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases for the second day in row. State officials on Saturday reported 1,846 additional cases with five additional deaths.

The state reported 1,562 new cases on Friday. The state’s totals increased to 108,746 cases and 1,850 deaths. State COVID-19 response Director Caleb Cage said Friday the case increase in Nevada is a surge in cases.

According to Johns Hopkins University data analyzed by The Associated Press, seven-day rolling averages for daily new cases and daily new deaths in Nevada increased over the last two weeks as the average for COVID-19 testing positivity dropped.

HILLSBORO, Ore. — The Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating reports that a circuit court judge is endangering the health of workers and jurors by ignoring a statewide mask mandate in his courtroom.

The Oregonian/OregonianLive reports in a story on Saturday that Washington County Circuit Judge Charles Bailey describes the mask mandate as a “nanny state” requirement. He doesn’t wear a face covering and isn’t requiring others to do so in his Hillsboro courtroom. Bailey told attorneys and jurors in the Oct. 29 recording of the proceedings that it was up to them whether they wanted to wear a mask. The incident occurred as coronavirus infections surge in the state.

OKLAHOMA CITY — The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in Oklahoma on Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, but the state Department of Health said a bureaucratic backlog and duplicate reporting partially account for the steep increase.

There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks.

“We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. Officials said they were not sure how many cases were recorded twice but were investigating.

In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt, called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.

“Oklahomans pulled together back in April so we could safely reopen our economy, and I am asking for that same unified effort once again to slow the spread of this virus and keep Oklahomans safe,” Stitt said.

Erdogan accepts Turkish finance minister’s resignationThe Associated PressANKARA, Turkey

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accepted the resignation of his son-in-law from the position of finance minister, the Turkish leader’s office announced Monday.

A statement from his office said Erdogan has accepted Berat Albayrak’s request “to be excused from his duties” but didn’t say who would replace him.

Albayrak, 42, announced late on Sunday that he was stepping down for health reasons and would spend more time with his family.

The country’s battered currency firmed against the dollar on Monday following his announcement, which came after the dismissal over the weekend of central bank chief Murat Uysal and his replacement by former Finance Minister Naci Agbal.

Albayrak, who has four children with Erdogan’s daughter Esra, has presided over a rough period in the Turkish economy. The country was recovering from a currency crisis in 2018 when the coronavirus pandemic hit and Albayrak’s stewardship came under much criticism.

The Turkish lira had lost around 30% of its value since the start of the year, hitting a record low of 8.58 against the dollar on Friday, while annual inflation has hit 11.89%.

“At a time when even developed nations experienced serious economic hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic … our country suffered the minimum amount of damage during that critical time, thanks to … Albayrak’s efforts,” said the statement from Erdogan’s office.

In a statement released Monday, the new central bank chief vowed to “decisively use all policy tools in pursuit of (the central bank’s) price stability objective.”

“The central bank will assess the current situation, review expectations, monitor developments closely, ahead of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Nov. 19,” he said."

UN envoy lays lays out strategy for financing climate battleBy DANICA KIRKAAssociated PressThe Associated PressLONDON

LONDON (AP) — The U.N.’s special envoy for climate change on Monday laid out a strategy for financing efforts to cut carbon emissions, calling on companies to be more transparent about their efforts and the impact rising temperatures will have on their operations.

Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, said 126 countries have committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, and investors overseeing more than $140 trillion are demanding that companies do more to assess the risks and opportunities of climate change. But, he said, more needs to be done to secure the trillions of dollars in private investment needed to slow the rise in global temperatures.

Carney’s speech to financial leaders in London comes as the U.K. prepares to host the next U.N. climate summit, known as COP26, a year from now in Glasgow. The summit’s goal is to ensure the world meets the Paris climate accord’s goal of limiting global temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

“When the world’s governments set the goal of net zero and over $100 trillion of capital are demanding action, at a minimum, major companies need to disclose whether the assumptions in their financial accounts are aligned with Paris,” Carney said. “In other words, are they joining us on the Road to Glasgow or not?’’

The comments come at a crucial moment for climate campaigners. The U.S., which withdrew from the Paris Agreement under President Donald Trump, is expected to rejoin the accord once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

Carney has long championed the notion that making companies accountable for their impact on the planet is the first step toward reducing greenhouse gases.

He said Monday that companies need to go further by disclosing the risks climate change poses to their businesses and their plans for the future. Investors such as banks, insurance companies and investment funds should also disclose how their choices are aligned with climate goals, he said.

“Over time, investors won’t just judge company transition plans, they too shall be judged,’’ Carney said.

Later Monday, the U.K.’s Treasury chief, Rishi Sunak, said he would force British companies to reveal the impact they are having on the environment as the country moves to meet a net zero target by 2050. Companies will have until 2025 to get in line with the rules.

He also announced plans for “green sovereign bonds,” in hopes to position the U.K. as the hub of green finance before COP-26.

Carney also called for the creation of new markets, particularly in carbon offsets, to facilitate investment in the projects needed to meet climate goals, the most cost-effective of which are in the developing world.

Carbon offsets occur when a polluter pays someone else to reduce their emissions, then receives credit for those reductions. These credits can then be used to offset the polluter’s own emissions, reducing net releases into the atmosphere.

While demand for such offsets is likely to soar as more companies commit to net-zero emissions, this market “barely exists,” Carney said.

“Climate change is a global challenge. Much of the critical investment will take place in emerging and developing economies,” Carney said. “For this to happen, we need to turn billions of public capital into trillions of private capital."

Trump books will continue after Trump leaves officeBy HILLEL ITALIEAP National WriterThe Associated PressNEW YORK

NEW YORK (AP) — One of publishing’s most thriving genres of the past four years, books about President Donald Trump, is not going to end when he leaves office.

In 2021 and beyond, look for waves of releases about the Trump administration and about the president’s loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Works already planned include the anti-Trump “Preventable: The Inside Story of How Leadership Failures, Politics, and Selfishness Doomed the U.S. Coronavirus Response,” by former Obamacare head Andy Slavitt. There’s a campaign book from New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns. And former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is reportedly working on a memoir.

Expect detailed condemnations of the 45th president’s actions and rhetoric, from journalists and former associates, and also flattering accounts from White House allies and pro-Trump pundits. And there might well be a book from Trump himself, who received more than 70 million votes even as he became the first president in nearly 30 years to be defeated after one term.

“It was a very controversial presidency and the New York publishing world isn’t exactly packed with Trump fans,” says Matt Latimer of the Javelin literary agency, where clients have included former FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Fox host Tucker Carlson.

“But there are tens of millions of Americans who look to the Trump presidency as an important time and are fans of his administration. At least some publishers will recognize that.”

Publishers often speak proudly about their openness to diverse voices, while also acknowledging that they like to make money. Several houses have conservative imprints that over the past few years have acquired books by everyone from Sean Hannity to Corey Lewandowski.

Simon & Schuster is Hillary Clinton’s longtime publisher, but through its conservative Threshold Editions released Trump’s most recent work, “Crippled America,” which came out in 2015. Center Street, a Hachette Book Group imprint, has published Donald Trump Jr., Newt Gingrich and Judge Jeanine Pirro among others.

“No matter their political beliefs, every American has personally experienced the seismic shift within Washington,” Center Street publisher Daisy Blackwell Hutton said in a statement. “Books will be published for years to come about his presidency and the conservative movement in general, and Center Street absolutely intends to be a leader in that space.”

There are risks in publishing Trump, although even presidents who have left office highly unpopular, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, managed to get book deals and release bestsellers. None were as polarizing as Trump or have so many upcoming legal battles, including a New York State investigation into his finances, and a defamation lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll, one of more than 20 women who have alleged sexual assault or misconduct by Trump.

Several publishers told the AP that they don’t believe Trump will have the same global appeal as former President Barack Obama, whose “A Promised Land” comes out next week. Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, agreed to a reported $65 million deal with Crown in 2017.

Any publisher signing with Trump or a top administration official might face the anger not just of Trump critics among the general public, but from within the industry. When Simon & Schuster signed up the far right journalist-commentator Milo Yiannopoulos in 2017, more than 100 authors publicly objected. (The publisher ended up dropping him amid allegations he approved of sex between men and young boys.) Hachette cancelled a memoir by Woody Allen, whose daughter Dylan Farrow has alleged he sexually abused her, after employees staged a walkout in protest. (Skyhorse Publishing later released the book).

Ellen Oh, an author of fantasy novels who co-founded the grassroots organization We Need Diverse Books, mentioned three of the most controversial Trump appointees: Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and senior advisor Stephen Miller. “I would campaign hard against these three officials who have done the most damage under Trump,” said Oh, who was among those who signed the Yiannapoulos letter.

David Drake, executive vice president and publisher of Crown, which will release Obama’s memoir, declined comment on whether he would acquire a book by Trump or even meet with him. The executive vice president and publisher of Alfred A. Knopf, Reagan Arthur, doubted she would sign up Trump, but added that she would probably agree to meet with him, out of courtesy to a former president.

Dana Canedy, senior vice president and publisher of Simon & Schuster’s namesake imprint, said any decision to work with Trump or those in his Cabinet would depend on what they were planning to say.

“I would apply the same rigorous approach to any meeting, with anyone, Democratic or Republican,” she said. “I would have to see whether there’s an arc to the story, how deeply reported it would be, and that there would be fact-checking so we could be confident about it. And that’s whether Joe Biden was coming to me or Donald Trump was coming to me.”

Canedy said she might be interested in a book from Trump about his influence on the Republican Party, which initially resisted his rise in 2016. She would want Trump, or any author, to be “fair, balanced and honest,” and have ”a level of insight and self-awareness.”

Asked if she believed Trump could meet those standards, Canedy said: “I wouldn’t know how to answer that, quite honestly, because I would need to see the proposal first.”

The switch from a Republican to a Democratic president also should result in a shift on best-seller lists. The past four years have seen a continuous run of anti-Trump blockbusters, including Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury,” Comey’s “A Higher Loyalty,” Mary Trump’s “Too Much and Never Enough,” and Bob Woodward’s “Fear” and “Rage.”

The next four years should mark the dawn of books against Biden.

“It’s historically been our experience that books coming from the right are more available and more popular when there is a Democratic presidency,” says Adrian Zackheim, who runs the conservative Sentinel imprint at Penguin Random House and has published books by Mike Huckabee, Nikki Haley and Brian Kilmeade among others. “That is pretty much a scientific fact.”"

Refusing to concede, Trump blocks cooperation on transitionBy JONATHAN LEMIRE and ZEKE MILLERAssociated PressThe Associated PressWASHINGTON

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration threw the presidential transition into tumult on Monday, with President Donald Trump blocking government officials from cooperating with President-elect Joe Biden’s team and Attorney General William Barr authorizing the Justice Department to probe unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.

Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, rallied behind Trump’s efforts to fight the election results. Few in the GOP acknowledged Biden’s victory or condemned Trump’s other concerning move on Monday: his firing of Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

The developments cast doubt on whether the nation would witness the same kind of smooth transition of power that has long anchored its democracy. The Electoral College is slated to formally confirm Biden’s victory on Dec. 14 and the Democrat will be sworn into office in late January.

On Monday, Barr authorized U.S. attorneys to probe “substantial” allegations of voter irregularities and election fraud, though no widespread instances of that type of trouble in the 2020 election exist. In fact, election officials from both political parties have publicly stated that voting went well and international observers also confirmed that there were no serious irregularities.

Biden campaign lawyer Bob Bauer said Barr’s memorandum authorizing investigations “will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against.”

Biden pressed forward with plans to build out his administration, assembling a team of experts to face the surging pandemic. But the federal agency that needs to greenlight the beginnings of the transition of power held off on taking that step. And the White House moved to crack down on those not deemed sufficiently loyal as Trump continued to refuse to concede the race.

Trump remained out of sight at the White House, with conversations ongoing about how the defeated president would spend the coming days and weeks as he challenged the people’s verdict. Trump is not expected to formally concede but is likely to grudgingly vacate the White House at the end of his term, according to several people around him.

Also being discussed: the possibility of more campaign-style rallies as he tries to keep his supporters fired up despite his defeat. It was possible they would feature his family and top supporters but not the president himself.

The ouster of Esper, the Pentagon chief, was expected by some aides to be the first of several firings by Trump, now freed from having to face voters again and angry at those in his administration perceived to be insufficiently loyal. Others believed to be vulnerable: FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA head Gina Haspel and infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The president was given cover to keep fighting by McConnell, seen by many in the GOP as the one who may eventually need to nudge Trump to the exit.

“Our institutions are actually built for this,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate on Monday. “We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer countered that the Republicans’ refusal to accept the election results was “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy.”

“Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” Schumer said.

A few other GOP senators sent tepid nods toward a transition. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska offered congratulations to Biden, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine noted the Democrat’s “apparent victory.” But many Republican lawmakers were reluctant to speak up about the election, seeing little political incentive to take a firm stance on Trump’s transition from the White House.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have been hesitant to push Trump to concede to Biden, knowing it would anger their base of Trump’s most devoted supporters. Most were also not overtly encouraging the president’s unfounded claims of fraud, while allowing baseless questions about the election process to linger.

Adding to the sense of uncertainty, the General Services Administration held off on formally beginning the transition, preventing Biden’s teams from gaining access to federal agencies. An agency spokesperson said late Monday that an “ascertainment” on the winner of the election had not yet been made. Citing what the agency did during the extended 2000 electoral recount, it signaled that it may not do so until Trump concedes or the Electoral College meets next month.

That Florida recount involved a margin of just 537 votes in the one state that would have determined which candidate reached 270 electoral votes. Biden’s leads across Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which pushed him over the threshold to win the White House, are far more substantial — and greater than Trump’s leads in the same states in 2016.

On a call Monday night with reporters, a transition official said the Biden team believes it is time for the GSA administrator to ascertain that Biden is president-elect. The official, who spoke only on anonymity as a ground rule for the call, said legal action is “certainly a possibility” if that doesn’t happen, though there are also other options being considered.

Across government, there were signs of a slowdown.

White House officials and Trump political appointees informed career government staffers they were not to begin acting on transition planning until GSA approved it, according to officials familiar with the matter.

In weekly Monday morning all-hands phone calls for Midwest-based employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, mid-level administrators responded to questions about the transition by telling staffers they had no information yet, said Nicole Cantello, an agency employee and president of the Chicago local of a union representing EPA workers.

A senior administration official said presidential personnel director John McEntee, the president’s former personal aide, has sent word to departments that they should terminate any political appointees seeking new work for now. Another official said the warning was not seen as likely to result in any firings but rather meant to reinforce to staff that they should not act counter to Trump while he refuses to concede. Those officials and others who were not authorized to discuss internal policies or describe private discussions requested anonymity.

But some elements of the federal government already were mobilizing to prepare for Biden to assume power. The U.S. Secret Service and Federal Aviation Administration extended a flight restriction over Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, home through Inauguration Day. Biden’s security detail has been bolstered with agents from the Presidential Protective Division.

And despite Trump’s public stance, there was a growing realization in his inner circle that the election result would be impossible to overturn. Some senior officials have tried to make the case that Trump should turn his efforts to cementing his legacy, but they are wary of being labeled disloyal for even thinking it.

Legal challenges already have been dismissed in battleground states like Georgia and Wisconsin. And Trump’s legal efforts were dealt another blow Monday when campaign adviser David Bossie, tasked with leading the effort, tested positive for the coronavirus.

Bossie had been at the indoor White House election night party now being perceived as a possible superspreader event after other attendees — including chief of staff Mark Meadows, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson and other aides — contracted the virus.

At the White House, attendance among aides had dropped off since election night — partly because of the result and partly because a number are in quarantine after contracting or being exposed to people who came down with COVID-19. Vice President Mike Pence was slated to depart Tuesday for a vacation in Florida after a visit to Capitol Hill.

Trump’s public schedule hasn’t included an intelligence briefing since Oct. 1. The White House hasn’t provided a “readout” of any call between the president and a foreign leader in weeks. He hasn’t met with members of the White House coronavirus task force in months. He also offered no public comment on Tropical Storm Eta lashing the Florida Keys.

The drawn-out resolution to the election has only added to the culture of suspicion that has permeated the hollowed-out West Wing.

US allows 1st emergency use of a COVID-19 antibody drugBy MATTHEW PERRONEAP Health WriterThe Associated PressWASHINGTON

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials have allowed emergency use of the first antibody drug to help the immune system fight COVID-19, an experimental approach against the virus that has killed more than 238,000 Americans.

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared the experimental drug from Eli Lilly for people 12 and older with mild or moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization. It’s a one-time treatment given through an IV.

The therapy is still undergoing additional testing to establish its safety and effectiveness. It is similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month.

Lilly’s studies of the antibody drug are continuing. Early results suggest it may help clear the coronavirus sooner and possibly cut hospitalizations in people with mild to moderate COVID-19. A study of it in hospitalized patients was stopped when independent monitors saw the drug did not seem to be helping in that situation.

The government previously reached an agreement to buy and supply much of the early production of Lilly’s drug.

Only one drug — Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir — has full FDA approval for treating COVID-19. Government treatment guidelines also back using dexamethasone and other steroids for certain severely ill, hospitalized patients.

One other treatment has an emergency use designation now — convalescent plasma, or the blood of COVID-19 survivors. No large studies have shown it to be more effective than usual care alone, however.

The new drug is part of an emerging family of biologic therapies that offer a promising new approach to preventing serious disease and death from COVID-19. Experts say the infused drugs could serve as a therapeutic bridge to help manage the virus until vaccines are widely available.

The drugs are laboratory-made versions of antibodies, blood proteins which the body creates to help target and eliminate foreign infections. The new therapies are concentrated versions of the antibodies that proved most effective against the virus in patient studies.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. also has asked for emergency authorization for an antibody drug it is testing, the one Trump received.

FDA regulators authorized the Lilly drug using their emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs and other medical products during public health crises.

In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” to show that a drug is safe and effective, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can lower those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.

The emergency authorization functions like a temporary approval for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. To win full approval, Lilly will have to submit additional research to fully define the drug’s safety and benefit for patients.

The government has signed an agreement with Lilly to spend $375 million to buy 300,000 vials of the drug. How many doses that would provide is unclear. Each vial contains 70 milligrams and that dose proved ineffective in the early results. It took four times that amount — 2,800 milligrams — to show any effect.

The Lilly drug is authorized for people 12 and older who weigh at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions.

Notre Dame mandates virus testing after football celebrationBy CASEY SMITHAssociated Press/Report for AmericaThe Associated PressINDIANAPOLIS

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — University of Notre Dame students are now subject to mandatory coronavirus testing and face strict penalties if they leave town before getting their test results after thousands of fans stormed the football field and threw parties to celebrate a double-overtime upset over Clemson.

The mass of students, players and coaches crammed close together on the field in the minutes following the Fighting Irish’s 47-40 win Saturday night in South Bend, Indiana, over then-No. 1 Clemson. Many were not wearing masks or had them pulled down.

All Notre Dame students are required to undergo coronavirus testing before they leave South Bend for the extended winter break, Notre Dame President the Rev. John Jenkins told students in an email Sunday night. Jenkins didn’t specifically reference the storming of the field, but rather “many gatherings” over the weekend.

If a student is exposed or tests positive, they will be required to quarantine on campus for two weeks. If students don’t complete the mandatory coronavirus test — or if they leave before they receive their test results — they will be prevented from registering for classes, university officials said.

The campus has also introduced a zero-tolerance rule for gatherings that do not follow safety guidelines. Any student hosting a large gathering will face “severe sanctions.”

“As exciting as last night’s victory against Clemson was, it was very disappointing to see evidence of widespread disregard of our health protocols at many gatherings over the weekend,” Jenkins said in his letter. In addition to the game, numerous parties were held across campus.

Following the win, Notre Dame moved up two spots to No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll, while Clemson dropped to No. 4.

The celebration came just two days after Jenkins released a video warning students about spikes in COVID-19 cases on campus and imploring them to redouble their efforts to follow safety measures. Notre Dame reported 24 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, with 220 active cases overall. The university has reported 1,355 positive cases since the start of the fall semester.

Jenkins has come under criticism in recent weeks after he failed to wear a mask at a White House Rose Garden ceremony at which President Donald Trump introduced Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. Jenkins, who tested positive for COVID-19 days later, shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others at the event.

Jenkins later apologized, admitting he had “failed to lead by example.” Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in his actions in a resolution passed Thursday.

Kristi Noem has enthusiastically taken up President Donald Trump’s efforts to contest the results of the presidential election

Noem’s pitch to aid Trump seems to benefit own campaign fundBy STEPHEN GROVESAssociated PressThe Associated PressSIOUX FALLS, S.D.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has enthusiastically taken up President Donald Trump’s efforts to contest the results of the presidential election, asking for online donations to “help us bring it home for the president,” but it appears the donations are set to flow into her own reelection account.

The Republican governor, a close Trump ally, launched a fundraising campaign soon after the election was called for Biden on Saturday. The website soliciting donations has “Kristi Noem for Governor” in large letters at the top, but below that, the message is all about Trump, saying that he “needs our support while the far-left Dems declare a victory for Biden before all the votes are counted.” It urges donors to “Please help us bring it home for the president!”

The site allows contributors to check the amount of their donation and includes a box to cover a processing “so 100% of my donation goes to Kristi for Governor.”

Noem, who was first elected in 2018 and would be up for reelection in 2022, did not respond to a request for comment on how the money raised would be used. Her campaign committee chairman, Steve Kirby, said he had no comment on how the funds would be used.

It’s unlikely that much, if any, of the money will end up going to Trump, said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause, a campaign finance watchdog. Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer, pointed out that the governor can give a maximum of $2,800 to Trump’s campaign under federal law. If she wanted more to flow to Trump, she could have directed donors to the president’s own donation site.

“In all likelihood, she is keeping this money that she is raising,” Ryan said. “If she were actually interested in raising money for Donald Trump’s own legal efforts, she would use a joint-fundraising committee.”

Federal election law makes it difficult for state campaign committees like Noem’s to donate to federal campaigns because it would have to ensure the donations it receives meet federal contribution limits.

Ryan compared Noem’s solicitation to Trump’s current fundraising push. Trump’s solicitation, though billed as raising money for his legal fight, notes that half of contributions will go to pay off general election campaign debt.

“He’s setting the example at the top of the party, at the top of the ticket,” Ryan said. “It doesn’t surprise me to see Noem doing something similar.”

Noem has emerged as a conservative star during Trump’s campaign, with her travels to presidential proving grounds like New Hampshire and Iowa fueling speculation that she is eyeing a 2024 run.

The national attention has helped her fill up a campaign war chest, amassing more donations in the two weeks leading up to Election Day than she did in the first five months of the year. She has raised more than $1 million in contributions to her gubernatorial campaign in the last six months.

The Republican governor has increasingly seized on national hot-button issues. Last week, she furthered Trump’s allegations of widespread voter fraud by tweeting that election systems were “rigged,” even as votes were still being tallied. No evidence of such fraud has yet emerged.

Trump has made an aggressive pitch to donors to help finance lawsuits and encouraged supporters to rally against accepting the results of the election.

Noem has made it clear she will take up Trump’s fight. In a Sunday appearance on ABC News, she said, “When you break the process on which we elect our leaders, you will break America forever. So this isn’t just about this election, this is about every election in the future.”"

Mahomes piles up big numbers at Arrowhead – on Election DayBy ARNIE STAPLETONAP Pro Football WriterThe Associated Press

Patrick Mahomes piled up some very big numbers at Arrowhead Stadium last week.

Twice.

Five days before throwing for four touchdowns and nearly 400 yards in the Kansas City Chiefs’ 33-31 victory over the Carolina Panthers, Mahomes helped turn his home stadium into a giant polling place on Election Day.

When Missouri couldn’t figure out a way to pay for a polling station at Arrowhead Stadium, the Chiefs and their star quarterback chipped in the six figures necessary to cover the cost of 40 voting machines and other necessities that allowed Jackson County residents to vote there.

“I thought it was very important. Not only just to get as many people out to vote as possible, but also to use a place (such) as Arrowhead where we have a lot of fun, show a lot of love and unity with people coming together, and use it as a place where we can come together to vote and use our voice,” Mahomes told the “ Huddle & Flow ” podcast with Jim Trotter and Steve Wyche.

Chiefs president Mark Donovan and head coach Andy Reid were among the first to vote at Arrowhead on Tuesday.

Mahomes, who filled out an absentee ballot from Texas, said he voted for the first time in his life, as did Denver Broncos star linebacker Von Miller, who is recovering from ankle surgery.

Miller went on Instagram Live on the eve of the election to tell Sen. Cory Booker (D.-New Jersey) that he decided to cast his ballot after a heart-to-heart conversation with Broncos running backs coach Curtis Modkins.

“I just wanted to let my voice be heard,” Miller told Booker. “We’ve been fighting for the right to vote for years and years and one of my coaches, Coach Modkins, he sat down with us and we had a team meeting and we talked about how important it is to vote no matter who is on the ballot.

“Our people have been fighting for years and years and years for this right. And, we owe it to them to go out there and vote. That really just struck me and that was really the wave that pushed me over the top to go out there and exercise my voice.”

The NFL and its players union announced last week that following their joint efforts through NFL Votes and #AthleteAndVoter nonpartisan initiatives, 90% of active players were registered to vote in this year’s election and half the league’s stadiums were used as early voting or Election Day polling sites.

Among the other notable calls of Week 9 were a ruling by the officials that helped turn the tide in the Baltimore Ravens’ 24-10 win at Indianapolis and NFL receiver-turned-broadcaster Brandon Stokley calling out several Denver Broncos players for complaining about getting booed at home a week earlier.

CURIOUS CALL

With the Colts clinging to a 10-7 lead early in the third quarter, Philip Rivers’ deep pass to Marcus Johnson was broken up by cornerback Marcus Peters. Only, the officials ruled Peters made an interception at midfield before fumbling the ball, which safety Chuck Clark smothered at the Baltimore 46.

Ten plays later, the Ravens went ahead for good when running back Gus Edwards took it in from the 1 to put them up 14-10.

Rivers was still miffed after the game at how the replay officials could have ruled it an interception and fumble instead of a simple pass breakup.

“It’s gotten so jacked up how the catch rule is,” Rivers said. “I mean, nobody that’s played any amount of football or that’s been around the game … thought that was a catch — including the guy that dropped it. But you can slow it down to milliseconds and you just make it a technicality.”

Baltimore’s first win in Indianapolis helped extend its league-high road winning streak to 10 and ended a stretch of 20 consecutive losses when trailing at halftime.

BOO HOO

Before Denver’s 31-30 comeback win over the Chargers last week, fans at Empower Field booed the players off the field at halftime and again when Los Angeles extended its lead to 24-3 midway through the third quarter.

Among the Broncos who took offense to the catcalls from the sparse crowd of 5,231 in the 76,000-seat stadium were Drew Lock and Dalton Risner, who were visibly upset by the boo-birds, and Phillip Lindsay, who said afterward, “It’s hard to go out there and play for negative fans.”

Coach Vic Fangio didn’t like hearing the griping, saying paying customers have the right to voice their displeasure when the product is less than worthy of the price of a ticket.

“That’s just part of pro sports,” Fangio said. “Sometimes it’s harsher than others — me and my Philadelphia roots know all about that. I think it’s better left alone. The fans pay the money, they can boo if they want.”

Stokley, who has an afternoon show with Zach Bye on 104.3 The Fan in Denver, agreed wholeheartedly with Fangio’s take.

“If players don’t like fans booing them then how about just play better. It’s pretty simple,” Stokley tweeted. “Don’t be mad at paying customers when the product stinks and they are upset about what they’re watching. It’s been 3 1/2 years of bad ball. Not just one half.”

Trebek brought consensus, class to a nation in need of bothBy ANDREW DALTONAP Entertainment WriterThe Associated PressLOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES (AP) — In a politically torn, culturally divided and socially splintered America, there was one thing nearly everyone could agree on: Alex Trebek was awesome.

For 36 years, the “Jeopardy!” host was a figure of consensus in an era that increasingly lacked it, and he died at the end of an election week when those divisions were in full force.

At a time when emotions, opinions and personal details feel like they’re at the center of every broadcast, post and podcast, the exceedingly Canadian Trebek held them all in check, instead valuing formality and factuality, dignity and decorum.

He was surprisingly frank with fans about his nearly two-year struggle with pancreatic cancer before his death Sunday at his home in Los Angeles at age 80. But he gave health updates in a series of polite and formal videos that were typically Trebek, speaking calmly, directly and frankly about the disease and his gratitude for the support he was getting.

Six nights a week for 36 years, after the evening news and before the firebrands of primetime cable opinion shows, Trebek brought together liberals and conservatives, city dwellers and rural folk, grandparents and grandchildren for a half-hour of brainy exercise.

His style was all facts with a touch of fun, and no politics, religion or opinion, unless they came in the form of a question in the course of the quiz show.

“I have a family with a, let’s say, wildly diverse set of political beliefs,” NBC News reporter Ben Collins said on Twitter after Trebek’s death. “Everybody in my life loves Alex Trebek. Everybody. What a life.”

With his flawless delivery of clues about Shakespeare, chemistry and world capitals, he allowed families to geek out with him, and each other.

“Growing up, he made me feel like my nerdiness was valuable and I loved learning from watching jeopardy,” TV personality and author Padma Lakshmi said on Twitter, one of scores of people paying tribute to Trebek. “It was our family’s nightly pleasure.”

Trebek himself came in the form of a question.

He revealed next-to-nothing about his private life, emotions or opinions.

That sense of mystery surrounding him was part of his appeal. He was the composed college professor whose students endlessly speculated about what he was like when class was over.

There were beloved game show hosts before Trebek, but the job for decades had cultural connotations of a smarmy talking head or a clownish emcee.

Trebek gave the role a gravitas, and a virtuosity, that didn’t seem possible before him.

“Alex was the Sinatra of our business,” Wink Martindale, a longtime host of several games shows, said in a statement. “The word class defined him. In my view, there will never be another with such multiple talents.”

Trebek was more a maestro than an emcee, conducting the high-tempo symphony of “Jeopardy!,” elegantly squeezing a world’s worth of trivia into the 13 minutes of game time in each episode.

He was a more typical figure earlier in his career, a swinging, mustachioed man’s man who owned race horses, rolled on TV’s “Celebrity Bowling” and hosted several game shows including “High Rollers” and “Battlestars.”

But when he settled into the sole role of hosting “Jeopardy!,” the most serious, intellectual and highbrow of game shows, it helped forge him into the high-class figure of class he became. He would win five Emmys and a prestigious Peabody Award, a prize usually reserved for serious TV news personalities.

He shaved his signature mustache in 2001, and increasingly became a warm, grandfatherly figure for viewers.

He wasn’t all warmth, though. Viewers loved it when he showed his sharper edges.

Some thought he showed a bit of funny condescension when he explained the correct answer to a wrong contestant — though he insisted he never knew all the answers — or when he gave a “good for you!” to contestants who shared especially banal personal stories during the mid-show chat break.

And his formality made him fodder for comedy.

Will Ferrell on “Saturday Night Live” played Trebek as a composed man who was constantly having his patience driven to the limit by impossible contestants, especially Sean Connery, on “Celebrity Jeopardy!” (The real Connery died just over a week before Trebek.)

In the social media era, Trebek became the subject of many a viral video.

One compiled his stiff attempts at showing a bit of rhythm and soul when reading the rap lyrics that came in “Jeopardy!” clues.

Another was a supercut of him saying the word “genre,” with impeccable French pronunciation. (Trebek’s mother was French-Canadian.)

When the word came up in a subsequent show, Trebek added a “yes, I said it,” as if to tell viewers, “I know what you’re all saying about me when you think I’m not listening.”

He usually was savvy enough to be in on the joke.

In a famous exchange during the original run of the show’s greatest champion, Ken Jennings, Trebek delivered a clue:

“This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral pleasure seeker.”

Jennings responded, “What is a hoe?”

As the audience began to titter, Trebek told Jennings, “Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. They teach you that in school in Utah, huh?”

Trebek immediately snapped back into the show’s rhythm, as he always did, as another contestant gave the correct response, “What is a rake?”

Everyone agrees Trebek is irreplaceable. The show has given no indication of any host plans, and has not used guest hosts during Trebek’s illness. Viewers will get a good bit more Trebek through episodes he has already taped, and through well over three decades of reruns.

Some have speculated that Jennings, who became a consulting producer on the show this season, would be the most suitable replacement.

But on Sunday, Jennings was just another of Trebek’s countless admirers.

“Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did,” he said on Twitter. “He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I’m grateful for every minute I got to spend with him.”

McCarrick: What’s known about the abusive US ex-cardinalBy NICOLE WINFIELDAssociated PressThe Associated PressROME

ROME (AP) — The Vatican on Tuesday will release its report into the rise and fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the once-influential American cardinal who was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of rumors that he was a sexual predator.

The McCarrick scandal is different from other cases of clergy abuse, primarily because there is evidence that Vatican and U.S. church leaders knew of his penchant for bedding seminarians but turned a blind eye as McCarrick rose to the top of the U.S. church as an adept fundraiser who advised three popes.

When McCarrick’s crimes were revealed, the scandal sparked such a crisis of confidence in the church’s U.S. and Vatican hierarchies that Francis approved new procedures to investigate bishops accused of abuse in a bid to end decades of impunity for Catholic leaders.

But beyond that, the McCarrick case has forced the Vatican to acknowledge that adults can be victims of sexual abuse, too. The Vatican has long tried to paint any sexual relations between priests and adult men or women as consensual, focusing its prevention policies on protecting minors.

But as a bishop, McCarrick held all the power in his relationships with his seminarians: to refuse his sexual advances or report his misconduct could have spelled an end to their priestly vocations and careers in the church. The Vatican’s new policies, enacted as a response to the McCarrick scandal, spell out that abuse can happen when anyone is forced “to perform or submit to sexual acts” through abuses of authority by church leaders.

Here is what we know about the McCarrick case ahead of the release of the Vatican report:

___

WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT?

The archdiocese of New York announced on June 20, 2018 that it had determined that an allegation that McCarrick sexually molested a minor was “credible and substantiated.” The allegation was lodged by a former altar boy who said McCarrick fondled him when he was a teenager during preparations for Christmas Mass in St. Patrick’s Cathedral in 1971 and 1972. The allegation was the first against McCarrick involving a minor, and as such triggered the investigation.

On the same day, McCarrick’s former dioceses of Newark and Metuchen, New Jersey, revealed they had settled two of three allegations of sexual misconduct by McCarrick involving adults in 2005 and 2007. Subsequently, James Grein came forward detailing the abuse he suffered at the hands of McCarrick, a family friend, starting when he was 11. Other former seminarians have since described the harassment and abuse they endured while “Uncle Ted,” as McCarrick liked to call himself, was their bishop in New Jersey, forced to sleep in his bed during weekend trips to his beach house.

McCarrick, 90, was defrocked last year after the Vatican determined he sexually abused adults and children, including during confession.

___

MCCARRICK’S RESPONSE

McCarrick has said he was innocent of the fondling accusation but accepted the pope’s sanctions.

“While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people,” he said in a statement June 20, 2018 after the initial fondling allegations were substantiated.

In a 2008 email McCarrick sent to the Vatican, he denied ever having sexual relations with anyone but said he had shown an “unfortunate lack of judgment” for having shared his bed with seminarians.

___

VIGANO’S BOMBSHELL:

The McCarrick scandal took on greater dimensions on Aug. 26, 2018 when the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, published an 11-page expose accusing two dozen U.S. and Vatican churchmen by name of knowing about McCarrick’s misconduct since at least 2000 and hiding it. Vigano cited the case of one former seminarian who in 1994 wrote a lengthy letter to his bishop detailing McCarrick’s sexual abuse of him and others — a document that would have been turned over to the Vatican at the very least in 2004 when the man was defrocked.

Vigano demanded Francis resign, saying he had told the pope in 2013 during one of their first meetings that McCarrick has “corrupted generations of seminarians and priests, and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” Vigano claimed that Francis rehabilitated McCarrick from Benedict’s sanctions and turned him into a trusted adviser.

___

VATICAN’S RESPONSE

Francis initially refused to comment, but later authorized a Vatican investigation into its archives to determine who knew what and when about McCarrick, the result of which is being released Tuesday.

In 2019, Francis told Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he didn’t know anything about McCarrick’s past and didn’t remember if Vigano had raised the issue with him when they met in 2013.

In addition, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, head of the Congregation for Bishops, confirmed McCarrick had been subject to disciplinary measures for uncorroborated “rumors” of misconduct but said the Vatican’s decision for him to live a discreet life of prayer stopped short of binding canonical sanctions because the rumors lacked proof. Ouellet accused Vigano of mounting a “blasphemous” political hit job against Francis.

___

FURTHER REVELATIONS

A former McCarrick aide, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo, in May 2019 released excerpts of correspondence that show McCarrick was placed under written Vatican restrictions in 2008 for sleeping with seminarians, but regularly flouted them with the apparent knowledge of Vatican officials under Benedict and Francis. The correspondence shows McCarrick traveled widely during Benedict’s papacy after the restrictions were purportedly imposed, including to regular meetings at the Vatican, to Bosnia, Lebanon, Qatar, Ireland and throughout Asia — travel that continued under Francis, including to China.

After the scandal broke in 2018, photos and videos surfaced of McCarrick appearing at gala benefits — even alongside Vigano, who as the Vatican ambassador in Washington would have been responsible for enforcing any restrictions on McCarrick alongside the then-archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.

In December 2019, the Washington Post reported that McCarrick gave more than $600,000 in donations from a personal fund he controlled to powerful clerics in the U.S. and Vatican, including those who had a say in whether to investigate him. The payments underscored the common tradition among well-funded bishops and religious superiors to curry favor in the Vatican with checks.

McCarrick also helped funnel millions of dollars to three popes via the U.S. Papal Foundation, which he helped co-found to raise money from wealthy American Catholics for specific works of papal charity.

The Latest: International observers see no fraud in US voteThe Associated PressWASHINGTON

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President-elect Joe Biden (all times local):

9 p.m.

International observers from the Organization of American States say they saw no instances of fraud or voting irregularities in the U.S. presidential election.

The delegation included 28 experts and observers from 13 countries who observed the election process in in Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and the District of Columbia. COVID-19 prevented a broader coalition of experts.

The OAS says the Election Day was peaceful, although there were efforts to intimate poll workers as the votes were counted, and says the country’s mail-in ballots were a secure system.

The report says the OAS supports “the right of all contesting parties in an election, to seek redress before the competent legal authorities when they believe they have been wronged.”

“It is critical however, that candidates act responsibly by presenting and arguing legitimate claims before the courts, not unsubstantiated or harmful speculation in the public media,” the OAS says.

7:15 p.m.

President-elect Joe Biden is planning to deliver a speech defending the Obama administration’s signature health care law amid a case before the Supreme Court that could overturn it.

Biden will speak on the Affordable Care Act from Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday. He campaigned for months on the law, arguing that President Donald Trump and top Republicans opposed it and therefore wanted to wipe out its mandated health insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions even though they had no alternative to replace it.

A lawsuit challenging the law is being considered by the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority after Trump’s appointment of Amy Coney Barrett.

Biden and other top Democrats tried to make last week’s election a referendum on health care, which helped the party have a strong midterm election in 2018. But Democrats failed to win control of the Senate and lost House seats this cycle, despite Biden’s win.

Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president and has promised to build on the law to allow more people to opt into government-sponsored coverage while others can keep their current, employer-based systems.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:

5:10 p.m.

Georgia’s secretary of state is firing back at the state’s two U.S. senators for calling on him to resign over the handling of the election, which has President-elect Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump in the state.

Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue took the extraordinary step Monday of calling for Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to step down.

Raffensperger responded, “Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me.”

He says while he understands their frustration with the outcome of the election — which also saw Loeffler and Perdue forced into runoffs — the way the election was handled was a success.

Raffensperger says, “As a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the U.S. Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on that.”

The Associated Press hasn’t yet called a winner in Georgia’s presidential election. The state hasn’t gone to a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992.

___

4:30 p.m.

Some Republicans are renewing their attacks on President-elect Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump in Georgia, with Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler taking the extraordinary step of calling for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state.

Republicans laid out a strategy to investigate but still presented no evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the balloting, saying Monday that they were still looking into ways to overturn Biden’s lead of more than 10,000 votes in Georgia.

Georgia is one front in a nationwide scramble by Trump forces to question his national defeat. The Associated Press has not yet called the race for Georgia’s 16 electoral votes.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office is defending the conduct of the elections, saying that while there may be scattered illegal votes, officials are very confident in the overall outcome.

Loeffler and Perdue, who face a pair of Jan. 5 runoffs against Democrats that will determine control of the Senate, blamed Raffensperger for “mismanagement and lack of transparency.”

___

2:20 p.m.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is congratulating President-elect Joe Biden on an “apparent victory” but adding that President Donald Trump should be afforded the chance to challenge the results.

Collins won reelection last week over Democrat Sara Gideon. She asked voters who have questions about the results of the presidential election to be patient.

“First, I would offer my congratulations to President-elect Biden on his apparent victory – he loves this country, and I wish him every success,” Collins said in a statement. “Presidential transitions are important, and the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern on January 20th.”

Collins added that Trump’s desire to challenge the results should be handled in accordance with existing laws. Trump has so far refused to concede to Biden.

She says, “I understand that the president and others have questions about the results in certain states. There is a process in place to challenge those results and, consistent with that process, the president should be afforded the opportunity to do so.”

___

1:55 p.m.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it would like to see a major infrastructure bill as the first order of business for a Biden-Harris administration and a new Congress in 2021.

The powerful business lobby group had teamed up with the AFL-CIO and other groups during Donald Trump’s presidency to push for significant new investments in roads, bridges and broadband but could not get legislation over the finish line. How to pay for such investment remains a huge stumbling block.

Neil Bradley, an executive vice president at the business group, says the chamber will continue to push the Trump administration and Congress to get an economic relief bill passed before the end of the year to help businesses survive during the coronavirus pandemic.

He says the economic recovery is “uneven across industries and across communities, and we have to focus on those who will be the last to recover from this pandemic induced recession.”

___

1:50 p.m.

The highest-ranking Black member of Congress is urging President Donald Trump to stop challenging the results of the 2020 general election and begin finding ways to work with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.

Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip, said Monday during a media availability that Trump appears to be “hell-bent on destroying the fabric that’s been holding” the country together by alleging unsubstantiated fraud in the vote counting.

Applauding the Biden transition team’s work in setting up a coronavirus task force, Clyburn said he has “absolutely no interest” in a post of his own in the administration. But he did suggest that Jaime Harrison, who recently lost to Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, might be a good pick.

Harrison told The Associated Press on Monday that he would be willing to serve. He says, “If the president-elect asks you to serve, then you serve.” He says he would leave it up to the Biden team to determine what post would be a good fit.

___

1:45 p.m.

Political appointees who are looking for job opportunities after President Donald Trump’s election defeat to President-elect Joe Biden should think twice.

A senior administration official says presidential personnel director John McEntee, the president’s former personal aide, has sent word to departments that they should terminate any political appointees seeking new work while Trump has refused to accept the electoral results.

Another official said the warning was not likely to result in any firings but rather meant to reinforce to staff that they should not act counter to Trump while he refuses to concede.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Trump’s term ends at noon on Jan. 20. Several thousand political appointees across the government will see their jobs end by that date.

Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election on Saturday.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is congratulating President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris while reaffirming the U.S.-U.N. partnership as “an essential pillar of the international cooperation needed to address the dramatic challenges facing the world today.”

The message, delivered Monday by U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, also congratulated the American people “for a vibrant exercise of democracy in their country’s elections last week.”

Dujarric said in response to a question on Harris’ historic victory as the first woman to be elected vice president that the secretary-general is always pleased and welcomes a woman getting “to break a new ceiling.”

General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir tweeted his warmest congratulations to Biden, citing his “long history” of supporting the United Nations, and to Harris for her historic election, which he called “a milestone for gender equality.”

President Donald Trump has fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, a stunning move on the heels of Trump’s failed reelection bid.

Presidents who win reelection often replace Cabinet members, including the secretary of defense, but losing presidents have kept their Pentagon chiefs in place until Inauguration Day to preserve stability in the name of national security.

Trump announced the news in a tweet, saying that “effective immediately” Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, will serve as acting secretary, sidestepping the department’s No.2-ranking official, Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist.

“Chris will do a GREAT job!” Trump tweeted. “Mark Esper has been terminated. I would like to thank him for his service.”

12:50 p.m.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has tested positive for the coronavirus. Carson is the first member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet known to have tested positive.

The department’s deputy chief of staff, Coalter Baker, said Monday that Carson is “in good spirits and feels fortunate to have access to effective therapeutics which aid and markedly speed his recovery.”

The 69-year-old Carson is among several top Trump administration officials who attended last week’s election night party at the White House. Carson has been a steadfast surrogate for the Republican president, traveling to many of the swing states before Election Day to discuss the administration’s priorities and achievements. Carson attended several events Trump held to appeal to African American voters.

Before joining the Trump administration, Carson had sought the GOP’s presidential nomination in 2016. He served for nearly 30 years as director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.

President-elect Joe Biden is imploring Americans to “wear a mask” to help fight the spread of the coronavirus — “no matter who you voted for.”

He says, “We are Americans, and our country is under threat.”

The Democrat said Monday wearing masks could slow the death toll in the COVID-19 pandemic, which he noted could climb by 200,000 before a vaccine is widely available.

Biden said, “Please, I implore you, wear a mask.” He noted masks could save the lives of older people, children and teachers and added: “It could even save your own life.”

Biden notes that he doesn’t take office until Jan. 20 but is assuming a public leadership role in the fight against the pandemic ahead of being sworn in.

___

12:05 p.m.

President-elect Joe Biden is warning the United States is “still facing a very dark winter” as he unveils plans for addressing COVID-19 pandemic.

Even as hopes of a vaccine lifted stocks, Biden said Monday another 200,000 lives could be lost before it is widely available. Biden implores Americans to “wear a mask.”

Biden says he would be guided by science in laying out the framework of a pandemic response, starting with members of a task force to prepare for his administration’s transition to overseeing it.

One week after Election Day, Vice President Mike Pence appears ready to take some time off.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Pence is scheduled to travel to Sanibel, Florida, Tuesday through Saturday. Pence has vacationed on the island along Florida’s Gulf Coast several times previously. Pence’s office didn’t immediately comment on the trip on Monday.

The trip comes as President Donald Trump has pledged to continue trying to contest the outcome of the election and as President-elect Joe Biden is ramping up his transition efforts.

Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are being briefed virtually on the coronavirus pandemic by a task force of experts their transition team announced Monday.

___

11:10 a.m.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are being briefed virtually on the coronavirus pandemic by a task force of experts their transition team announced only hours earlier.

The Democratic president-elect and vice president-elect sat at separate, individual socially distanced tables and took notes as the members introduced themselves on Monday.

Biden is also planning to give a speech on his planned response to the pandemic. Then Biden and Harris will hold hours of internal meetings about transitioning to the White House in January.

The task force briefing was at the Queen, a theater in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden’s campaign built a studio and other communications infrastructure and has spent months organizing virtual meetings and speeches.

The first to speak during the briefing was former Food Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. David Kessler. He is co-chairing the task force with former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University associate professor and associate dean whose research focuses on promoting health care equality for marginalized populations.

Also part of the group is Rick Bright, a whistleblower who was demoted after criticizing the Trump administration’s pandemic response. Bright had been head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

Journalists could watch only about two minutes of the proceedings and heard only the participants introducing themselves.

President-elect Joe Biden has announced the members of his coronavirus task force, which will put together a blueprint for fighting the pandemic.

The co-chairs are former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, former Food Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. David Kessler and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University professor and researcher.

Notable among the task force members is Rick Bright, a vaccine expert and former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was reassigned to a lesser job because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug pushed by President Donald Trump as a COVID-19 treatment.

Other members include Luciana Borio, a biodefense specialist; Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and bioethics chair at the National Institutes of Health; Dr. Atul Gawande, a Clinton administration health advisor and surgery expert; Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease expert who has studied HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; Dr. Julie Morita, a pediatric and immunization specialist; Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert and epidemiologist; Loyce Pace, a global health specialist; Dr. Robert Rodriguez, an emergency medicine expert who has researched mental health of COVID-19 responders; and Dr. Eric Goosby, an infectious disease expert who has worked in AIDS/HIV."

Ex-Vatican envoy faces sexual abuse charge in French courtThe Associated PressPARIS

PARIS (AP) — The Vatican’s former ambassador to France goes on trial Tuesday for alleged sexual misconduct.

Multiple men have accused Archbishop Luigi Ventura of groping and inappropriate touching. Exceptionally, the Vatican last year lifted the ambassador’s diplomatic immunity, allowing for his trial and for the allegations to be properly investigated.

Ventura has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

Among his accusers is Mathieu De La Souchere. He filed a police report in Paris in 2019 accusing Ventura of touching his buttocks repeatedly during a reception at Paris City Hall.

The Vatican recalled Ventura last year and he later retired. The Vatican has previously recalled its diplomats when they get into trouble during overseas postings, as is common for governments with diplomats serving abroad.

In the most high-profile case, the Vatican recalled its ambassador to the Dominican Republic and prepared to put him on trial in the city state’s criminal tribunal for allegedly sexually abusing young boys. But he died before the trial started.

Ventura’s trial comes the same day that the Vatican is releasing a much-awaited report into Theodore McCarrick, a once-influential American cardinal who was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of rumors that he was a sexual predator."

From season-altering to bizarre, injuries hit NFL yet againBy SCHUYLER DIXONAP Pro Football WriterThe Associated PressARLINGTON, Texas

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — From the season-altering to the bizarre, injuries are playing their traditionally significant role in the NFL.

Dak Prescott’s Dallas Cowboys are on the verge of a lost year when they hoped to contend after a broken ankle ended the quarterback’s season. One of their NFC East rivals, the New York Giants, barely saw their offense fully stocked, with running back Saquon Barkley tearing an ACL in Week 2.

Tyrod Taylor lost his starting job with the Los Angeles Chargers after a team doctor accidentally punctured a lung while giving the quarterback an injection. Rookie QB Justin Herbert has exceeded expectations since replacing Taylor and kept the job.

Las Vegas Raiders right tackle Trent Brown ended up in a hospital, reportedly because an IV pushed air into his bloodstream.

Brown also recently went back on the COVID-19 list, a newcomer among potential ailments with the NFL playing during a pandemic. Some players opted out before the season started because of the coronavirus.

Star pass rusher Von Miller was poised for a big year in Denver before injuring his left ankle days before the opener and eventually needing surgery. The outside linebacker is hoping to beat the odds and return in December.

Few teams have had the volume of injuries that have hit defending NFC champion San Francisco. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and running back Raheem Mostert have sprained ankles, and tight end George Kittle broke a foot.

Defensive end Nick Bosa (knee) and cornerback Richard Sherman (calf) are on injured reserve as the 49ers try to keep pace in the difficult NFC West with only eight players who have started every game.

San Francisco is the only team in the division with a losing record, at times playing without its top three cornerbacks, both starting safeties, three of the four best defensive ends, the top two receivers, three of the top four running backs and the top two tight ends, not to mention Garoppolo.

No team has a winning record in the NFC East, which is why the Cowboys and Giants aren’t completely out of the race while tied for last at 2-7.

In addition to Prescott’s gruesome ankle injury in a Week 5 win over the Giants, the Cowboys lost tight end Blake Jarwin (knee) and both starting tackles — Tyron Smith (neck) and La’el Collins (hip) — to season-ending injuries. The offensive line has been in flux all season because of a variety of injuries.

“I’ve just never been around one of these situations where every week is different than the week before,” first-year Dallas coach Mike McCarthy said. “Whether it’s your lineup on the offensive line, who your quarterback is. We’ve played, what, four quarterbacks in the last five weeks? It’s just a different year.”

Philadelphia (3-4-1) leads the NFC East despite nine of the 11 starters missing at least two games apiece with injuries. The exceptions are quarterback Carson Wentz and center Jason Kelce.

The safety of playing surfaces has been a topic for players, with union president JC Tretter, Cleveland’s center, calling for all stadiums to install grass fields. Of the 30 stadiums, 13 have synthetic surfaces.

Two of the game’s best receivers are out for the season with torn knee ligaments in Denver’s Courtland Sutton, who was injured making a tackle on an interception in Week 2, and Cleveland’s Odell Beckham Jr. New England’s Julian Edelman had knee surgery, and his season is in doubt.

Carolina All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey returned this past weekend against Kansas City after missing six games with a high ankle sprain and had 28 touches for 151 yards — 18 carries for 69 yards and 10 catches for 82 yards.

“He can’t come back soon enough,” first-year coach Matt Rhule said before the 33-31 loss to the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs. The Panthers are also without four defensive starters.

New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold missed his third game of the season Monday night with a sprained right shoulder in a 30-27 loss to New England that dropped the NFL’s only winless team to 0-9.

Jets receivers have taken turns on the sidelines, from Jamison Crowder (hamstring and groin) to Breshad Perriman (ankle and concussion), Chris Hogan (ankle) and rookie Denzel Mims, a second-round draft pick who didn’t make his debut until Week 7 because of injuries to both hamstrings in training camp.

That might help explain why New York is last in the league in points, total yards and passing yards.

New Orleans’ star receiver, Michael Thomas, has had a tumultuous season in part because of ankle and hamstring injuries. The 2019 Offensive Player of the Year was also suspended for a game, so he sat for seven weeks after the opener.

Quarterback Drew Brees saw upside in the NFC South-leading Saints learning to cope without Thomas. They lost the first two without him before winning four straight.

In Thomas’ return Sunday, New Orleans extended its winning streak to five games with a 38-3 rout of Tom Brady and Tampa Bay. Thomas had five catches for 51 yards, and was one of 12 players to catch at least one pass.

“You always hope that you wouldn’t be without him, but obviously I think that that time comes for everybody where you’ve got to find ways to win without a certain guy or maybe a few guys,” Brees said.

Arizona lost All-Pro linebacker Chandler Jones to a season-ending biceps injury five games into the season, just as Tennessee did with left tackle Taylor Lewan, who tore his ACL in an overtime win against Houston.

“We’re going to miss Taylor all the way around,” quarterback Ryan Tannehill said. “He always has something funny to say, whether it’s in a walkthrough or practice. His antics in the huddle, in games, definitely just going to miss him.”

It’s a familiar refrain every season in the NFL.

New this week: ‘I Am Greta,’ Chris Stapleton & CMA AwardsBy The Associated PressThe Associated Press

Here’s a collection curated by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists of what’s arriving on TV, streaming services and music platforms this week.

MOVIES

— When Greta Thunberg began protesting outside Swedish Parliament two years ago, it only took days for director Nathan Grossman to start trailing her in her mission to prod government leaders on the climate crisis. “I Am Greta,” which premieres Friday on Hulu, documents the enormous movement fueled by Thunberg’s one-person school strike, and a few very surreal years for the Swedish teenager. Along the way, she meets world leaders, speaks at the United Nations and reckons with her newfound notoriety.

— Is there a more simply compelling equation for a documentary than Werner Herzog + meteorites? In “Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds,” Herzog and Clive Oppenheimer ponder the mythic, spiritual gravitational pull of meteors and comets on humanity — and on Herzog, himself. Having already surveyed volcanoes with his co-director in “Into the Inferno,” Herzog here turns his gaze to the cosmos to rhapsodize on the hunks of rocks hurtling through space. On Apple TV+ Friday.

— Three decades ago, Martin Scorsese founded the Film Foundation. Since then, it has been a critical bulwark of film preservation, saving an enormous number of movies from deterioration and illuminating the brilliance of countless others. Over 30 years, the nonprofit organization has aided in some 850 restorations. To celebrate the Film Foundation, the Criterion Channel on Sunday will begin a 30-film series, set to expand over the next year, featuring some of the titles given new life by Scorsese’s creation. Among them: “The Red Shoes,” “It Happened One Night,” “Ugetsu,” “Once Upon a Time in the West” and “Primary.”

MUSIC

— 2020 has been a rough year, and Andrea Bocelli has an album to help you feel better about life. The all-star Italian tenor will release “Believe” on Friday, and it is packed with songs set to soothe the soul. The iconic Alison Krauss and Bocelli team up for a cover of “Amazing Grace” and there are also two duets with opera singer Cecilia Bartoli. The 14-track album even includes a previously unreleased song from revered Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who died earlier this year at age 81.

— After releasing two chart-topping albums in 2017, superstar country singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton is back with a new collection of songs coming out Friday. His fourth solo album, “Starting Over,” includes 11 original songs he co-wrote as well as covers of John Fogerty’s “Joy of My Life” and Guy Clark’s “Worry B Gone” and “Old Friends.” Special guests include Stapleton’s wife, singer Morgane Stapleton, as well as producer (and acoustic guitar player) Dave Cobb, Mike Campbell (electric guitar), Benmont Tench (Hammond B3 organ), Paul Franklin (pedal steel) and the All Voices Choir.

— You can always count on Grammy-winning a cappella group Pentatonix to release Christmas music. The fivesome – whose first five holiday albums have sold 12.5 million units worldwide – will release their sixth holiday album, “We Need a Little Christmas,” on Friday. Alongside Ben Bram, Pentatonix produced “Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone),” the first single from the new album.

636,,http://www.breitbart.com/news/scottish-premiership-season-under-threat-due-to-quarantine-breach/,Celtic and Aberdeen games off after quarantine breach: Sturgeon,"Glasgow (AFP) – The Scottish Premiership matches of champions Celtic and Aberdeen will be postponed due to breaches of Scotland’s strict coronavirus quarantine rules in a “yellow card” to the sport, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday.

Sturgeon warned that clubs would put the new season in jeopardy if they failed to respect the rules.

Celtic’s game with St Mirren on Wednesday will not go ahead after Belgian defender Boli Bolingoli admitted he had failed to observe quarantine protocols after a trip to Spain. Anyone returning to Scotland from Spain must spend two weeks in quarantine.

Bolingoli, 25, played in the 1-1 draw with Kilmarnock on Sunday, the team’s second match of the season.

The Scottish government is already furious at eight Aberdeen players who visited a bar last week. Two of them subsequently tested positive, forcing the postponement of last Saturday’s game with St Johnstone.

Aberdeen’s home game with Hamilton on Wednesday is now off as well and Saturday’s match between Celtic and Aberdeen has also been postponed.

‘Yellow card’

Sturgeon said Bolingoli’s case was a “flagrant breach of the rules.”

“As a minimum, you should not be expecting to see Aberdeen and Celtic play over the course of the coming week and we’ll see what the other conclusions are,” said Sturgeon.

Sturgeon — whose administration by coincidence held talks with Premiership managers and captains on Monday — issued a thinly-veiled threat.

“Consider today the yellow card. Next time it will be the red card because you will leave us with absolutely no choice.”

Although Bolingoli apologised for his behaviour, Celtic did not hide their fury in a statement released later on Tuesday, saying: “It is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible action in current circumstances.”

Bolingoli apologised to his manager, teammates, supporters “and so many others for letting them down so badly”.

“I am guilty of a major error of judgement,” the 25-year-old added.

“I know what I did was wrong and I know that I must now deal with the consequences.”

Celtic said Bolingoli would feel the full force of their disciplinary procedures.

“Celtic unreservedly condemns and apologises for the behaviour of the player Boli Bolingoli in travelling to Spain without informing the club and in failing to observe quarantine restrictions,” the club said.

“It is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible action in current circumstances and we find it beyond explanation.

“The club will take immediate action through our own disciplinary procedures.

“Celtic are in touch with every SPFL club today, and with all relevant authorities, to apologise for the fact that one of our employees has created so much additional difficulty through his actions.”

Celtic manager Neil Lennon said he was “absolutely livid” at what he called “a total betrayal of trust.”

Steven Gerrard, manager of Celtic’s bitter rivals Rangers, said the message coming out of the talks with the administration had been crystal clear about clubs’ responsibilities.

He said the “severity” of the warnings had shown “how important it is that everyone behaves in the right way”.

“And it is a concern and a worry because if mistakes continue to happen, there is no doubt about it, the football season will be cancelled and that’s not what I want or what anyone wants at Rangers, or throughout Scottish football.”"

Alex Trebek, long-running ‘Jeopardy!’ host, dies at 80 By LYNN ELBERAP Television WriterThe Associated PressLOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Alex Trebek, who presided over the beloved quiz show “Jeopardy!” for more than 30 years with dapper charm and a touch of schoolmaster strictness, died Sunday. He was 80.

Trebek, who announced in 2019 that he had advanced pancreatic cancer, died at his Los Angeles home, surrounded by family and friends, “Jeopardy!” studio Sony said.

The Canadian-born host, who made a point of informing fans about his health directly, spoke in a calm, even tone as he revealed his illness and hope for a cure in a video posted March 6, 2019.

In the video, Trebek said he was joining the 50,000 other Americans who receive such a diagnosis each year and that he recognized that the prognosis was not encouraging.

But Trebek said he intended to fight it and keep working, even joking that he needed to beat the disease because his “Jeopardy!” contract ran for three more years. Less than a week later, he opened the show with a message acknowledging the outpouring of kind words and prayers he’d received.

“Thanks to the — believe it or not — hundreds of thousands of people who have sent in tweets, texts, emails, cards and letters wishing me well,” Trebek said. “I’m a lucky guy.”

The program tapes weeks of shows in advance, and the remaining episodes with Trebek will air through Dec. 25, a Sony spokeswoman said.

Messages of grief and respect from former contestants, celebrities and the wider public quickly followed news of his loss.

“Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did. He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I’m grateful for every minute I got to spend with him,” tweeted “Jeopardy!” champion Ken Jennings. “Thinking today about his family and his Jeopardy! family — which, in a way, included millions of us.”

“It was one of the great privileges of my life to spend time with this courageous man while he fought the battle of his life. You will never be replaced in our hearts, Alex,” James Holzhauer, another “Jeopardy!” star, posted on Twitter.

John Legend tweeted that he was “obsessed with Jeopardy as a nerdy kid growing up in Ohio. I’ve loved and revered Alex Trebek since I can remember. What an iconic career.”

“Jeopardy!” bills itself as “America’s favorite quiz show” and captivated the public with a unique format in which contestants were told the answers and had to provide the questions on a variety of subjects, including movies, politics, history and popular culture.

They would answer by saying “What is … ?” or “Who is …. ?”

Trebek, who became its host in 1984, was a master of the format, engaging in friendly banter with contestants, appearing genuinely pleased when they answered correctly and, at the same time, moving the game along in a brisk no-nonsense fashion whenever people struggled for answers.

He never pretended to know the answers himself if he really didn’t, deferring to the show’s experts to decide whether a somewhat vague answer had come close enough to be counted as correct.

“I try not to take myself too seriously,” he told an interviewer in 2004. “I don’t want to come off as a pompous ass and indicate that I know everything when I don’t.”

The show was the brainstorm of Julann Griffin, wife of the late talk show host-entrepreneur Merv Griffin, who said she suggested to him one day that he create a game show where people were given the answers.

“Jeopardy!” debuted on NBC in 1964 with Art Fleming as emcee and was an immediate hit. It lasted until 1975, then was revived in syndication with Trebek.

Long identified by a full head of hair and trim mustache (though in 2001 he startled viewers by shaving his mustache, “completely on a whim”), Trebek was more than qualified for the job, having started his game show career on “Reach for the Top” in his native country.

Moving to the U.S. in 1973, he appeared on “The Wizard of Odds,” “High Rollers,” “The $128,000 Question” and “Double Dare.” Even during his run on “Jeopardy!”, Trebek worked on other shows. In the early 1990s, he was the host of three — “Jeopardy!”, “To Tell the Truth” and “Classic Concentration.”

“Jeopardy!” made him famous. He won five Emmys as its host, including one last June, and received stars on both the Hollywood and Canadian walks of fame. In 2012, the show won a prestigious Peabody Award.

He taped his daily “Jeopardy!” shows at a frenetic pace, recording as many as 10 episodes (two weeks’ worth) in just two days. After what was described as a mild heart attack in 2007, he was back at work in just a month.

He posted a video in January 2018 announcing he’d undergone surgery for blood clots on the brain that followed a fall he’d taken. The show was on hiatus during his recovery.

It had yet to bring in a substitute host for Trebek — save once, when he and “Wheel of Fortune” host Pat Sajak swapped their TV jobs as an April’s Fool prank.

In 2012, Trebek acknowledged that he was considering retirement, but had been urged by friends to stay on so he could reach 30 years on the show. He still loved the job, he declared: “What’s not to love? You have the security of a familiar environment, a familiar format, but you have the excitement of new clues and new contestants on every program. You can’t beat that!”

Although many viewers considered him one of the key reasons for the show’s success, Trebek himself insisted he was only there to keep things moving.

“I’m introduced as the host of ‘Jeopardy!’, not the star,” he said in a 2012 interview. “My job is to provide the atmosphere and assistance to the contestants to get them to perform at their very best,” he explained. “And if I’m successful doing that, I will be perceived as a nice guy and the audience will think of me as being a bit of a star.”

“But not if I try to steal the limelight! The stars of `Jeopardy!′ are the material and the contestants,” he said.

In a January 2019 interview with The Associated Press, Trebek discussed his decision to keep going with “Jeopardy!”

“It’s not as if I’m overworked — we tape 46 days a year,” he said. But he acknowledged he would retire someday, if he lost his edge or the job was no longer fun, adding: “And it’s still fun.”

Born July 22, 1940, in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, Trebek was sent off to boarding school by his Ukrainian father and French-Canadian mother when he was barely in his teens.

After graduating high school, he spent a summer in Cincinnati to be close to a girlfriend, then returned to Canada to attend college. After earning a philosophy degree from the University of Ottawa, he went to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Co., starting as a staff announcer and eventually becoming a radio and TV reporter.

He became a U.S. citizen in 1997. Trebek’s first marriage, to Elaine Callei, ended in divorce. In 1990, he married Jean Currivan, and they had two children, Emily and Matthew. Trebek lived with his family in Los Angeles’ Studio City section, not far from Hollywood.

Trebek is survived by his wife, their two children and his stepdaughter, Nicky.

638,,http://www.breitbart.com/news/peru-congress-votes-to-impeach-president-citing-corruption/,"Peru Congress votes to impeach president, citing corruption","Nov. 10 (UPI) — Peruvian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to impeach President Martin Vizcarra as the South American nation continues to reel from the coronavirus pandemic.

Congress voted 105-19 on Monday in favor of the opposition motion to remove Vizcarra, 57, a decision the president said he didn’t agree with but wouldn’t contest.

“I declare that without agreeing with the decision, today I will leave the presidential palace and go to my home,” he said in a national address. “History and the Peruvian people will judge the decisions that each one of us makes.”

In a statement on Twitter addressed to the Peruvian people, he said they were his “support and strength” during his nearly three-year presidency.

“I leave with a clear conscience, my head held high and my duty accomplished,” he wrote. “Until another chance.”

Opposition lawmaker and the head of the Congress Manuel Merino is expected to be sworn in as interim president, as stipulated by Peru’s Constitution, for the remainder of Vizcarra’s term, which ends in July.

The impeachment resolution alleged corruption against Vizcarra, who vowed to fight that very crime when he was sworn in as president in 2018 following the resignation of his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.

Kuczynski stepped down a day before an impeachment vote following accusations of corruption.

Vizcarra has denied the accusations of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from companies that won contracts when he was the governor of Moquegua in southern Peru.

Jo-Marie Burt, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and human rights advocacy organization, said on Twitter that the charges against Vizcarra “seem to have some basis to them” but that observers are unsure they would warrant his impeachment.

“Vizcarra himself had promised to submit to an investigation at the end of his term,” she said.

It is the second time in months the opposition-dominated Congress held an impeachment vote to oust Vizcarra. In September, the effort alleging he misused public funds only gained the support of 32 lawmakers. Vizcarra denied those accusations as well.

Following Monday’s impeachment vote, protesters against the ousting of Vizcarra gathered near the Congress building, Bloomberg reported.

The impeachment came as Peru continues to battle one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world that has caused the country’s economy to contract 30.2% in the second quarter following a shrinkage of 3.5% in the first.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have ranked Peru the 12th sickest country to the pandemic, suffering more than 922,000 infections including nearly 35,000 deaths to COVID-19."

Rogers: ‘One of the Silver Linings in this Nightmare We’re Going Through Is to Know Nancy Pelosi Could Be Thrown Overboard’,"One of the stories overshadowed by the presidential election outcome from last week was the losses suffered by Democrats in the House of Representatives and what it could mean for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) future. During an interview with Mobile, AL radio’s FM Talk 106.5 on Monday, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, called the possibility of Pelosi losing her leadership post a “silver lining,” which comes out of the apparent friction with House Democratic caucus.

“That is one of the silver-linings in this nightmare we’re going through, is to know Nancy Pelosi could be thrown overboard by the people she has been promoting,” Rogers said. “I’m not in that conference. I don’t know how it is going to work out. I’ve learned never to underestimate her. But having said that — I saw what happened to John Boehner with numbers that were not as bad as what she’s got, and they are livid right now. You’ve got the non-socialist wing of the Democrat Party, which is not that big, that is just furious that all the liberal agenda items they’ve pushed — like Medicare for all, like the Green New Deal, like socialist legislation — specifically, the election bill you just talked about — almost got them beat in their individual districts.”

Rogers noted pressures from the left-wing of the House Democratic caucus as well, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Rogers predicted if Pelosi were to lose her post, it could mean the end of leadership posts for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) as well.

“They kept the majority but barely kept the majority, and because of that hard-left turn they took,” Rogers explained. “Then you’ve got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her bunch, which by the way, she added to her numbers in their conference who are livid that these other people are turning their back on what they see as where the Democrat conference should be going. In order for Nancy Pelosi to get her chairmanship in the last Congress, the current Congress the last time around, she had to pledge that she would not serve more than two terms as Speaker and that she would support this socialist agenda that this left-wing had.”

“Well, she did those two things,” he continued. “She almost lost the majority over it. Now she has got the rest of the conference mad at her. The left-wing is now because of the circumstance, and I think they’re going to be looking for a change in leadership, and I don’t think it is going to end with Nancy. If they throw her overboard — I think they’ll throw Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn overboard, too because they kind of work as a team. I don’t know who will replace them, but you can bet it will be more left-wing than those folks.”

Do masks with antiviral coating offer more protection?By The Associated PressThe Associated Press

Do masks with antiviral coating offer more protection?

It’s an intriguing idea, but there haven’t been enough rigorous independent studies to establish whether antiviral masks are better at protecting wearers or preventing the spread of the virus.

Their specifics vary, but many antiviral masks are supposed to be made or coated with materials that have extra virus-fighting properties, such as copper.

Websites for several antiviral masks do not provide detailed information about how researchers tested their safety or effectiveness, said Hyo-Jick Choi, a materials science expert at the University of Alberta.

But it usually takes years to design and test new mask technology, said Choi, who is part of a group that has been developing a different type of antiviral mask since before the pandemic.

Masks marketed as being “antiviral” often cost more than N-95 and surgical masks. A single coated mask can cost up to $10; disposable surgical masks and N-95 masks sell at large retailers for between 35 cents and $3 per mask.

Choi said a simpler way to boost the effectiveness of the masks you’re already using is to ensure you’re putting them on, wearing them and taking them off correctly.

And no mask can fully protect wearers, “but almost any mask can help to protect others around the wearers,” said Jiaxing Huang, a professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern University.

Indigenous candidates’ wins in Congress give hope for changeBy FELICIA FONSECAAssociated PressThe Associated PressFLAGSTAFF, Ariz.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Internet access, health care and basic necessities like running water and electricity within Indigenous communities have long been at the center of congressional debates. But until recently, Congress didn’t have many Indigenous members who were pushing for solutions and funding for those issues.

Hope is growing after the Native delegation in the U.S. House expanded by two on Election Day: Yvette Herrell, who is Cherokee and prevailed in New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, and Kai Kahele, a Native Hawaiian who won that state’s 2nd District.

They will join four Native Americans who won reelection: Reps. Deb Haaland of New Mexico, who’s Laguna; Sharice Davids of Kansas, who’s Ho-Chunk; Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who’s Cherokee; and Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who’s Chickasaw.

Of the six who prevailed, half are Democrats and half Republican — a divide Cole said would “absolutely be indispensable in passing anything the next two years.” The winners were among a dozen Indigenous major-party candidates running in top-of-the-ticket races.

“I always consider tribal affairs to be non-partisan,” Cole said Monday. “The tribal sovereignty and trust responsibility are not partisan issues. You either believe in those or you don’t.”

Representation means progress, scholars say, particularly for Indigenous children who will see their language and culture on display in Congress. It’s fueled by efforts to recruit Indigenous candidates and back them financially, get-out-the-vote efforts and Native communities flexing their political muscle. About 100 Indigenous candidates were on general election ballots across the country, most seeking seats in state legislatures.

“It’s seeing people that look like us in Congress that is inspiring women, more than anything, to run,” said Traci Morris, executive director of the American Indian Policy Institute at Arizona State University who’s Chickasaw. “That’s what I see — I see we all think we can do it now. And there was huge involvement.”

Still, Indigenous people remain underrepresented in Congress. The U.S. Senate has not had a Native American member since Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado retired in 2005. He has Northern Cheyenne heritage. Democrat Paulette Jordan, who is Coeur d’Alene, lost to the incumbent for a U.S. Senate seat in Idaho this year.

But the House victories won’t necessarily translate to immediate power in Washington. Kahele said he imagines he’ll spend time learning about Indigenous issues outside of his native Hawaii and educating other Native and non-Natives in Congress.

And while it’s not easy to ignore Indigenous lawmakers if they’re sitting across the table, they often can be pigeonholed, said Richard Monette, who teaches federal Indian law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

“I think that, in the end, the scale tips toward being more good than bad,” said Monette, a former chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. “That’s fair to say, but I will say this is complex.”

Herrell, for example, said she’s proud of her heritage but didn’t tout it in her bid to unseat Democrat Xochitl Torres Small in a complicated district that includes minority communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, tribes, ranchers, farmers, and oil and gas industry workers.

“I really prefer to call myself an American,” she told The Associated Press. “I’m a New Mexican, and it’s not about labels, it’s not about race. It’s about people and representing all of our values, all of our shared likes and even dislikes and coming together.”

The House formed the bipartisan Congressional Native American Caucus in 1997 that has dozens of non-Indigenous members and is now led by Cole and Haaland. Most notably, it worked to pass two bills to help address the epidemic of missing and slain Native American women. But the leadership team, which also includes Davids and Mullin, doesn’t always agree.

“We all make decisions based on two things: our life experiences and the way we were raised,” Mullin said in a statement to the AP. “With more Native Americans in Congress, we can make a bigger impact and better educate our colleagues about Native issues.”

Haaland and Cole said the focus in the upcoming session will be COVID-19’s impact on Native communities, chronic shortfalls in federal funding for tribes, broadband internet access, further addressing missing and slain Indigenous women and land put into trust for tribes.

Kahele, who became the second Native Hawaiian elected to Congress since statehood, has said he will champion Indigenous voices and push for things like housing assistance, the protection of natural resources and for the federal government to right the wrongs committed against Indigenous Hawaiians.

Hawaii was an independent kingdom until 1893, when American businessmen backed by U.S. Marines overthrew Queen Liliuokalani. The U.S. annexed Hawaii five years later, making it a territory. It gained statehood in 1959.

While the U.S. apologized in 1993, Kahele said “that was the first step in what needs to be a process of healing and reparations.”

Native Hawaiians are not among the more than 570 federally recognized Native American tribes, though they’ve sought the designation. They share common struggles in land loss, health care and lack of economic prosperity and have access to some of the same federal funding and preference for bidding on federal contracts as tribes.

Kahele said he’s already reached out to his Native colleagues in the House.

“If we work together, we can achieve so much more,” Kahele said. “And there are a lot out there who want us to fight, to compete against each other for the same federal resources.”

Experts say no need to cancel Thanksgiving, but play it safeBy CARLA K. JOHNSONAP Medical WriterThe Associated Press

A safe Thanksgiving during a pandemic is possible, but health experts know their advice is as tough to swallow as dry turkey: Stay home. Don’t travel. If you must gather, do it outdoors.

With a fall surge of coronavirus infections gripping the U.S., many Americans are forgoing tradition and getting creative with celebrations.

For the first time in five years, Atlanta nutrition consultant Marisa Moore won’t travel to South Carolina to see her large extended family. Instead, she plans to video chat with them as she attempts her first home-baked apple pie. When it’s time to eat, they’ll compare plates.

“We’ll talk all day,” Moore said.

On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its holiday guidance, noting the virus crisis is worsening and that small household gatherings are “an important contributor.” The CDC said older adults and others at heightened risk of severe illness should avoid gathering with people outside their households.

Experts point to Canada, where Thanksgiving was celebrated Oct. 12. Clusters of cases tied to family gatherings followed. “This sucks. It really, really does,” Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said two weeks later.

There’s no need to cancel the holiday. Spending time with loved ones is important for health too, said Lacy Fehrenbach, Washington state deputy secretary of health.

The coronavirus spreads more easily when people are crowded together inside, so Fehrenbach encourages new outdoor traditions such as hiking as a family. Guest lists for indoor feasts should be small enough so people can sit six feet apart while unmasked and eating, she said. Open the windows to keep air circulating.

The more people who attend a gathering, the greater the chances that someone in the party will be carrying the virus, Fehrenbach said, “even someone that you know and love.”

On any other Thanksgiving, dozens of Olga Garcia’s family members would squeeze into her home to make tamales, watch football and tell stories. This year, the 61-year-old professional caregiver will deliver food to family spread along 30 miles of the North Cascades Highway in Washington state.

If the plan works, everyone will sit down at the same time to eat in their own homes and join a group phone call.

“We’re going to be wise about this,” Garcia said. “We’re just crossing our fingers that in 2021 we’ll be able to sit down at our table and get crazy again.”

What about a quarantine? The magic day to start a pre-Thanksgiving quarantine is Nov. 13, according to Lindsey Leininger, who leads the Nerdy Girls, a cadre of scientists collaborating on a website called Dear Pandemic.

A strict quarantine would mean no grocery shopping, no working outside the home and no in-person school for 14 days.

What about testing? The best day to test would be as close to Turkey Day as possible while still leaving enough time to get results. But a test might not catch a still brewing infection so the best plan is the quarantine for two weeks — the time it can take for symptoms to show up.

Instead of that rigmarole, Leininger said her children will see their grandparents via Zoom on Thanksgiving. After dinner, the family will meet neighbors in the driveway for pie.

“We bring our own pie and they bring their own pie,” said Leininger of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. “It’s cold here in northern New England, but pie can be a quick activity.”

When it seems cruel that everything most loved about Thanksgiving is forbidden, finding humor in absurdity can help. In a video on Twitter, New York comedian Matt Buechele offers an increasingly silly list of Thanksgiving precautions, including water balloons filled with gravy and kids’ tables for all.

“Before we eat, everyone’s going to go around the table, say one thing they’re thankful for and one thing they scream into their pillow at night,” Buechele said.

That’s a joke, but the comedian thinks it could be a cathartic practice. “The thing I continue to scream into my pillow is, ‘Why is it like this? It didn’t have to be this way! And, my God, when will it end?’” he said.

In New Jersey, the nonprofit HealthBarn Foundation usually co-hosts a sit-down Thanksgiving feast for 150 older adults. This year, volunteers prepared and froze individual meals and packaged them in insulated bags. Seniors will be able reheat the food at home.

“No one wanted to cancel it,” said HealthBarn director Stacey Antine. “You want to show that you still love people and honor them. And you want to make sure that they have nutritious food for this important holiday dinner.”

In Washington state, Garcia will get up before dawn to roast a 20-pound turkey and bake capirotada, a bread pudding layered with cheese, bananas, raisins, cinnamon and pecans. Her siblings will prepare other specialties in their homes: tamales, enchiladas, pico de gallo, ceviche, green bean casserole, yams with marshmallows, pumpkin pie and pecan pie. Up and down the route, the feast will be divided into boxes and delivered.

“It’s a sad time,” Garcia said. “But it can also be a grateful time: that we’re all here, that we have a roof over our head, a job to go to and enough food to go around. And for those that don’t have enough, we can say, ‘Here’s a plate.’”

In court moves, Britney Spears seeks freedom from fatherBy ANDREW DALTONAP Entertainment WriterThe Associated PressLOS ANGELES

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Britney Spears wants to be freed from her father.

The pop star’s moves have been missing from stage and screen in a career hiatus that shows no signs of ending, but she’s been making all kinds of maneuvers in court in an attempt to gain greater control over her life and money after 12 years of a court conservatorship run mainly by her dad, James Spears.

Tuesday afternoon, a Los Angeles judge will hear arguments on Spears’ requests, the boldest of which would remove James Spears as co-conservator for what his daughter says is an unwillingness to share control of her more than $60 million in assets.

The conservatorship, known in many states as a guardianship, began in 2008 when she was having serious mental struggles and an often public meltdown. The arrangements are normally limited to people with severely diminished ability to make decisions for themselves, and are meant to be temporary, but Britney Spears has remained under court control longer than anyone expected.

She has acknowledged that the arrangement was necessary when it began, and probably saved her career, and she remained silent both in public and in court for nearly all of its existence.

But starting in August she began publicly seeking to choose who oversaw her life and money, asking for greater transparency in the court’s often secret moves, and even declaring that she was sympathetic to fans who have increasingly demanded in protests and online posts that those in control must #FreeBritney.

James Spears and a co-conservator, attorney Andrew Wallet, ran the conservatorship for 11 years. Last year, Wallet stepped down, leaving James Spears entirely in charge. He soon temporarily stepped down as conservator of Spears’ person, citing health reasons, but kept his role as conservator of her finances.

In August of this year, Britney Spears said she strongly objected to her father returning as conservator of her person, and wanted to make her approved replacement, Jodi Montgomery, permanent in the role.

In September she went even further, asking that a corporate fiduciary, the Bessemer Trust, become conservator of her finances instead of her father.

James Spears first filed to have Wallet return as his co-conservator instead, but Wallet withdrew after Britney Spears objected.

James Spears subsequently said he would work with the Bessemer Trust, but now Britney Spears is insisting that such an arrangement would be “doomed to failure” and her father needs to be out entirely.

In documents filed by her court-appointed attorney for the conservatorship, Samuel Ingham III, Spears said her father was clearly planning to attempt “to retain full functional control of her assets, books and records in the face of Britney’s objections.”

She also cited his recent failure to notify her that her business manager had resigned and he had appointed a new one, and said she plans to object to the accounting reports that will be made at Tuesday’s hearing.

In his own filings, James Spears argued that he has done his job well, taking the estate from being in debt and facing tens of millions in lawsuits to its current value of over $60 million.

“Mr. Spears is doing exactly what he is supposed to be doing as conservator of the estate; he should be commended, not suspended,” one court filing said.

James Spears did all this, the filing argued, while working hard to restore his daughter “to good health, reunite her with her children, and revive her career.”

“Throughout his service as Conservator, Mr. Spear’s sole motivation has been his unconditional love for his daughter and a fierce desire to protect her from those trying to take advantage of her,” the filing said.

It is not clear whether Judge Brenda Penny will make any decisions Tuesday. She may seek time to reach decisions or ask that arguments continue on another date.

Spears is expected to take part in the hearing by phone, as most or all of the participants will as allowed under the court’s pandemic guidelines.

The proceedings are likely to be closed to the public and media, as Penny has routinely done at the request of James Spears and his attorneys, who have argued for his daughter’s need for privacy.

But in her recent spate of filings, Spears has said she has gotten more privacy than is good for her, arguing that the secrecy has not been helpful, and welcomed the scrutiny of the #FreeBritney movement, which her father has scorned.

In court documents, Britney Spears said, “Far from being a conspiracy theory or a ‘joke’ as James reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James’ aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.”

It’s done: The NBA comes back on Dec. 22, a 72-game seasonBy TIM REYNOLDSAP Basketball WriterThe Associated Press

It’s official: The NBA is coming back Dec. 22.

The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced Monday night that they’ve struck a deal on rules for this coming season, setting the stage for what will be a frenzied few weeks before games resume.

Teams will play a 72-game schedule, which will be revealed in the coming weeks. The league said a new system will be used to ensure that the split of basketball-related income continues, one of the many details that had to be collectively bargained with the union because the current agreement between the sides had a great deal of language that needed reworking because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Negotiations with free agents will be allowed to begin at 6 p.m. on Nov. 20, with signings permitted starting at 12:01 p.m. on Nov. 22 — an extraordinarily fast window for the NBA, which typically has about a week spanning the start of talks and the beginning of signings. But with training camps this year beginning Dec. 1, both sides evidently feel there isn’t a need to draw out the process any longer than necessary.

Many rosters could be considerably reshaped by then, with trades likely to be permissible again in the coming days — the exact details there still being worked out — and the NBA draft set to take place Nov. 18. Player and team options likely will be settled around that same time. Free agency starts two days after the draft, with around 100 players set for unrestricted status.

The salary cap and tax level will remain unchanged. The cap was $109.14 million this past season, with the tax level at $132,627,000. The real numbers will be affected by the shortened schedule — last year’s numbers were based on the standard 82-game season, a threshold that won’t be reached this year.

The salary cap for 2021-22 is guaranteed to rise somewhere between 3% and 10%, the league said, which means it’ll be somewhere between $112.4 million and $120.1 million.

The league’s board of governors will vote to finalize the deal, which is a formality. NBA general managers also have a meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss matters.

Meyers Leonard, a free-agent-to-be who spent this past season with the Miami Heat and served as the team’s player rep to the NBPA, said he had some concerns about getting all the logistical matters completed in time for a Dec. 22 opening night. He resumed his offseason workouts Monday after he and his wife took a 4,000-mile tour-bus trip arranged by Coors Light from Miami to Los Angeles with many stops along the way.

“Without knowing all the ins and outs, Dec. 22nd, from a money standpoint, you play more games, you play your Christmas games, it probably makes sense,” Leonard said. “But there’s a lot of logistical things that I know cannot be easy. And the discussions that are being had are very dynamic and very difficult conversations.”

There are countless other issues to work out, such as all the health and safety protocols now that games won’t be played in the safety of a bubble and teams will be traveling to various cities once again.

Players were tested daily in the bubble, and nobody tested positive because of the very strict protocols. It’ll be much tougher to avoid a COVID-related issue with the league back to some sort of normalcy this season.

“There’s going to be people testing positive,” Leonard said. “I don’t know about left and right, but it’s going to happen. And then what happens? It’s a tough time we’re all dealing with. The disease is very strange. It’s going to be interesting to see how the league rolls with the punches, so to speak.”

For the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Eastern Conference champion Heat, it will be the shortest offseason in NBA history — with seven weeks separating the end of the NBA Finals and the planned Dec. 1 start of training camp.

But for the eight teams that didn’t make the restart bubble at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida this summer, it has been a marathon offseason, with none of those teams — Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Charlotte, Golden State, Minnesota, New York and Detroit — having played since the second week of March. The NBA shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic on March 11, then took 22 of its 30 teams to Disney to resume the season in July.

Patriots storm back to beat Jets 30-27, end 4-game skidBy DENNIS WASZAK Jr.AP Pro Football WriterThe Associated PressEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Cam Newton and the New England Patriots appeared headed to a fifth straight loss — this one against the winless New York Jets, of all teams.

Then came the fourth quarter, and potential embarrassment turned into big-time relief.

Nick Folk kicked a 51-yard field goal as time expired to win it 30-27 on Monday night after Newton rallied the Patriots from a 10-point deficit to avoid the franchise’s first five-game skid since 1995.

“It shows the character of this team,” said Rex Burkhead, who had a 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. “Just battling, fighting. It shows the strength we have. We’re not going to quit. We’re not going to lay down.”

Newton had two touchdown runs, with the second tying it at 27 with 1:57 remaining. He also brushed off his struggles of the past few weeks, including a fumble against Buffalo last week that sealed a loss.

“I’m getting tired of sucking,” said Newton, who was 27 of 35 for 274 yards passing. “It’s simple. As a competitor, you know what your standard is. Taking pride in your work, that’s what it comes down to.”

After the Jets (0-9) went three-and-out for the first time all night, the Patriots (3-5) got the ball back with 47 seconds left and went to work.

Newton had a 5-yard run on third-and-1 from the New England 42 and then spiked the ball with 8 seconds remaining. He followed with a 20-yard pass to Jakobi Meyers to put Folk — who made several big kicks for the Jets from 2010-16 — in position for the winning field goal.

“I had a lot of good memories here at MetLife (Stadium),” said Folk, who had been dealing with a back injury. “I just added one to the other sideline tonight.”

Meanwhile, the Jets dropped to 0-9 for the first time in franchise history, and this was one was particularly agonizing.

“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” said wide receiver Jamison Crowder, whose 20-yard TD catch shortly before halftime gave the Jets a 20-10 lead. “That was a tough loss right there. That was a game we should’ve won.”

After Folk’s 29-yarder with 6:04 left cut the Patriots’ deficit to 27-20, quarterback Joe Flacco — having a solid night until that point while starting for an injured Sam Darnold — tried to put the game away.

Instead, he swayed the momentum in New England’s favor.

Flacco’s deep pass down the middle for Denzel Mims was picked off by J.C. Jackson. That set up Newton’s tying TD — and deflated the Jets, who couldn’t recover.

“I don’t think I would’ve made a different decision in the moment,” Flacco said. “But, obviously, I’d like to have that one back.”

Flacco was 18 of 25 for 262 yards and three touchdown passes — two to Breshad Perriman and one to Crowder — but had the game-changing interception.

With the Patriots down by 10, Newton marched them down the field to open the second half, capping a 14-play drive with Burkhead’s 1-yard plunge into the end zone to make it 20-17.

But the Jets answered right back, with Flacco finding a wide-open Perriman in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown and a 27-17 lead with 30 seconds left in the third quarter.

A miscue by the Jets on special teams kept the Patriots’ next drive alive.

After Newton stumbled on third-and-1 and was stopped for a 4-yard loss, New England appeared to have to settle for a 32-yard field goal. But the Jets were called for 12 men on the field — resulting in a first down for the Patriots. The defense made up for the mistake, getting a red-zone stop — with an assist from a holding penalty on New England right tackle Mike Onwenu — and holding the Patriots to a field goal to make it 27-20 with 6:04 left.

But New England got the ball right back when Flacco was picked off by Jackson, who has interceptions in four straight games.

With the Jets looking for a stop on third down, Bless Austin was called for defensive holding, keeping the drive alive.

Damien Harris ran for 21 yards to get New England into Jets territory. He followed with a 9-yard gain, but it was called back because of an offensive holding penalty on Meyers. Harris also took a big hit on the run and was down for several minutes before walking gingerly to the sideline.

Three plays later, Newton completed a 19-yard pass to Meyers and then ran for 3 yards on fourth-and-1. Newton hit Damiere Byrd for 31 yards to put the ball at the 3.

With a taxed Jets defense tiring, Newton ran for 2 yards on first down, was stopped for no gain and then pushed his way into the end zone for his second rushing TD of the game to tie it with 1:57 remaining.

“It was a good win,” coach Bill Belichick said. “I thought we made the plays we needed to make at the end of the game. Certainly some things we can do better. But we played good complementary football at the end of the game.”

JOE PASSES JOE

Flacco passed Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Montana (40,551) for 20th on the NFL’s career yards passing list on his first TD pass to Perriman, a 50-yarder in the second quarter that put the Jets up 13-7. Flacco has thrown for 40,726 yards.

CATCHING ON

Meyers had 12 catches for a career-best 169 yards, joining Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman as the only Patriots players with 150 or more yards receiving in a game in the past five seasons.

INJURIES

Patriots: LT Isaiah Wynn left briefly in the first half with an ankle injury, but returned.

Jets: Rookie left tackle Mekhi Becton left in the first half with a chest injury, but coach Adam Gase was unsure if it was a torn pectoral. Cornerback Brian Poole was also ruled out at halftime after injuring a knee in the second quarter.

UP NEXT

Patriots: Host the Baltimore Ravens next Sunday night.

Jets: Bye week. New York is at the Los Angeles Chargers on Nov. 22.

Florida cities mop up after deluge from Tropical Storm EtaBy FREIDA FRISARO and KELLI KENNEDYAssociated PressThe Associated PressFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Cities in South Florida mopped up after Tropical Storm Eta flooded some urban areas with a deluge that swamped entire neighborhoods and filled some homes with rising water that did not drain for hours.

It was the 28th named storm in a busy hurricane season, and the first to make landfall in Florida. This year tied the record with 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck the Gulf Coast. But that was before Theta formed late Monday night over the northeast Atlantic, becoming the basin’s 29th named storm to eclipse the 2005 record.

After striking Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane and killing nearly 70 people from Mexico to Panama, Eta swept over South Florida, then moved Monday into the Gulf of Mexico near where the Everglades meet the sea, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph).

Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, was among the harder hit areas.

“It’s very bad. In the last 20 years, I’ve never seen anything like that,” said Tito Carvalho, who owns a car stereo business in Fort Lauderdale and estimated the water was 3 feet (less than a meter) deep in some places. Some items in his business were damaged from the flooding, he added.

Firefighters pulled a person from a car that had driven into a canal Sunday night in Lauderhill, north of Miami. The patient was hospitalized in critical condition, authorities said.

“It was far worse than we could’ve ever imagined, and we were prepared,” said Arbie Walker, a 27-year-old student whose Fort Lauderdale apartment was filled with 5 or 6 inches (13 to 15 centimeters) of water.

“It took us 20 minutes to navigate out of our neighborhood due to the heavy flooding in our area,” Walker added. Floodwaters also submerged half of his sister’s car.

As much as 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) of rain damaged one of the state’s largest COVID-19 testing sites, at Miami-Dade County’s Hard Rock Stadium, officials said. Throughout the pandemic, it has been one of the busiest places for people to get a coronavirus diagnosis. The site was expected to be closed until Wednesday or Thursday.

All of the testing sites in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties managed by the state government closed on Sunday and Monday due to the storm. At least seven testing sites were to remain closed Tuesday.

Eta hit land late Sunday as it blew over Lower Matecumbe, in the middle of the chain of small islands that form the Keys.

Forecasters said Eta’s system is likely to weaken as it slowly moves up the southwest Gulf Coast, but some models show it strengthening into a larger storm. It is just far enough offshore to maintain a bit of strength while dumping vast amounts of water across the lower third of the Florida peninsula. It did show signs of weakening Monday afternoon, but forecasts beyond 72 hours were unclear.

In Key Biscayne, an island off Miami, some streets were flooded and tree branches knocked down. Rose Haney, 64, had collected sandbags in preparation for Eta, but the waters only came up to her driveway and did not enter her home.

“There’s puddles everywhere,” Haney said. “You can’t really drive on every street here.”

A banyan tree fell on a house in Key Largo, causing minor injuries, said Fire Chief Don Bock. He said the storm knocked down a few other trees, and scattered power lines were down.

Randi Barry, 36, also woke up Monday to flooded streets outside her home in Fort Lauderdale, and joined her neighbors in helping people whose cars were stuck in high water.

“There are a lot of people with their doors open, getting furniture up to higher ground and trying to get water out of their homes,” Barry said. “Everyone is helping each other out a lot.”

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it a 100-year rain event.

“Once the ground becomes saturated, there’s really no place for the water to go,” Trantalis said. “It’s not like a major hurricane. It’s more of a rain event, and we’re just doing our best to ensure that the people in our community are being protected.”

A tractor-trailer was left dangling off the elevated Palmetto Expressway in Miami, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The driver lost control on the wet, slick road and suffered minor injuries, CBS 4 in Miami reported.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Twitter that Floridians should monitor the storm over the coming days. While this storm has moved offshore, it could still bring dangerous conditions to the Gulf Coast at the end of this week,” he tweeted.

In Cuba, Eta continued to swell rivers and flood coastal zones. Some 25,000 people were evacuated with no reports of deaths, but rainfall continued, with total accumulations of up to 25 inches (63 centimeters) predicted.

Nearly a week after Eta crashed ashore in Nicaragua, authorities from Panama to Guatemala have reported more than 100 dead and an even higher number of missing. Extensive flooding and landslides have affected hundreds of thousands of people in countries already struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic.

Thousands of miles (kilometers) away in the northeast Atlantic, Theta late Monday became the 29th named storm of the basin’s 2020 season. Forecasters said it had developed about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers) southwest of the Azores, packing top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). That system was moving to the east at 15 mph (24 kph) and posed no immediate threat to land.

Trump, who never admits defeat, mulls how to keep up fightBy JILL COLVIN, ZEKE MILLER and JONATHAN LEMIREAssociated PressThe Associated PressWASHINGTON

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump never admits defeat. But he faces a stark choice now that Democrat Joe Biden has won the White House: Concede graciously for the sake of the nation or don’t — and get evicted anyway.

After nearly four tortured days of counting yielded a victory for Biden, Trump was still insisting the race was not over. He threw out baseless allegations that the election wasn’t fair and “illegal” votes were counted, promised a flurry of legal action and fired off all-caps tweets falsely insisting he’d “WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT.”

While some in his circle were nudging Trump to concede graciously, many of his Republican allies, including on Capitol Hill, were egging him on or giving him space to process his loss — at least for the time being.

“Trump has not lost,” declared South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” rejecting the reality of the situation. “Do not concede, Mr. President. Fight hard,” he urged.

Trump is not expected to formally concede, according to people close to him, but is likely to grudgingly vacate the White House at the end of his term. His ongoing efforts to paint the election as unfair are seen both as an effort to soothe a bruised ego and to show his loyal base of supporters that he is still fighting. That could be key to keeping them energized for what comes next.

“He intends to fight,” Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said as it was becoming clear that the president was headed for defeat.

Would Trump ever concede? “I doubt it,” said Trump’s longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, whose prison sentence was commuted by Trump in July. Stone asserted that Biden, as a result, will have “a cloud over his presidency with half the people in the country believing that he was illegitimately elected.”

Allies suggested that if Trump wants to launch a media empire in coming years, he has an incentive to prolong the drama. So, too, if he intends to keep the door open to a possible 2024 comeback — he would be only a year older than Biden is now.

Others in his inner circle egging him on, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor has been promising to provide the president with evidence of voter fraud but has produced little, including during a press conference he held Saturday in the parking lot of a small Philadelphia landscaping company next to an adult bookstore.

Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also urged their father to keep fighting and challenged Republicans to stand with them, as have congressional allies like Graham.

“What I would tell President Trump is: Don’t give up. My advice is do not concede,” said Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona in a podcast interview. “Let’s fight this thing through. It is too important to give up.”

Some in the president’s orbit have been nervously looking toward Capitol Hill for signs of a Republican defection. But so far, most seemed to be giving him time.

“I look forward to the president dealing with this however he needs to deal with it,” Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” Still, he said it was time for Trump “to turn this discussion over to his lawyers, time for the lawyers to make the case that they have, both in court and to the American people, and then we’re going to have to deal with those facts as they’re presented. That has to happen and then we move forward.”

“At this point, we do not know who has prevailed in the election,” said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, telling Fox News he believes Trump “still has a path to victory.”

Other political allies and White House officials, however, have pressed Trump to change his tone and commit to a smooth transition. They’ve emphasized to him that history will be a harsh judge of any action he takes that is seen as undermining his successor. And they have advised him to deliver a speech in the coming week pledging to support the transition.

Trump senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has told others that he is among those who have urged the president to accept the outcome of the race — even if Trump won’t come to terms with how it was reached.

At Fox News, where prime-time hosts wield enormous influence over Trump, Laura Ingraham gave voice to the president’s belief that the election had been unfair, while also pleading with him to keep his legacy in mind — and preserve his status as a GOP kingmaker — by gracefully leaving office.

“President Trump’s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward,” she said Thursday.

This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen Trump aides and allies, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.

That the peaceful transfer of power was even in doubt reflected the norm-shattering habits of the now-lame duck president, who even in victory never admitted that he had lost the popular vote in 2016.

Most aides believed the president would take the weekend to decide on a plan, which will most certainly involve more legal action. But some aides believe the legal skirmishes are more about putting up the appearance of a fight than producing results.

There were some indications Trump was moving in a less contentious direction, even as he continued to angrily complain to aides, reviving old grievances about the Russia investigation that began under President Barack Obama.

In a statement Friday, Trump suggested he would avail himself of every avenue under the law to challenge the election’s result. But allies interpreted it as a begrudging acknowledgement of the likely outcome.

“We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee that the American people have confidence in our government,” he said Trump said. “I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.”

On Saturday, the White House added that the president “will accept the results of a free and fair election” and that the administration “is following all statutory requirements.”

Still, there were concerns that Trump’s rhetoric would inflame tensions in a nation that was already bitterly divided before the election. Isolated scuffles were reported near tabulation centers in Philadelphia and Phoenix.

Pro-Trump protesters — some of them openly carrying rifles and handguns — have rallied outside tallying facilities in several cities around the country, responding to Trump’s groundless accusations that the Democrats were trying to steal the White House.

Biden, meanwhile, has called on the country to come together.

“For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of times myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance,” he said in his Saturday night victory speech.

Trump, whose voluminous Twitter account seems to provide an apt entry for any occasion, offered this advice in 2016: “Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: “In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity,” So true!”

Halted Brazil trials of Chinese-made vaccine cause surpriseBy MAURICIO SAVARESE and DAVID BILLERAssociated PressThe Associated PressSAO PAULO

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s health regulator has halted clinical trials of the potential coronavirus vaccine CoronaVac, citing an “adverse, serious event.”

The decision posted on Anvisa’s website Monday night elicited immediate surprise from parties involved in producing the vaccine.

The potential vaccine is being developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac and in Brazil would be mostly produced by Sao Paulo’s state-run Butantan Institute. Sao Paulo state’s government said in a statement it “regrets being informed by the press and not directly by Anvisa, as normally occurs in clinical trials of this nature.”

Butantan said in a statement that it was surprised by Anvisa’s decision and that it would hold a news conference Tuesday.

Sinovac issued a short statement in China on Tuesday saying it was in touch with Brazilian authorities. “Sinovac will continue to communicate with Brazil on this matter. The clinical study in Brazil is strictly carried out in accordance with GCP requirements and we are confident in the safety of the vaccine,” it said, referring to Good Clinical Practice, a set of international standards for ethics and data quality in clinical research.

It did not offer further details.

The CoronaVac shot has already stirred controversy in Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has cast doubt on its prospective effectiveness. He sparked confusion last month when he publicly rejected it, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. The declaration followed news that his health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, had agreed to purchase CoronaVac doses produced locally by Butantan.

Bolsonaro has often expressed mistrust of China, particularly on the campaign trail in 2018, although he has softened his rhetoric somewhat in office. Also, Sao Paulo state’s Gov. João Doria has become a political rival and an outspoken critic of the president’s pandemic response.

Anvisa said in its statement that the event prompting the trial’s suspension occurred Oct. 29, without saying what transpired.

“With the interruption of the study, no new volunteer can be vaccinated,” its statement said.

Dimas Covas, who leads Butantan, said on TV Cultura late Monday that a volunteer had died, but that the person’s death was not due to the shot.

“We found this Anvisa decision strange, because it is unrelated to the vaccine. There are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment,” he said.

Temporary halts of drug and vaccine testing are relatively common. In research involving thousands of participants, some are likely to fall ill. Pausing a study allows researchers to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence. Last month, two drugmakers resumed testing of their prospective coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. after they were halted earlier.

CoronaVac is being tested in seven Brazilian states, plus the federal district where the capital Brasilia lies.

Following the imbroglio last month surrounding the CoronaVac shot, Anvisa authorized the import from China of 6 million doses. The potential vaccine cannot be administered to Brazilians as it isn’t yet approved locally, the agency said at the time.

Earlier Monday, Sao Paulo state’s health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, said the first 120,000 CoronaVac shots would arrive at Sao Paulo’s international airport Nov. 20.

“We will keep following health protocols to give the shots. They will only be taken to the public after a final authorization from Brazil’s health regulator,” Gorinchteyn said.

The secretary added that nearly all of the volunteers who were given two doses of the vaccine produced antibodies thought to protect people from the virus.

Sao Paulo is also importing raw material for the production of 40 million CoronaVac shots, which is due to start arriving Nov. 27.

Iran’s PressTV quoted Khatibzadeh and his superior, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, hoping the results of the American election would prove devastating to Iran’s regional rivals in Saudi Arabia:

[Khatibzadeh] cited Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as warning regional countries against “taking the gamble to buy security from psychopaths, who only think of money and arms.” Khatibzadeh then reminded how Zarif had also warned that taking such a risk was like “placing one’s eggs in an unsafe basket.” In 2017, Trump signed a whopping $110-billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia during his maiden foreign visit. Two years later, the US State Department approved weapons sales to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s dedicated regional allies, worth almost $6 billion. Observers say Trump’s loss in the polls has likely given rise to some questions about the future of these agreements and the quality of the regional countries’ US ties under his successor Joe Biden.

“Some neighboring countries are still thinking about buying security and loyalty and are focusing on lobbying operations in other countries,” Khatibzadeh grumbled, singling out Israel, which he described as “very much warlike” but primarily interested in waging wars “at the expense of American troops’ blood.”

“All of Israel’s existence and reputation consists of creating crisis,” he charged.

According to PressTV, Iran spent the past four years constructively advising regional powers to “seek out security solutions within the region itself,” while President Donald Trump indulged the “hostility” of the Saudis and condoned their “atrocities” as he unfairly maintained “huge pressure” on Tehran.

The Trump administration pushed ahead with several large arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the past few years, citing the growing regional threat of Iran. Those sales encountered domestic political opposition from critics of Saudi Arabia’s intervention in the Yemeni civil war. Iran has been caught supplying weapons to the Houthi insurgency in Yemen in violation of international law, including shipments of advanced anti-aircraft missiles.

Foreign Minister Zarif hailed the reported victory of challenger Joe Biden in several Twitter posts, hitting the same themes Khatibzadeh outlined:

The American people have spoken. And the world is watching whether the new leaders will abandon disastrous lawless bullying of outgoing regime—and accept multilateralism, cooperation & respect for law. Deeds matter most Iran's record: dignity, interest & responsible diplomacy. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) November 8, 2020

A sincere message to our neighbors: Trump's gone in 70 days But we'll remain here forever Betting on outsiders to provide security is never a good gamble We extend our hand to our neighbors for dialog to resolve differences Only together can we build a better future for all. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) November 8, 2020

“Trump is gone, and we and our neighbors will stay,” Zarif said in another tweet written in Arabic. “Relying on foreigners does not bring security; it rather destroys hope. We extend our hands to our neighbors for cooperation to realize the common interests of our peoples and countries.”

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the American election a “spectacle” and “example of the ugly face of liberal democracy in the U.S.” He claimed it illustrated the “definite political, civil, and moral decline of the U.S. regime.”

Iran’s secular chief executive, President Hassan Rouhani, told state media on Sunday that victory for Joe Biden would offer “an opportunity for the next U.S. government to make up for past mistakes and return to the path of adhering to international commitments with respect to global rules.”

Rouhani cited the election as proof that America’s “maximum pressure” campaign of “imposed economic war” against Iran has failed.

Amos Hochstein, a former senior aide to Joe Biden, said on Sunday he expected returning to the Iran nuclear deal will be “high on his agenda.”

“I believe that in the first months, we’ll either see him rejoin the deal fully, or what I would call ‘JCPOA-minus,’ meaning lifting sanctions in exchange for suspending some of the Iranian nuclear programs in the past three years,” Hochstein predicted, as quoted by the Times of Israel."
650,2020-11-09 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/11/09/nuremberg-preserves-nazi-past-stone-by-stone/,"Nuremberg Preserves Nazi Past, Stone by Stone","Nuremberg (Germany) (AFP) — When Nazi ruins begin to crumble, is it better for Germany to rip them down or restore them?

That is the question now facing Nuremberg, site of the infamous vast marching grounds and torchlit parades immortalised by filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.

As it prepares to mark the 75th anniversary of the post-war trials of Adolf Hitler’s top henchmen, the city has opted to throw itself into a massive conservation effort tied to Germany’s vaunted culture of remembrance and atonement for past crimes.

“This is where it all began: the destruction, the exclusion and in the end, the Holocaust” in which the Nazis slaughtered six million European Jews, Julia Lehner, the southern city’s chief culture official, told AFP.

Touring the sweeping Nazi party rally grounds, Lehner pointed out the massive Zeppelin grandstand where Hitler from 1933 to 1938 delivered racist tirades to half a million party faithful who gathered there every September.

Tens of thousands more Germans from across the country joined in to witness the giant dance spectacles and colour guards.

Nearby, another ruin looms.

The classical Congress Hall, never completed, is the second largest Nazi-era building still standing, after the Prora recreation complex on the Baltic Sea.

Its “monumentality” was intended, like so many architectural relics from the era, to “intimidate and fascinate” while “demonstrating the superiority of Nazi ideology”, historian Wolfgang Benz told AFP.

– ‘Veil of forgetting’ –

The site, largely designed by Hitler’s chief architect Albert Speer and occupying a full 11 square kilometres (four square miles), provides useful insights into “the persecutors”, said Lehner.

She recalled that Hitler handpicked Nuremberg as the staging ground for his sophisticated propaganda machine.

That was one of the prime reasons the Allies chose the city for the groundbreaking hearings to prosecute top Nazis from November 1945.

The dark heritage weighed on the city for decades.

“Immediately after the war, it was preferred to cover it all with a veil of forgetting,” Lehner said.

Zeppelin Field with its stone bleachers opposite the grandstand were long used as sporting grounds for US soldiers and later rock concerts by the likes of Bob Dylan.

Today what remains — officially listed as a historical monument — is in a state of dangerous disrepair.

Many of the familiar landmarks are inaccessible due to the risk of crumbling edifices injuring visitors.

The Congress Hall is closed to the public too. Its ground floor acts as a warehouse for the small huts that make up Nuremberg’s world-famous Christmas market, while an annex is used for storage by the Philharmonic Orchestra.

Since 2001, a documentation centre on the sidelines of the grounds serves to provide historical context.

– ‘Making the stones talk’ –

After two decades of often bitter debate, Nuremberg decided to restore the site by 2025, with the 85-million-euro ($100-million) cost shared by the city, the state of Bavaria and the federal government.

The sum will first and foremost serve to prevent further structural erosion of the buildings.

The field will be converted into a park and signs will explain the history and significance of each building.

The documentation centre, which welcomes 300,000 visitors a year, will be expanded.

It’s about “making the stones speak”, Lehner said, “by telling their history and always insisting that cannot be allowed to happen again”.

The Congress Hall is slated to eventually become a home to artists’ studios.

Nuremberg’s Jewish community has embraced the plans.

“It’s a good basis for showing people from around the world and young people… about the totalitarian ideology these buildings incarnate,” its president, Jo-Achim Hamburger, told AFP.

– A particular ‘satisfaction’ –

As Germany confronts a resurgence of anti-Semitism and the far right openly challenges the country’s post-war practice of atonement, such vestiges of the past have a key role to play, preservation advocates argue.

Many, such as Berlin’s Tempelhof airport or Hermann Goering’s aviation ministry — today, the German finance ministry — immediately found new uses after the war, partially obscuring their historical meaning.

Not everything was suited for conservation.

“The conflict is always the same: could a site become a shrine for neo-Nazis? If the answer is yes, you have to destroy it,” said Benz, citing Hitler’s bunker in Berlin which was paved over and since 2006, marked with a sign.

Nuremberg’s party rally grounds faced similar questions but only the giant swastika above the grandstand was demolished by the Americans — the right decision, said Florian Dierl, director of the documentation centre.

After all, he said, part of remembrance culture when it comes to the Nazi period is about understanding why “the Germans remained true to the regime all those years”.

“By coming here, you can get an idea of the attraction that the notion of a National Socialist community had on the population,” he said.

The massive stones also continue to serve as a warning.

“If you destroy that history, you might lose the chance to truly make visible the dangers of totalitarianism,” Hamburger said.

In 2014, Holocaust survivor Leon Weintraub made a similar plea on a visit to Nuremberg.

“I feel a special satisfaction standing in the face of this expression of megalomania,” he said. “I don’t feel like a victim, I feel like a winner.”"
651,2020-11-08 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/11/08/first-plane-israeli-tourists-lands-uae-peace-deal/,First Plane with Israeli Tourists Lands in UAE After Peace Deal,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The first flight carrying Israeli tourists to the United Arab Emirates landed Sunday in the city-state of Dubai, the latest sign of the normalization deal reached between the two nations.

FlyDubai flight No. FZ8194 landed at Dubai International Airport just after 5:40 p.m., bringing the tourists to the skyscraper-studded city after a nearly three-hour trip. The low-cost carrier had sent one of its Boeing 737s to Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv earlier Sunday morning to pick up the passengers.

The flight flew across Saudi Arabia and then over the waters of the Persian Gulf to reach the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms also home to Abu Dhabi.

The flight, put together by an Israeli company called Gaya Tours, saw Jewish Israelis and a number of Arab Israelis on board. Many of the Jewish Israelis wore kippah head coverings.

Many of the people on the flight said it was not their first time to the UAE, but all said they were excited to be in Dubai. The tourists were joined by a number of businessmen eager for opportunities in the Emirates.

“There is no doubt that the normalization between Israel and the UAE will bring good things and benefit to the Arabs inside Israel. There is no doubt about that,” said Hussein Suleiman, the head of an Arab businessmen’s delegation on board the flight. “We are supportive of this deal and of the normalization, and we are here today to normalize the normalization in reality.”

The arrival of tourists comes as Dubai in particular tries to revive its vital tourism industry amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The UAE and Israel have agreed to launch regular commercial flights between their countries soon, while other recent flights have carried business and governmental delegations.

FlyDubai plans to begin its flights to Tel Aviv later this month. The airline described Sunday’s flight as a “commercial charter flight” for the incoming tourists, without elaborating.

It comes as Israel and the UAE, which had maintained covert contacts for years, brought their diplomatic relationship out into the open. It signed a normalization deal with Israel alongside Bahrain at a White House ceremony in September, making the them the third and fourth Arab nations to currently have peace with Israel.

But while Egypt and Jordan earlier signed peace deals, the UAE has said it anticipates having a “warm” peace with Israel. The Emirates also hopes the deal with aid its efforts to purchase advanced F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. The deals also unite three nations that remain suspicious of Iran.

However, the agreements did not address the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, who view the pacts as a stab in the back from their fellow Arabs and a betrayal of their cause for a Palestinian state. The agreements, which were seen as a foreign policy win for President Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 3 election, now face the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden."
652,,http://www.breitbart.com/news/warmest-human-spirit-uks-former-chief-rabbi-sacks-dies/,‘Warmest Human Spirit’: UK’s Former Chief Rabbi Sacks Dies,"LONDON (AP) — Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi in the U.K. who reached beyond the Jewish community with his regular broadcasts on radio, has died at 72.

A statement on his Twitter page said he died early Saturday.

Sacks served as the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, the figurehead of British Jews, for 22 years, stepping down in 2013.

He was succeeded by the current chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who said the world had lost an “intellectual giant who had a transformative global impact.”

For many people in the U.K., Sacks was best known for his regular broadcasts on the “Thought of the Day” fixture on BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program, the network’s flagship morning news program.

Mohit Bakaya, the controller of the radio channel, said Sacks was a man of “great intellect, humanity and warmth,” whose contributions to the “Thought of the Day” segment were “some of the most erudite.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined in the tributes to Sacks, saying his leadership had a “profound impact on our whole country and across the world.”

Tony Blair, who was prime minister for much of the time that Sacks was chief rabbi, described him as “a man of huge intellectual stature but with the warmest human spirit.”"

“There has never been anything worse than the Trump era. Salvation from it is an achievement,” said Nabil Shaath, a senior advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and a former PA foreign minister.

Senior Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi celebrated what she called a “detrumped” United States.

“Trumpism must be carefully scrutinized & remedied to restore the human, moral & legal equilibrium within and beyond the U.S.. Such phenomena do not emerge from a vacuum,” she said.

“Now is the time for holistic & bold therapeutics,” Ashrawi said in a statement.

“We don’t expect miraculous transformation, but at least we expect the dangerous destructive policies of Trump to totally stop,” Ashrawi, who is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s Executive Committee, went on.

“They should change course and deal with the Palestinian question on the bases of legality, equality and justice and not on the basis of responding to special interests of pro-Israeli lobbies or whatever,” she added.

Both statements, notably, stopped short of congratulating Biden.

If Democrat Joe Biden wins the election, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will walk back promises to hold elections for the first time in 14 years, a former PA advisor said. https://t.co/jRz5FYhNMh — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 4, 2020

Last week, apparent vice president-elect Kamala Harris told The Arab American News that under a Joe Biden administration, the U.S. will work to restore ties with the Palestinians which the latter severed under the Trump administration. Harris said Biden will reopen the Palestinians diplomatic mission in Washington and renew humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians.

She added that Biden was committed to the two-state solution. Biden is also likely to oppose Israeli government steps to apply sovereignty over the West Bank.

“If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us… and the whole world,” PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said before the elections.

Exiled Fatah Mohammad Dahlan, tipped as a successor to Abbas, praised Biden’s win as “a positive development which will put an end to the many dangers of the Trump-Netanyahu alliance to the Palestinian cause, as well as providing new horizons to the path of a new peace based on the two-state solution, as Biden promised personally during the campaign.”

“The end of Trump’s danger is not enough. It is upon us, first of all, to deal with the internal defects and end [political] division and elect legitimate leaders and frameworks who can confront changing developments,” he said according to the Times of Israel.

Hamas terror chief Ismail Haniyeh, with no apparent irony, called the Trump administration “extremist.”

“Our Palestinian people have suffered in prior decades from the bias of American administrations in favor of the occupation, and the Trump administration was the most extremist when it came to supporting the occupation over the national rights of the Palestinian people,” said Haniyeh.

“We call on President-elect Joe Biden to perform a historic correction to American policies which wronged our people, and which made the United States an accomplice to injustice and aggression, and which harmed regional and global stability,” Haniyeh added.

Senior Hamas official Khaled Mashaal said: “An evil has distanced itself from us with the end of the Trump administration.”

He added his hope that Abbas “will not hurry to agree to return to the pointless path of negotiations with the election of Biden.”"

“Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Joe, we’ve had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel,” Netanyahu wrote on his personal Twitter account at 7 a.m. in Israel, which was midnight EST.

“I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the US and Israel.”

Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Joe, we’ve had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel. — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) November 8, 2020

Minutes later, Netanyahu posted a second tweet thanking President Donald Trump “for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights.”

Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights. — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) November 8, 2020

His office has yet to issue a formal statement. Netanyahu came under fire for waiting longer than other world leaders and Israeli lawmakers in responding to Biden’s win.

Rivlin issued a statement at the same time as Netanyahu’s tweet. “I send the blessings of the Israeli people and of the State of Israel, to our friend Joe Biden on your election as the 46th President of the United States of America. I also send congratulations and best wishes for your success, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,” he said. “Mr President-elect, as a long-standing friend of Israel, you are now the leader of the free world and of the State of Israel’s closest and most important ally. The strategic alliance between our two countries and peoples is stronger than any political leadership, and is not based solely on friendship. It is rooted deeply in our shared values and in our long-standing commitment to freedom and democracy as the foundations of our societies.” Rivlin thanked Trump for “four years of partnership in strengthening Israel’s security, and to thank the American people for their steadfast support and friendship.” “I have no doubt that our special relations and multifaceted cooperation will continue to flourish and grow in the future,” he went on. “On behalf of the Israeli people, I wish you and your future administration great success, and extend my invitation to you to visit Jerusalem as our guest.” Opposition leader Yair Lapid, who was the first Israeli politician to congratulate Biden on Saturday evening, slammed Netanyahu for waiting more than 12 hours to respond to news of the Biden victory. Lapid said silence from Netanyahu showed “cowardice and was shameful” and “hurts Israeli interests.” “If the French president, German chancellor and British prime minister can do it, so can you,” Lapid said. Leader of the leftwing Meretz party Nitzan Horowitz called Netanyahu’s hiatus “disgraceful.” Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz congratulated Biden and Harris on Twitter in the early hours of Sunday morning. “As the election results become final, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to @JoeBiden, a long-time supporter and friend of Israel, and to his running mate, @KamalaHarris, who has made history as the first woman elected VP.” Gantz tweeted in English at around 4 a.m. Israel time, just as Biden was delivering his victory speech. “I look forward to continuing to deepen the steadfast bond and strong defense ties between our peoples, as allies in the effort to strengthen democracy, stability, and peace worldwide,” added Gantz, who is alternate prime minister and slated to replace Netanyahu in November 2021, 11 months after Biden is set to take office. Gantz added that the country was “immensely grateful” to Trump for being “committed to [Israel’s] security and invested in its future.” “The Middle East has taken major steps forward thanks to the president’s bold leadership over these four years, and for that we are immensely grateful,” he wrote. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi tweeted his congratulations early Sunday morning. “The President-elect’s friendship and distinguished record of support for Israel dates back nearly half a century,” tweeted Ashkenazi. “I strongly believe that under his leadership the strategic indispensable alliance between our two countries will continue to flourish and prosper.”

Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said: “Joe Biden has been a friend of Israel since he was first elected to the Senate in 1972. I congratulate you, Mr. President-Elect, on gaining the trust of the American people. I am sure that our fruitful cooperation will continue during your time as well, including in the joint fight against COVID-19.”"

The U.S. held its presidential election on November 3. Initial results showed U.S. President Donald Trump held a lead over challenger Joe Biden. As polls closed on election night, Trump was poised to lead in key states. By the next morning on November 4, Trump’s lead had diminished, the result of mounting mail-in ballots that favored Biden, observers said. Multiple states expanded mail-in voting this year in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Republicans have since protested that legally authorized poll watchers have allegedly been prevented from observing the ballot counting process at designated centers and the Trump administration has said it has received reports of voter fraud across multiple states.

The president’s lawyers have filed lawsuits in some states to halt the ballot counting process after Election Day and to demand a recount. They are currently organizing an official legal challenge to the alleged voter fraud. Trump vowed on November 5 in a speech at the White House that his legal team would take the challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.

“This election is not over,” Trump 2020 Campaign General Counsel Matt Morgan said in a statement on Friday.

Reacting to the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the ongoing U.S. presidential election on November 4, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called U.S. democracy a “spectacle” in a statement on Twitter.

What a spectacle! One says this is the most fraudulent election in US history. Who says that? The president who is currently in office. His rival says Trump intends to rig the election! This is how #USElections & US democracy are. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) November 4, 2020

U.S. national security officials on October 21 said that Iran was attempting to interfere in the November 3 presidential election by sending threatening emails to Democrat voters with the aim of damaging efforts to reelect Trump.

“We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran, and separately by Russia,” U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said at a press conference. He was joined by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray.

“This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to convey misinformation,” Ratcliffe said.

“We have already seen Iran sending spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump,” he explained.

The Trump administration has led a campaign of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic Republic, pulling the U.S. out of a 2015 multilateral deal that offered Tehran billions in sanctions relief if it agreed to curb its nuclear program. On September 21, the Trump administration reimposed U.N. sanctions on Iran meant to deter its nuclear proliferation. In addition, the administration imposed “new sanctions and export controls on more than two dozen entities and individuals that support Iran’s nuclear, missile, and conventional arms-related activities.”

Biden has stated that should he become the next U.S president, his administration would rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which was solidified while he was vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama."
656,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/06/iran-announces-election-results-americans-lose/,Iran Announces Election Results: ‘Americans Lose’,"Iran’s state-controlled PressTV outlet ran a column Friday concluding that a loss for President Donald Trump was a “win for duopoly,” meaning America’s free election system, and that no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election, “Americans lose.”

PressTV and other Iranian state media outlets have invested significant time in “analysis” pieces that conclude that the American people are repressed, their votes do not matter, and that only a revolution will save America. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted the collapse of America in its entirety in remarks on Election Day, citing a lack of morality in the country.

Iran is an Islamic theocracy that uses criminal law to punish dancing, women showing their hair, “blasphemy,” and any political dissent. While Iran does hold elections, Khamenei gets to choose who appears on the ballot, preventing the public from having any legitimate choice.

PressTV insisted on Friday, however, that Americans are the ones truly disenfranchised.

“’Democracy with American characteristics’ in the 21st century,” PressTV asserted, paraphrasing the Communist Party’s slogan “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” “means a never-ending duopoly, where citizens go to boarded up polling places on streets emptied of civilians but full of security forces, as if they are going to war and not just to vote like a normal person.”

“Because Trump posed a threat to the duopoly, they and their 1% allies absolutely freaked out in 2016 and spent four years throwing everything they had at him to boot him out by any means necessary. The cost was absolutely enormous on a cultural level,” the propaganda outlet asserted.

PressTV defended Trump as a representative of anti-establishment sentiment, but diagnosed that sentiment as a clamor for a multi-party system like those common in Europe, a claim for which the outlet did not present any evidence from polls or any other indications.

“You can dislike it all you want, but Trumpism is obviously a genuine, authentic movement, and 2020 confirms it was even a successful one,” PressTV asserted. “Call it the Flatworm Phenomenon: Democrats may succeed in chopping off the head but the body will undoubtedly live, election results prove.”

Trump’s supporters did not support Trump, who the article dismissed as narcissistic and amoral, but rather, appreciated that he validated that they felt “scammed and disgusted by the decisions of the political and cultural elite over the past 30 years,” the Iranian outlet continued.

Ultimately, the article concludes, Trump’s crusade to “drain the swamp” was “obstructed by his own nonsense” and “the only winners in the American duopoly are the richest 1%, of course, not ever a grassroots anything.”

This analysis complements an opinion piece published Wednesday that declared no American votes make a difference in how the country is run because they do not trigger a revolution that fundamentally changes the character of the regime.

“It’s when the rest of the world gets to find out who will be dropping the bombs the next time because that’s really what it means to millions of people around the world. Also, be careful, your vote is important. If you vote for the wrong guy US policy could fall into the hands of warmongers. That’s a joke because it’s like a trick question,” the column read, calling anyone who believed in voting “ridiculous.”

Khamenei himself weighed in on the elections on Tuesday, asserting that Iran had no preference between Trump and rival Joe Biden and that he expected America itself to collapse soon due to its “moral deviations.” While Khamenei insisted that neither option was preferable to his regime, his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, asserted that Biden was “more promising” to it. Under President Barack Obama, who Biden served as vice president, Iran made billions of dollars from the end of sanctions that followed the Iran nuclear deal.

“The statements by the Biden camp have been more promising, but we will have to wait and see,” Zarif said while on a tour of Venezuela. “What is important for us is how the White House behaves after the election, not what promises are there, what slogans are made. The behavior of the U.S. is important. If the U.S. decides to stop its malign behavior against Iran, then it will be a different story no matter who sits in the White House.”

In remarks similar to Khamenei’s on Friday, an Iranian general claimed that Tehran was preparing for the possibility of the United States becoming unstable as the final results of the election remain in doubt.

General Yadollah Javani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, told Iran’s Tasnim news agency that the “possibility of deepening crisis and eruption of civil unrest” in America was high.

“The US authorities and Police officials themselves have admitted that America needs to brace for post-election turmoil, General Yadollah Javani said,” according to Tasnim. “The fact that the security forces in major American states have been put on alert reveals the depth of the possible crisis, the IRGC general noted."

Pakistan’s The News reported on Friday that Khan’s slogan came up during a meeting with Bosnian leader Sefik Dzaferovic.

Khan expressed “brotherly affinity with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina” and thanked Dzaferovic for Bosnia’s assistance during Pakistan’s 2005 earthquake and 2010 floods. He also thanked Dzaferovic for Bosnia’s support of Pakistan’s position against India in the disputed province of Kashmir.

According to The News, Khan told Dzaferovic that India has been “taken over by a fascist and extremist ideology” that is persecuting Muslims worldwide — including in France, which Khan denounced for insisting that its citizens are free to say things that hurt the feelings of Muslims.

“Both of us condemned the terrorist acts by Muslims in France, like all other countries would condemn them. But at the same time, we felt that for inter-religious harmony, it is important that the freedom of expression is not used as an instrument to hurt the feelings of any religious community,” Khan said of his meeting with Dzaferovic.

“Any insult, ridicule and mocking of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) causes the greatest pain to the Muslims community. The European powers and Western countries must understand that you can’t use freedom of expression as a weapon to cause Muslims the pain by insulting our Prophet (PBUH),” he explained.

“Unless this is understood, the cycle of violence will keep happening; there will be provocations, Muslims will react,” he warned. “There will be a reaction against the Muslims living in Western countries and especially in France, which will lead to marginalisation and more radicalism and the cycle will continue unless there is an understanding and respect for sentiments of every religious community and specifically Muslims living in Europe.”

Pakistan has laws against blaspheming Islam, including the death penalty. The blasphemy laws were adapted from British colonial codes in India that criminalized disrupting religious assemblies or insulting religious beliefs.

Pakistan modified these protections for all religious faiths during the 1980s to “Islamicize” them, and specifically to exclude the Ahmadis, an Islamic sect considered heretical by many other Muslims because they believe their founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet like Mohammed. The second amendment to the Pakistani constitution was passed in 1974 with the sole purpose of legally classifying Ahmadis as non-Muslims.

Efforts to amend Pakistan’s blasphemy laws to either liberalize them or extend their protections to religions besides Islam have been attempted for decades, without success. The last Pakistani politician of any great stature to criticize the blasphemy laws, Punjab governor Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated in 2011 by Mumtaz Qadri, one of his police bodyguards. A significant political party was founded in Qadri’s honor after his execution in 2016.

Islamic religious leaders applauded Taseer’s murder using exactly the same logic as Prime Minister Khan’s remarks on Thursday.

“Salmaan Taseer was himself responsible for his killing. Any Muslim worth the name could not tolerate blasphemy of the Prophet, as had been proved by this incident,” Munawar Hasan, the head of one of Pakistan’s largest Islamic religious parties, said in 2011.

Contrary to his claim that he thinks every religion should be protected from hurtful words or blasphemous statements, Khan has given speeches insulting to Christianity and Judaism since he remodeled himself as a devout Muslim during his rise to power. After launching his political career, the former cricket star and playboy became a fiery defender of Pakistan’s laws against blaspheming Islam, including the death penalty, dismaying international observers who hoped he might become a liberalizing force. Human rights advocates blame Pakistan’s blasphemy laws for inspiring dozens of vigilante murders.

“My father was a hero and a champion for change. He wanted amendments in this barbaric law. Imran Khan is a coward; he is supporting murderers and mob violence. This law is persecuting people, it is not respecting our prophet,” Salmaan Taseer’s son Shabaz said in 2018.

Writing at the left-leaning Haaretz on Sunday, Pakistani journalist Kunwar Khuldune Shahid blasted Khan and Turkey’s like-minded prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for “hypocrisy” in claiming they seek protection for all religions instead of special privileges for Muslims. He castigated both for casually smearing critics of political Islam by comparing them to Nazis, as Khan did again during his meeting with the Bosnian leader a few days later.

Shahid denounced Khan and Erdogan’s arguments as another manifestation of anti-Semitism since they are both implying that Jews have arranged special protection against Holocaust denial through sinister means. He was especially disappointed in Khan for using these rhetorical tactics because he was once married to a Jewish woman and is often smeared as a “Jewish agent” by his hardline Islamist critics. He further excoriated Khan for complaining about free speech in France while ignoring Communist China’s brutal persecution of the Uyghur Muslims.

“Pakistan and Turkey’s use of the Holocaust for point-scoring, and the implied justification of violent reactions to ‘anti-Islamic’ blasphemy, underlines a more general failure of Muslim leaders to understand the basic concept of free speech, or even their own duplicitous claims of ‘double standards,’” Shahid wrote.

“Blasphemy is a capital offense only in Muslim-majority countries. 12 Muslim-majority states have established the death penalty with 20 others establishing prison sentences. And lest one thought the idea was to protect all people of faith — these offenses are all Islam-specific, and the laws do not stipulate similar punishments for sacrilege against other religions,” he observed.

“The truth is, if these Muslim leaders fail to see the duplicity of their demands for the exclusive protection of Islam from satire, their own boosting of bigotry, their equation of blasphemy with the genocide of Jews and their implicit endorsement of the righteousness of violent retaliation, then there is no way they should ever be given any veto power over free speech,” Shahid concluded."

“Our missiles make our enemies shiver and force them into retreat … And if need be, this fearsome program will impose our political will upon them,” the confident Salami said.

He issued a warning to foreign adversaries.

“Our enemies are facing a decline in power, and with each passing day, the slope of this decline is accelerating,” Salami said, “but the enemy’s threats still remain.”

As such, he argued, the Iranian armed forces “must be very careful and vigilant and increase our talent, capacity, defense and deterrence”—areas in which the latest missile system could help.

Videos of the system have emerged showing a facility in which groups of missiles ready to fire are moved using an automated railway system.

The quasi-official Iran’s Military Achievements Media states on its YouTube channel that wagons carrying ballistic and long-range missiles “can create continuous shooting conditions” in this system, and that the quantity and continuity of the missile will “increase impressively” in a safe atmosphere.

The new system is also said to have been made entirely in Iran and is just the latest in a string of military advances claimed by the country and its military elite.

Iran General Hossein Salami said he seeks revenge against the U.S. that ""will be hard, firm, regrettable, decisive and complete."" https://t.co/9xWXPX0JEW — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 7, 2020

The location of the facility in the latest videos and photos has not been confirmed, but Iran has built underground caves to protect ballistic missiles in the past, and has released imagery that showed long lines of ballistic missiles on launchers.

That process seems to have been augmented with the automated railway system, which could potentially allow more missiles to be fired from a single bunker, experts say.

On multiple occasions in recent years, Iran has fired those missiles against different targets, most notably in January, when over a dozen of them landed on the U.S.-run Ain al-Asad air base in neighboring Iraq.

The attack was Iran’s response to the killing of its top general Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike, as Breitbart News reported.

Referring to Donald Trump as “the gentleman in the White House,” Rouhani said the president “ruthlessly increased sanctions” on Tehran, essentially declaring “economic war” while the country battled against the COVID-19 crisis.

“They [the U.S.] did not adhere to any principles: neither human-rights principles nor international law,” Rouhani said, as Breitbart News reported.

“At the same time, I am confident that the Iranian nation will eventually win. It does not matter what the outcome of the U.S. election is tonight or tomorrow, and whose power is in anyone’s hands.”

“There is no doubt that the future U.S. administration will succumb to the will of the Iranian people,” he added.

“They have no choice but to surrender to the law, order and pressure of public opinion and to the patience and resistance of this great nation,” he said.

Speaking during a visit to Venezuela, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the era of “Western hegemony had ended.”

He added that the U.S. had lost the right to “show other countries how to protect citizens’ rights,” the Reuters news wire reported.

“Today, the United States and its allies can’t control what’s happening in the world. They’ve lost control,” Zarif told a forum in Caracas, alongside his authoritarian Venezuelan counterpart, Jorge Arreaza."

Passes Resolution Referring to Temple Mount by Muslim Name Only,"A United Nations General Assembly committee on Thursday adopted a resolution, backed by 139 member states, that referred to Jerusalem’s Temple Mount only by its Muslim name and ignored any connection to Judaism — despite it being the religion’s holiest site.

It was one of seven resolutions that passed Thursday condemning Israel with zero on the entire rest of the world.

The resolution raised concern with “tensions and violence” on “occupied” Palestinian territories, such as “the holy places of Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharifm” — the Muslim name for the holy site.

Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan called the resolution a “disgrace” and an “audacious attempt to rewrite history.”

“It completely ignores any link between the Jewish people and the Temple Mount – our holiest site. This is a disgrace. The audacious attempt to rewrite history will not change the indisputable fact that the Jewish connection to the city of Jerusalem dates back thousands of years.

“They will also not change the fact that today, our connection to Jerusalem is stronger than ever. A growing number of countries are moving their embassies to Jerusalem, our united and undivided capital,” Erdan said.

Malawi this week announced its intention to open a permanent embassy in Jerusalem by the summer of 2021, marking the first African country to do so. The U.S. and Guatemala moved their embassies to Jerusalem and Serbia and Kosovo announced their decision to open embassies in the capital following a normalization deal.

Erdan noted Israel allows all religions had access to Jerusalem’s holy sites. The holy site, known as the Temple Mount to Jews, marks the spot where both the First and the Second Jewish Temple stood. Today the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock Shrine are located there and the site is administered by Jordanian Waqf.

Jews visiting the site are routinely arrested for violating the rule prohibiting non-Muslim prayer with the utterance of Jewish verses or prostration.

“No resolution passed here will change the eternal connection between the Jewish people and the holiest site of our faith – Har HaBayit, the Temple Mount,” said Erdan.

“For years, the Palestinians have promoted language that includes only the Muslim term of “Haram al-Sharif” and purposely excludes the Jewish name – Temple Mount,” he said.

Erdan told U.N. member states their “support has emboldened the Palestinians to not only deny the Jewish connection to these sites, but to deny Muslims access to them, too, while threatening violence. By supporting these resolutions you share responsibility for this behavior.”

Hillel Neuer, head of monitoring group U.N. Watch, called Thursday’s anti-Israel resolution “surreal.”

“The U.N.’s assault on Israel with a torrent of one-sided resolutions is surreal,” said Neuer.

“Just two weeks after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group assaulted Israeli civilians with a barrage of rockets from Gaza—while the U.N.’s General Assembly and Human Rights Council stayed silent—the world body now adds insult to injury by adopting seven lopsided resolutions, whose only purpose is to demonize the Jewish state.”"

Instead he reissued his warning that whoever occupies the Oval Office must get ready to surrender to the might, power and majesty of the Islamic Republic he leads.

In comments at the opening of a municipal water and waste treatment supply project, Rouhani dismissed the U.S. presidential election process before declaring:

It is not important who is elected (U.S.) president, as the next U.S. administration will surrender to the Iranian nation.

Tasnim News Agency reports he then added “the U.S. government has no option but to give in to the law, the pressure of public opinion, and the resistance from the great Iranian nation.”

“Our nation would not buckle under the pressures. We can overcome the enemies and force them to resume honoring the law and regulations,” Rouhani said.

This is no the first time Rouhani has felt the need to comment on the White House and its occupant or boast of Iran’s assumed global supremacy.

Last month he made a similar jibe, saying the next U.S. president must be ready to kneel before Iran and all its might.

As Breitbart News reported, earlier this year he said the Islamic Republic does not “let the autocrats at the White House smile” because of the stern national resolve to thwart “hostility to Iranian people.”

He also boasted production levels stand at an all time high in defiance of comprehensive U.S. sanctions, according to the official IRNA news source."
662,2020-11-04 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/04/iranian-official-students-burn-u-s-flags-at-home-avoid-coronavirus/,Iranian Official to Students: Burn U.S. Flags at Home to Avoid Coronavirus,"Iran has canceled its traditional Student Day march — which commemorates the anniversary of the Iranian seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 — for the first time in nearly 40 years due to coronavirus concerns, London-based Iran International reported on Monday.

The number of new coronavirus cases reported in Iran has surged in recent weeks. The Islamic Republic surpassed its single-day record for both new coronavirus cases and deaths for the second consecutive day on October 12, with over 4,200 new infections and 272 fatalities. The spike led government authorities to announce “tighter restrictions for the hard-hit capital of Tehran. Recently reopened universities and schools, as well as libraries, mosques, cinemas, museums and beauty salons shut down,” the Hindustan Times reported at the time.

In line with the newly re-imposed social distancing, the Acting Head of Iran’s Student Basij Organization, Mojtaba Bastan, announced a new campaign titled “Everyone together [says] down with the USA” for students to commemorate the 1979 U.S. Embassy seizure at home.

Speaking to an Iranian state-run TV news station this week, Bastan, said that “on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m., parents and students should come together to ‘trample on and set fire’ to flags of the U.S., Israel, and France at home, where they can safely play with fire without worrying about catching a deadly virus.”

“In addition, a special website has been created where students are encouraged to upload minute-long videos, adding their names to the statement ‘U.S. must exit [Middle East] region,'” Iran International reported. “The website also features competitions ‘Why Down with the USA?’ and ‘Message to American Soldiers,’ for which students can enter drawings, essays, voice recordings, and video clips.”

Iran’s Student Basij Organization “is one of the five arms of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], consisting of volunteers for a paramilitary unit that roughly translates as ‘mobilization,’ similar to the ‘popular mobilization’ units in Iraq or PMU that Iran backs,” the Jerusalem Post noted on Tuesday.

Basij in February threatened to destroy the tombs of Esther and Mordechai, a Jewish site, in revenge for U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed Middle East Peace Plan. “Three months later, the tombs were set on fire,” according to the newspaper.

Iranian college students supporting the Iranian Revolution seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. The students held 52 U.S. citizens and diplomats hostage for 444 days until January 20, 1981. The embassy remains shuttered today.

A Fortune reporter visited Tehran in 2016 and described an Iran still openly hostile to the U.S.

“It takes just a few minutes on the ground to realize that the revolution is far from dead and that many Iranians still deeply distrust America,” the author wrote.

“In Tehran itself, one tower still has a 100-foot mural showing the American flag with skulls and missiles, and the words ‘Down with the U.S.A.,'” according to the magazine.

“[E]ven today, ‘Death to America’ chants are a staple of Friday prayers,” the reporter added.

Iran has recently suffered from a severe financial fallout from persistent U.S. sanctions on the country. Trump’s administration, on September 21, reimposed U.N. sanctions on Iran meant to deter its nuclear proliferation and additionally imposed “new sanctions and export controls on more than two dozen entities and individuals that support Iran’s nuclear, missile, and conventional arms-related activities.”"
663,2020-11-04 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/04/iran-biden-more-promising-us-trump/,Iran: Joe Biden ‘More Promising’ for Us than Donald Trump,"Iranian officials and analysts agreed this week that former Vice President Joe Biden would be a better U.S. president for Iran’s interests, although they hastened to add that Iran is fully independent of American influence and would remain invulnerable to pressure from President Donald Trump if he wins re-election.

“The statements by the Biden camp have been more promising, but we will have to wait and see,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CBS News in an interview on Monday.

Zarif insisted the government of Iran does not have a preference in the U.S. presidential race and said in any event that the actions of the next administration would matter more than words on the campaign trail.

“What is important for us is how the White House behaves after the election, not what promises are there, what slogans are made. The behavior of the U.S. is important. If the U.S. decides to stop its malign behavior against Iran, then it will be a different story no matter who sits in the White House,” he said.

Zarif added that Iran is not interested in “renegotiating” the Obama administration’s nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from in 2018, but will “find a way to re-engage” if a prospective Biden administration wishes to unconditionally rejoin the deal.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is not a matter of great importance in Tehran.

“Whoever wins the U.S. election is of no significance for us, but it is important that the U.S. return to all international commitments and respect multilateralism,” Rouhani said.

“Our economic decisions have been made over the past few weeks, regardless of what happens in the United States and who is elected,” he declared.

“What is important for us is that the United States respects the Iranian nation. We want respect instead of sanctions. If so, the situation will be different,” Rouhani said.

Iran’s theocratic ruler, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was even more dismissive of the U.S. election’s outcome.

“In relation to America, our policy is measured and clear and this policy does not change with the coming and going of individuals. Today is the election in America, some talk about who comes and who goes, what happens if this person comes and what happens if that person goes,” Khamenei said in an address carried by Iranian state television.

“Some may think that a government can benefit from submitting to the demands of the United States, but the governments that surrendered to American bullying have suffered the most and their troubles have only multiplied,” Khamenei said.

Iran’s PressTV on Tuesday quoted Daneil Kovalik of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law agreeing with the Iranian Foreign Ministry that a change of U.S. presidents might not bring immediate and dramatic change to American relations with Iran, but Biden would clearly be more amenable to restoring the Iran nuclear deal, which is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

“I think that Trump will not want to do that. I mean it’s pretty clear where Trump is headed with this. I think he has no intention of re-entering the JCPOA, and though I do think Biden would be more willing to do that, in part because of course it was agreed to, when he was vice president and he has publicly stated that he is open to re-entering the agreement,” Kovalik told PressTV.

“The two parties are pretty much in agreement on foreign policy and its imperial foreign policy. With that said, you know, there’s always some small differences, and given how powerful the US is, small differences can matter… I think that the Iranian ministry is largely right, but there are minor differences and I think in this case Biden will be more open to talk to Iran than Trump,” he said."
664,2020-11-04 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/04/turkish-pro-erdogan-journalist-victorious-trump-would-crush-enemies-like-a-bulldozer/,Turkish Writer: Victorious Trump Would Crush Foes ‘Like a Bulldozer',"Turkish columnist Ibrahim Karagül, a passionate supporter of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, predicted in the pages of Yeni Safak on Tuesday that no matter which way the hotly contested U.S. presidential election goes, the outcome will not be great for Turkey.

Karagül anticipated a re-elected President Donald Trump would roll over adversaries both foreign and domestic “like a bulldozer,” while he expected Joe Biden to attempt a regime-change operation against Erdogan.

Karagül saw the contentious election as a sign of American social and political decline.

“This election is going to be held during a period in which the world is re-dividing into camps, in which new rising powers have emerged, where the U.S. influence is no longer as strong as it used to be, and the division within the country has taken on a dangerous state,” he argued.

“The U.S. continued to lose power during the last three election terms. This loss is prevalent in every field, including politics, the military, and the economy. The voids caused as a result of this loss have been filled by other powers – and will continue to be filled. We are going to continue to see American influence further weaken in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia,” he wrote.

Karagül proved to be correct in doubting the polls that showed Biden sweeping the election by seven points or more, anticipating the social and political upheavals in America would produce a surprise on par with the “major shock” of Trump’s victory in 2016.

After shrugging off the results as relatively unimportant to Turkey, which is on a “rising streak that continues to shock the West” and has become “one of the new superpowers,” Karagül ventured that Trump would at least bring “strong leadership” – along the lines of Erdogan or Russian President Vladimir Putin – to the U.S. in a second term, while Biden is captive to the “cliches of the old world” and might try to “oust Erdogan.”

Quoting Biden’s comments about supporting the Turkish opposition, Karagül judged this kind of New World Order thinking to be more dangerous than Trump jousting with Erdogan on the fair field of international competition:

They pinned all their hopes onto Biden’s election. He is going to be the U.S. president. He is going to support and strengthen, and bring order to the opposition in Turkey. Hand in hand, they are going to topple Erdoğan! This is their plan; this is what they revealed. They have no other political plan or project up their sleeves; they have nothing to say or offer that will add value to Turkey. This is a complete collapse, a complete exhaustion. They attempted a military coup on July 15, 2016. What is going to happen now if Biden is elected? Are they going to carry out a political coup? What a shame. Then we are going to say that you and those designing Turkey’s opposition through Biden’s candidacy are all part of the same project. Then we are going to say that Turkey’s political opposition was set up in the U.S.

Karagül never quite got around to specifying who “They” are, but his readers are probably familiar with Erdogan’s list of usual suspects – from the followers of exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen, to separatist Kurds, to his dual incarnations of evil on earth, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Emirati Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. Gülen and his followers were held responsible by Erdogan for the 2016 coup attempt Karagül mentioned.

The degree to which Turkey looms in the minds of either Trump or Biden strategists is open to debate, but Erdogan and his supporters would not look kindly upon either of them for supporting the Turkish opposition. On Wednesday, the Turkish government fined Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Periscope, and TikTok over a million dollars apiece for failing to comply with new Turkish laws regulating social media posts.

Internet rights expert Yaman Akdeniz of Bilgi University told the Wall Street Journal he expected foreign social media companies may consider withdrawing entirely from the “hostile environment” in Turkey. With Erdogan supporters now firmly in control of most major Turkish legacy media outlets, it would be very difficult for either a Trump or Biden administration to speak directly to the Turkish opposition."
665,2020-11-04 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/11/04/iranian-state-media-your-vote-doesnt-matter/,Iranian State Media: Your Vote Doesn’t Matter,"A columnist for the Iranian state propaganda network PressTV declared in a column Tuesday, the date of the 2020 presidential election, that Americans live in an “oligarchy” and have no power to choose their leaders.

Pundit Daniel Patrick Welch concluded that the only thing on the ballot this week was “who will be dropping the bombs the next time” and that no material policy differences exist between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Writing in strained attempts at American vernacular, Welch called claims that voting in America was an important civic duty “ridiculous” and that the “rational” world understands that America is not a free country.

Iran is an Islamic theocracy that holds elections in which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei must approve of all candidates. Iran held its last parliamentary elections in February, as the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began spreading there, resulting in both record-low turnouts and skyrocketing coronavirus infection rates.

Welch did not address the status of his employer’s political system in his article, titled “Americans, Desperate for Change, Delude Selves into Thinking Vote Matters.” Instead, the writer used strained attempts at American vernacular to make the point that Tuesday’s election does not matter and Americans are trapped in an authoritarian system where only “warmongers” take the White House.

“Well, we’ll have to see whether that is enough to counter the enormous weight of shaming that went on with the democrats and their foisting Biden on the rest of us. It’s not the most important election in the history of history. It’s ridiculous, and it makes me really angry. When I hear it I just want to shut off the TV, the conversation. Just withdraw because it’s such ado about nothing,” the column read. “Well, we can compromise and say, you know, greatest in the history of mammals, right? The dinosaurs did okay. So we’ll leave them out of it. I don’t know. I can only make jokes about it because I just don’t know how else to react.”

American presidential elections are “when the rest of the world gets to find out who will be dropping the bombs the next time because that’s really what it means to millions of people around the world,” Welch claimed. “Also, be careful, your vote is important. If you vote for the wrong guy U.S. policy could fall into the hands of warmongers. That’s a joke because it’s like a trick question. There is not going to be any of that difference.”

“No matter what people choose they’re deluding themselves. And this always happens. That’s the thing. It’s not a special election,” he argued. “This always happens every four years, people convince themselves that this time it will make a difference. And there’s like a mass hysteria even if the famous Princeton study [no context is provided for what this is] proved that we’re an oligarchy, not a democracy, that people have very, very little power to change the rules that govern them and that power is given mostly or asserted mostly by the elites.”

While condemning American elections using the argument that no material differences exist between Trump and Biden, Welch reserves particular disgust for Trump, calling him “the most perfect distillation of what this country represents that any candidate has ever shown. It’s like he’s a caricature of the American, the Ugly American, except that other presidents have started even more wars and dropped even more bombs.”

He then goes on to predict that Democrats will privatize social security and enact “austerity” in America.

Despite running a column that overtly claims both presidential candidates are the same and implying that Democrats are more conservative than Republicans, PressTV also gave air to the opinion that Biden’s tenure as president would benefit Iran more than Trump’s. Under Trump, America walked out of the Obama-era Iranian nuclear deal, which granted the regime billions of dollars in sanctions regime; imposed even more sanctions in response to Tehran’s sponsorship of terrorism, and eliminated Iran’s most prized terrorist mastermind, Major General Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force. Trump also designated the IRGC, a formal wing of the Iranian military, a terrorist organization.

Biden, a “peace activist” told PressTV, would benefit Iran.

“It seems to me that Biden would be marginally better than Trump for Iran,” a professor identified as Daniel Kovalik told the outlet. “I agree that it largely does not matter who is president in terms of foreign policy. The two parties are pretty much in agreement on foreign policy and its imperial foreign policy. With that said, you know, there’s always some small differences, and given how powerful the US is — small differences can matter.”

“I had a friend who used to say, ‘Dan, the US is like a giant elephant, and if it rolls one way a little bit if you kill 10,000, if it roles the other way maybe it kills less.’ I kind of view it that way,” he added.

In remarks Tuesday, Khamenei, the supreme leader, denied that Iran was rooting for any one particular candidate.

“No matter who wins the U.S. elections, it won’t affect our policy toward the US. Some people talk about what will happen if this or that one is elected. Yes, certain events may happen but they don’t concern us. Our policy is calculated and clear,” Khamenei said. “The U.S. regime suffers from severe political, civil, and moral deviations. This is what their own analysts say. Such a regime won’t last long.”

Federal law enforcement officials announced last month that they identified a scheme by cyber-criminals tied to the Iranian regime sending threatening emails appearing to be from the “Proud Boys,” a male interest collective, meant to embarrass Trump.

The result was the best result for any Republican candidate since the 1988 presidential election.

In a statement, the RJC said (original emphasis):

The poll shows that President Donald Trump won 30.5% of the Jewish vote this year, up 6 points from his 24% share of the Jewish vote in 2016. OF NOTE: In Florida, where the RJC invested over $5 million targeting Jewish voters, the New York Times/AP poll shows that the Jewish vote outperformed the national numbers, with 41% of the Jewish vote going to President Trump, an historic record.

Former Senator Norm Coleman, the RJC national chairman, told a Zoom press briefing Wednesday that “it made a difference for Donald Trump to be the best friend Israel ever had in the White House.” He also praised Trump’s performance on the economy and in fighting antisemitism.

RJC executive director Matt Brooks, who predicted in March that Trump would improve his result among Jewish voters, noted that Trump had improved among Jewish voters despite major obstacles.

“Tthe left and the Jewish Democrats did their best to portray this president as an antisemite … someone who condoned neo-Nazis and white nationalists, which I found offensive,” Brooke said, adding: “So did Jewish voters.”

Trump’s 30% among Jewish voters also matched the pre-election poll of the Jewish Electorate Institute.

An exit poll by J Street, a far-left organization, put Trump’s Jewish support in 2020 far lower, at 21%.

Knesset member Ofer Cassif from the Arab-majority Joint List party said: “Trump has long been proving that he is a danger to his people and the entire world.”

He called the incumbent president “disgusting,” adding that his worldview was “nationalist, fundamentalist, sexist and racist.”

“Zealousness is a contagious disease and this great darkness stands before us here as well,” Cassif said.

Leader of the leftwing Meretz party Nitzan Horowitz said it was outrageous for Trump to declare he had won the election while at the same time objecting to the way counting had been stopped.

As Breitbart News reported, Trump told supporters and the press in the East Room: “This is a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner.” He added: “So we will be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“Four years of Trump’s instability must end for the good of the entire world, especially Israel,” Horowitz said.

“A president who is interested in a real peace process is needed in the White House,” he added.

A poll released last month showed the majority of Israelis (63.3 percent) prefer the reelection of Trump, and almost half (48.2 percent) believe U.S. Jews are “mistaken” in supporting the Democratic Party.

Only 18.8 percent of Israelis said they prefer former Democratic challenger Joe Biden, the poll released by i24News and conducted by the Direct Falls Research Institute showed.

The majority believed Trump will be a more favorable president towards the State of Israel and just over half (50.9 percent) of those surveyed saying a Biden win would harm future relations between the two countries.

More than half (53.2 percent) said the Israeli right would be negatively impacted if Trump didn’t win the elections. Another 21 percent responded that “Israel acts independently,” and the U.S. president wouldn’t influence it.

U.S. election interest among Israelis is very high, with 87.8 percent of respondents saying they were following the contest. Of those, 48.1 percent said that the U.S. elections are very interesting for them and they were following closely, while 39.7 percent answered that they are interesting to a certain extent. Just nine percent expressed little interest in the U.S. elections.

A full 48.2 percent of those polled believe American Jews’ support for Democrats is “wrong,” while 35.5 percent thought support was “right.”

Another 16.3 percent of respondents said they were unsure.

Regarding ties between U.S. and Israeli Jews, 47 percent of respondents said that a rift existed between them but were optimistic about the chances of bridging the divide. A total of 35.3 percent of respondents said their was no rift between the two largest Jewish communities, only legitimate points of disagreement. Barely 12.4 percent of respondents said they believed there was no possible reconciliation between the two communities.

The poll, with a statistical sampling error of + 4.4 percent, was conducted with a sample of 519 adults from all sectors of Israel’s population."

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which primarily operates in Algeria, released a statement this week, saying: “Killing the one who insults the prophet is the right of every Muslim capable of enforcing it.”

The terrorist group went on to state that demands for a boycott of French products by Muslim countries were not enough and called for revenge against France and President Macron, while labelling the killer of teacher Samuel Paty a “martyr”, Le Figaro reports.

‘Not on French Soil’ – Macron Says Islamists Who Want to Follow Anti-Enlightenment Values Should Leave https://t.co/6RXHUiy8J3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 2, 2020

After the death of Paty, who was killed by a jihadist teen refugee for showing his class cartoons of the Islamic prophet Mohammed, President Macron has cracked down on several Islamist-linked groups.

The crackdown has been met with opposition from much of the Islamic world, including Turkey were President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also endorsed boycotts of French products and labelled President Macron as mentally unwell.

The Turkish leader became even more indignant after Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine that printed the Mohammed drawings, published a cartoon aimed at Erdogan himself.

“I didn’t look at this cartoon (…) There is no need to say anything about these scoundrels,” Erdogan said and added: “My anger is not due to the despicable attack on my person, but to the insults against the prophet.”

Al-Qaeda has threatened France many times in the past and was directly linked to the original Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in 2015 that saw the two brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi claim to be members of Al-Qaeda’s group in the Gulf region, Al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula.

Despite threats and protests, President Macron has stood firm on the issue of radical Islamic extremism, stating this week that Islamists who do not respect French values should leave.

“I’m telling you very clearly: not our values! We believe in the Enlightenment, and women have the same rights as men. It is vital. And so, I will never, never, never accept an association, even if it would be in the name of a religion, that would promote [the idea that] a little girl is not the equivalent of a little boy; she will not be given the same education, she will not be given the same opportunities — because it’s not our values,” Macron said.

“People who think like that, let them do it somewhere else, but not on French soil,” he added."

The Jewish Week cited Bonita Nathan Sussman, a 67-year-old from Staten Island, NY, as saying that when she announced she would be voting for Trump, her Facebook friends responded they would hold a virtual shiva, the weeklong Jewish mourning ritual, for her.

“Oh my gosh, have I lost friends,” Nathan Sussman told the paper about her decision to “come out of the closet” as a Trump-supporter.

“I’ve been called a racist, a homophobe, anything you can name under the sun,” she said.

“If you know me,” she continued, “you know those things aren’t true. But people who I’ve had relationships with for over 20 years don’t want anything to do with me anymore.” Orthodox Jews said morning prayers on Sunday before hitting the roads in New York City to rally support for President Donald Trump. https://t.co/VaHvJjdfJx — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 1, 2020 She added that “lots of liberal Jews have crossed over the line,” and are quietly pledging allegiance to the incumbent. “They whisper about it. They’re afraid to lose jobs, friends, family members. If you support Trump in liberal Jewish circles, you become a pariah. You simply can’t say you’re pro-Trump without inviting some kind of a backlash,” she said. According to the latest poll, Joe Biden has a 75-22 advantage over Trump among American Jewish voters. Other interviewees declined to give their names to the newspaper for a variety of reasons including: inciting a “family civil war”; putting a current living arrangement in peril; becoming estranged from a daughter; losing a job or incurring damage to a personal business, and being permanently exiled from their synagogue or intimate social circles. Many of them said they were still leaning left on social issues, but agree with much of the president’s policies, especially regarding his treatment of Israel, Iran and the antisemitism emerging from the new left as well as his handling of calls to defund the police after the riots that plagued the country in May. According to Barbara Braun, a 71-year-old philanthropist from Long Island, her liberal values are not in conflict with her support of the president. “I find it objectionable that people assume there is a conflict.”“There’s a tremendous amount of preconceived notions about what a liberal Jewish person is supposed to think and feel. We live liberal values, we live tzedakah,” she said, using the Hebrew word for charity. “I can’t understand how all that has been called into question over this election.”"

A Biden victory would also see the Palestinians lobby Washington to reopen a diplomatic Palestinian mission after the State Department ordered its shuttering in 2018. Abbas will also bid for the restoration of aid, which was cut over the Palestinians’ policy of paying salaries to terrorists and their families, as well as the reopening of a separate U.S. consulate in eastern Jerusalem.

“Should Biden win, Abbas would likely drop any pretense of elections, regional realignment, and so on and immediately move to reengage with the U.S.,” said Washington Institute senior fellow and former PA advisor Ghaith al-Omari.

Abbas was elected for a four-year term in 2005 but has remained in office ever since and despite several promises to do so over the years, has never called elections.

Abbas may, however, end up disappointed, because according to analysts the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is unlikely to be a high priority for the U.S. going forward.

“Israel and Palestine are not going to be a priority for any new administration. Not because Biden doesn’t care — but he’s in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis. There is a huge range of issues – the restoration of democracy, institutions, health care…I’m not sure how much bandwidth that will leave for Israel-Palestine,” Shibley Telhami, a senior fellow of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, was quoted by the Times of Israel as saying.

Contrary to Abbas, elsewhere in the Middle East Arabs are hoping for a Trump victory.

The lead editorial of the UAE’s The National posited that in the Middle East “Trump’s record is broadly positive.”

His determination to stand up to the menace of Tehran has been commendable. He helped to negotiate the Abraham Accord with the UAE and Israel – potentially a seismic turning-point in the region’s history. ISIS has been tamed, if not yet put down. Sudan has been brought back into the international fold. True, war continues to rage in Syria and Iraq struggles to rid itself of Iranian influence. The recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was inflammatory. But given that this was a President elected on the self-styled promise of ‘America First’, the isolationism that many feared would leave the Middle East abandoned has not materialized.

Days before the election, Bahraini and UAE officials called on moderate American Muslims to cast their votes for Trump, warning that a Biden win could stop further peace deals in the region.

A Bahraini official told Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom that a Trump victory would generate a “flood of moderate Arab and Muslim countries” into signing normalization deals.

He warned, however, that while a Biden victory would not endanger the newly ratified deals with the UAE and Bahrain, it may prevent further deals from happening.

“A Biden victory will see many of the countries that are currently exploring the possibility of normalizing relations [with Israel] take a step back and revisit the risk they are taking.”"
671,2020-11-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/11/03/iran-newspaper-depicts-macron-satan-opposing-beheadings/,Iran: Newspaper Depicts Macron as Satan for Opposing Beheadings,"Iranian state media celebrated Vatan-e Emrooz, an Iranian newspaper with ties to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on Tuesday for publishing a cartoon of French President Emmanuel Macron titled “The Devil of Paris.”

The cartoon depicts Macron as Satan, with pointed ears, a red face, and an elongated nose. It is meant as revenge for Macron’s opposition to the beheading of Samuel Paty, a French schoolteacher, by a teen jihadist last month that occurred after Paty used cartoons of Muhammad in a class about free speech.

Macron has not responded to the cartoon’s publication at press time. He has repeatedly opposed criminalizing any cartoons in public and has not made any indication that his personal appearance in a cartoon would change his opinion.

PressTV noted that Macron’s stance of defending free expression despite potential offense to Muslims resulted in a wave of criticism in Iranian media, which the government tightly controls, even when it does not own the outlet.

“Other Iranian newspapers criticized Macron on the front page. Daily Kayhan demanded that the French ambassador be expelled from Iran in response to Macron’s insolence,” PressTV said.

State news outlets have vocally attacked Macron for his policies limiting the ability of violent jihadists to act in France, including the arrests of dozens of people in the aftermath of Paty’s beheading for publicly praising the killing. Mehr News Agency has published multiple attacks on Macron. In one article published this week, an alleged “human rights activist” called for Macron’s arrest and prosecution.

“Insulting divine religions is a hate crime and hate speech is not freedom of expression in any way. Everything in life has its rules and limits and especially when the repercussions are clearly causing a whole society to fall into divisions and destruction,” Firas Al Najim, the alleged human rights champion, told Mehr, quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.

“Macron should be arrested and prosecuted for hate crimes as he is more accountable than any citizen in France; president and leaders always have more responsibility and accountability than basic citizens.”

“Oh Macron, how much have your idiot reckless and undisciplined statements pushed in the direction of inciting hatred and discrimination in the world and within France?” an Islamic cleric, Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Ahmed Qassim of Bahrain, wrote in a letter to Macron that Mehr also published last week. “If you complain about terrorism, then your statements inflame and ignite the flame of terrorism. A little bit of terrorism is vicious, so why are you igniting it if you hate it?”

Qassim went on to argue that Macron, by refusing to prosecute cartoonists, has declared himself a greater prophet than Muhammad. He then questioned the concept of freedom of speech.

“Can Macron rationally or religiously prove or claim that the general human conscience is both in words and in deeds with freedom without any moral or legal restraints, and without any respect for the set of lofty values, human dignity, and public security?” the cleric asked. “Macron’s freedom opens the door wide to insults, to slander, to mockery, to unlawful crimes, to expose people’s concealed nature and to drop every sanctity.”

Paty was beheaded on October 16 after parents of Muslim students in his class, who Paty told in advance the cartoons would be displayed and allowed to not participate in the class if they were offended, launched a campaign to punish him. Police arrested an 18-year-old Muslim immigrant from Chechnya for the crime and shut down the mosque where the campaign against Paty began. Macron has also moved to empower police to shut down radical Islamist groups in the country and repeatedly vowed never to criminalize speech in the face of violence. He awarded Paty the Legion of Honor, France’s highest civilian award, posthumously.

“[T]here are groups [of] violent extremists who act in the name of Islam and by hijacking religion, who teach, within the framework of associations, using all the freedoms and rights that the [French] Republic offers, that our country offers, they teach that we must not respect France, that we must not respect our law, that we must somehow get out of our laws,” Macron told al-Jazeera in an interview published this weekend.

“They teach that women are not equal to men. They teach that little girls should not have the same rights as little boys. Not our values!” he declared. “I’m telling you very clearly: not our values!”

“We believe in the Enlightenment, and women have the same rights as men. It is vital. And so, I will never, never, never accept an association, even if it would be in the name of a religion, that would promote [the idea that] a little girl is not the equivalent of a little boy; she will not be given the same education, she will not be given the same opportunities — because it’s not our values,” he asserted. “People who think like that, let them do it somewhere else, but not on French soil.”

In addition to outrage in Iran, Bangladesh has experienced multiple waves of protests attracting tens of thousands of men burning Macron in effigy, threatening the French embassy in Dhaka, and calling for boycotts on French products. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, among others, have condemned any offense or possible offense to Muslims as outside of the realm of free speech. A video from Pakistan surfacing last week depicted a schoolteacher beheading an effigy of Macron in front of children.

“Macron is one of the few leaders who worship Satan,” Ataur Rahman, a senior leader of the Islami Andolan Bangladesh (Islamic Movement) party of Bangladesh, said at one of the several protests against Macron in Dhaka that have taken place.

Khamenei also claimed that the Iranian regime has no preference between President Donald Trump and Democrat Party candidate Joe Biden, although federal law enforcement officials caught Iran trying to interfere in the election by sending fraudulent emails pretending to be the “Proud Boys,” a male interest political group, attempting to embarrass the Trump campaign. A Newsweek analysis citing several unnamed officials concluded that the Iranian regime would prefer a Biden victory.

Khamenei’s underling, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, predicted in remarks last month that Biden or Trump, regardless of who wins, “would have to surrender to the Iranian nation” following their inauguration.

Khamenei made his remarks during a speech to celebrate the birthday of Muhammad, Islam’s holiest figure, which Shiite Muslims celebrate at a different date than Sunnis. Sunni Muslims observed the holiday last week. Iranian news outlets also claimed that Tuesday was the “National Day of Fight Against Global Arrogance.”

“No matter who wins the U.S. elections, it won’t affect our policy toward the US. Some people talk about what will happen if this or that one is elected. Yes, certain events may happen but they don’t concern us. Our policy is calculated and clear,” Khamenei said, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.

“The U.S. regime suffers from severe political, civil, and moral deviations. This is what their own analysts say. Such a regime won’t last long,” Khamenei predicted. “Of course, if certain people hold office, they speed up its destruction, while with others it may take a little longer.”

Khamenei did not name who he believed would be likelier to speed up the destruction of America.

In highlights from the supreme leader’s speech posted on his website, he further insulted America by calling it a “regime of Arrogance” responsible for global terrorism.

“That regime of Arrogance is a collection of harms, mischief and evils. The regime of Arrogance is warmongering, a terrorist and breeds terrorism,” Khamenei said. “It is interfering, corrupt and monopolistic. This means that the Arrogant regime is an embodiment of indecency, evils and mischief. Therefore, confronting such Arrogance and such a phenomenon is synonymous with rationality.”

Khamenei also used his nationally televised time to insult French President Emmanuel Macron and the French nation in general. Islamic leaders globally have condemned Macron for honoring a schoolteacher beheaded by a teen jihadist last month for using cartoons of Muhammad from the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a class on freedom of speech. The heads of state of Turkey, Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan, as well as powerful political leaders in countries like Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, have condemned Macron, who definitively stated in remarks at the teacher, Samuel Paty’s, memorial service, “we will never give up cartoons.”

“Today, the main enemies of Islam are the Arrogant Powers and Zionism. The last manifestation of their enmity was the Paris incident. It is not just about one caricaturist committing a wrongdoing. Arrogant Powers and Zionism support this,” Khamenei said, referring to Israel and its general safeguards for free speech. “The French government relates insulting the Prophet to freedom. … Defending a caricaturist’s viciousness and supporting terrorists are two sides of the same coin.”

The Iranian Islamic regime has been predicting America’s downfall since it took over decades ago. Last month, the Iranian Expediency Council, a religious agency, held an international “webinar” alongside Imam Hossein University to discuss “why the era when the U.S. was the world’s superpower is in the past.” To highlight the point, the event occurred at the former U.S. embassy that Islamist radicals overran violently in 1979.

Iran's Khamenei Taunted Trump Before Soleimani Strike: 'You Can't Do Anything' | Breitbart https://t.co/1ECNRJEgSP — Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) January 3, 2020

Participants in the “webinar” said, according to state-run PressTV, “the U.S. is in decline on multiple fronts, and can no longer paint itself as a moral leader in a globalized world where multilateralism and the fundamental norms of international law prevail.”

The regime scheduled a similar seminar for 2021, suggesting it continues to expect the United States to exist then.

Iran has faced prodigious geopolitical struggles during the Trump era thanks to Trump refusing to abide by the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and the imposition of growing sanctions to punish the regime for its human rights atrocities in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the world. The nuclear deal, brokered while Biden was vice president, resulted in Iran gaining billions in profits from the reduction and elimination of sanctions, as well as a separate $1.7 billion cash payment from the Obama regime. Trump reimposed significant sanctions on the regime, largely on its lucrative oil industry, and has pressured allies around the world to reduce their commerce with the Islamist dictatorship.

The Trump administration has also significantly reduced Iran’s military influence, particularly with the elimination from the battlefield this year of its premier terrorist mind, Major General Qasem Soleimani, the late head of the Quds Force. The Quds Force is the foreign arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the terrorist wing of the Iranian military. The Trump administration also designated the IRGC itself a foreign terrorist organization.

Jewish Israelis’ growing support of President Trump is in part due to the Trump administration’s stronghanded policies in dealing with the Palestinians and Iran, the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the relocation of the U.S. embassy there, as well as the recent epic peace agreements with Gulf and Muslim countries, with more in the foreseeable future.

The peace deals were deemed by senior Palestinian Authority (PA) officials, including President Mahmoud Abbas, as an abandonment of the Palestinian cause, saying it amounted to “a stab in the back” and “treason.”

On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu applauded President Trump’s Mideast policies, telling reporters that the alliance between the two countries “has never been stronger” as he expressed his appreciation for steps taken by the Trump administration and his hopes for continued bipartisan support.

“We will wait and see whether the election will mean a continuation or a disruption of US policy toward Israel,” said Danny Ayalon, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., adding Israel is in a “much better place” as a result of Trump’s policies.

In the meantime, Palestinians see the prospect of a second Trump term as disastrous.

“If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us, God help you and God help the whole world,” Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said last month in a meeting with a group of European parliamentarians.

“There is nobody who could possibly be stupider than he is. He has been the worst American president as far as our cause is concerned. The most important thing as far as we are concerned is that Trump goes,” said Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to PA President Abbas.

Abbas and his deputies are desperate for a Biden electoral victory, believing he will be more supportive of the Palestinian cause as he has come out strongly against Israeli annexation plans, criticized the Trump peace plan, and voiced support for a two-state solution satisfactory to the Palestinian leadership.

Recently, two senior Palestinian officials confirmed that the PA is in direct communication with the election campaign of US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

In addition, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris indicated Saturday in an interview via email with The Arab American News that under a Biden administration, the US will renew its ties with the Palestinians and oppose Israeli unilateral actions that undermine a two-state solution.

Harris added that a Biden administration will take immediate steps to restore economic assistance to the Palestinians, attempt to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and reopen the US consulate in East Jerusalem and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) mission in Washington.

“We will also oppose annexation and settlement expansion,” she noted.

According to a poll published on Tuesday by the Israel Democracy Institute, the majority of Israelis believe President Trump is the better candidate in the U.S. presidential elections in regard to Israel’s national interests.

October’s survey points to an increase in support for the president among Jewish Israelis, reaching 70 percent who favor Trump and up 10 percent from June. Surprisingly, 40 percent of Israeli leftists said that Trump is preferable in terms of Israeli interests.

Many Jewish Israelis believe that Biden’s election would weaken US-Israeli relations, with only seven percent stating they believed it would strengthen.

On Monday, Jewish settler heads held a public prayer event for President Trump’s victory at Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs, revered by all three Abrahamic faiths as the burial place of the biblical patriarchs.

Chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel, Mark Zell, also participated in the event, stating the site was especially appropriate to express gratitude for all that Trump has done for the Jews and Israel during his presidential term.

“We owe a debt of gratitude to President Trump for four good years and for his support of the State of Israel, the land of Israel and the settlement enterprise,” said Yochai Damri, head of the Hebron regional council and the event’s organizer. “The polls are close and we are gathering to pray at the Cave of the Patriarchs for his success.”

“We have come to bless President Trump, both for the past, to thank him, but also for the future, that he succeeds in the coming election,” said Yishai Fleisher, spokesman for the Hebron settlers.

Over the weekend, a motorcade featuring dozens of motorbikes supporting President Trump in Jerusalem’s Old City went viral, marking the fourth Jewish “Trump train” within a week.

The motorcycles, mostly Harley-Davidsons, sported Trump flags in both Hebrew and English, as well as Israeli and American flags.

Last month, Israel’s top rabbis prayed for President Trump to recover from COVID-19, invoking his name in a Jewish holiday ceremony at Jerusalem’s Western Wall.

“May He who blessed our forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David and Solomon send healing to Donald John, son of Fred,” intoned Shmuel Rabinovitch, rabbi of the Western Wall, Judaism’s holiest prayer site, to the amens of Israel’s two chief rabbis.

On the Palestinian side, things have been quite different.

The PA has cut off all contact with the Trump administration and has refused to cooperate with Trump’s Deal of the Century peace plan. Furthermore, Trump halted millions of dollars of financial aid and closed the PLO office in Washington.

“We are sure that if Biden wins, he will reassert the U.S. position on the two-state solution and order the PLO office in Washington reopened,” said one PA official.

The support for President Trump in Israel may have significant and practical ramifications.

As many as 300,000 American-Israelis are eligible to vote in the election according to some estimates, and many are registered in key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Florida.

With elections here, the long-awaited outcome will decide not only the future direction of the U.S. but that of the world and the Middle East in specific.

With a Biden administration soft on Iran and the Palestinians and with little hope in its ability to achieve historic peace agreements similar to the ones the Trump administration has, a reversal of current U.S. policies would likely bring back the failed ones of the Obama administration along with its consequences.

Biden said in his speech: “I sought this office to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of the nation — the middle class. To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home.”

Meanwhile, China earlier Saturday mocked President Trump — who many argue has been the toughest U.S. president on China in their lifetime.

The official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the People’s Daily China, retweeted the president’s tweet that said, “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!” and added a laughing emoji with the comment “HaHa,” according to the Washington Post.

The official Chinese paper later deleted the tweet.

According to Vice, Chinese citizens rejoiced in the prospect of a Trump defeat. One wrote on the popular microblogging site Weibo: “You’re fired. … I’m glad that Americans are finally showing some intelligence and exercising their so-called superior sense of democracy.” Vice also reported:

Biden’s name shot to the top of trending charts and forums on the state-censored microblogging site, with millions of Weibo netizens praising the ‘well-deserved victory’. ‘Woo hoo, a great day for the world and an even better event for China,’ said one user, reflecting a broader mood a change from Trump, whose administration engaged in costly, drawn-out trade wars with Beijing that stoked tensions between the two world powers.

Asia expert Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer and former U.S. diplomat, wrote in a November 6, 2020, Asia Times article, predicting a softer stance towards China under a Biden presidency:

Although one hears that ‘getting tough with China’ is now a bipartisan theme, I’ve not seen a shred of evidence to suggest that the term means the same thing in Biden circles as it does in Trump circles.

“We may know soon enough,” Newsham, a senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies and the Center for Security Policy, added.

One of the priests arrested was Father Lu Genjun, the former vicar general of the Baoding diocese, reported AsiaNews, the official press agency of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions. The bishop of Baoding, Giacomo Su Zhimin, was abducted by police in 1997 and nothing has been known about his whereabouts since then.

One priest of the underground community of Baoding noted that crackdowns against the underground church have intensified following the renewal of the provisional agreement between China and the Vatican on the naming of bishops, AsiaNews reported.

The diocese of Baoding, with over 500,000 Catholic faithful, is one of the cornerstones of the underground Catholic community.

This week’s arrests in Baoding coincide with reports of the eviction of eight Catholic nuns from their convent in the northern province of Shanxi for their refusal to join the state-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

Amid ongoing harassment, surveillance, and intimidation from local authorities, the nuns finally opted to abandon their convent after authorities ordered the removal of the cross and a dozen religious statues from the building and grounds, Bitter Winter reported earlier this week.

“The cross is a symbol of salvation. Removing it felt like cutting our own flesh,” one of the nuns said. “Had we refused to take it away, the government would have demolished the convent.”

“Officials declared us ‘dangerous persons’ and repeatedly harassed us,” the sister said. “They asked us to write down what we had done since kindergartens [sic] and demanded to disclose everything we did over the past few months. They even wanted us to remember the license plates of the vehicles we used during our trips.”

As part of their surveillance of the nuns, local authorities had installed four surveillance cameras in the convent to monitor the sisters and their visitors.

“Three persons, a police officer and two local officials, were assigned to keep watch over us,” the nun said. “They often went inside the convent to inquire about our activities, sometimes at night. The government even hired some thugs and ruffians to harass us. They would get into the kitchen while we cooked to mess around or act lasciviously, inviting us to have dinner with them.”

Many members of the underground Catholic Church in China, which is faithful to Rome, have resisted joining the Patriotic Association for fear of being “completely controlled by the CCP, cut off from God,” one Chinese Catholic told Bitter Winter.

China’s Catholic Church has been split into underground and open communities since 1958, with the latter going by the title of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. A Vatican document of 1988 barred Roman Catholics from participating in the sacraments of the Patriotic Church, noting that the patriotic association had broken off all relationships with the pope and would be under the direct control of the communist government.

Pope Benedict XVI reached out to Catholics in China with an open letter, in which he praised their faithfulness, encouraged their perseverance, and laid out new guidelines for the life of the Church in China.

In a report commissioned by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in the Netherlands (IUCN NL), 75 intelligence sources, including traffickers of illegal goods, said that criminals sometimes bribe high-ranking government security officials to successfully operate Bolivia’s illegal jaguar trade on established transport routes.

The jaguar is South America’s largest feline. It is classified as “near-threatened” by the IUCN, which estimates that just 2,000-3,000 wild jaguars remain in Bolivia. Traffickers target the endangered cats to sell their teeth, bones, and genitals to Asian clients, the majority of whom are Chinese. The jaguar parts are often passed off as tiger parts, traditionally desired in Asia for their supposed medicinal properties. Increased poaching of tigers in Asia in recent years has decimated the continent’s tiger population, forcing traders to turn to jaguars as a cheaper alternative.

Earth League International (ELI) conducted intelligence-gathering for the IUCN report using “techniques like those employed by government spy agencies to track wildlife crime,” according to Reuters.

“[Bolivia’s] jaguar trade is run by Chinese South American residents, who mostly supply to sellers in China or have links with wholesalers and stockers in China,” ELI’s investigations found.

The “Putian Gang,” or the South American branch of the Chinese Fujian Mafia, plays a major role in controlling the trade of jaguars to China, according to ELI. One of ELI’s sources on the illegal jaguar trade in Bolivia, identified only as “Pol 8B” in the report, said that the Putian Gang “has underground casinos, runs money laundering activities, and runs the cocaine business in Bolivia.”

China has established an increased presence in Bolivia in recent years through its infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative.

“Infrastructural developments and the influx of Chinese companies in recent years have been indirect drivers for the surge in jaguar trafficking in Bolivia, both through opening up previously inaccessible wilderness territory and providing new sources of consumer demand,” IUCN stated in its report.

This finding is supported by a 2018 on-site report by Bolivian newspaper El Deber and environmental website Mongabay Latam. According to their joint report, “Residents say that an influx of Chinese companies which are building roads and bridges in Bolivia is contributing to the increased trafficking in jaguar parts.”

“In 2015, in an attempt to improve the investment climate, former [Bolivian] President Evo Morales expanded efforts to attract international investment and boost Bolivia’s energy production capacity,” IUCN recalled in its report. “This move was welcomed by China. Chinese companies have significantly increased their presence in Bolivia in recent years, particularly active in the energy and and transport infrastructure and mining sectors.”

“China is the largest exporter to Bolivia, accounting for around 18 percent of the country’s total imports. It is also the fifth-largest destination for Bolivian exports, mostly raw materials and minerals,” the IUCN noted, citing data from the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade."

He did not confirm Kim would receive an invite, nor did he rule it out.

Speaking with lawmakers at the Upper House budget committee on Thursday, Suga fielded a question on whether Kim Jong-un should receive an invitation to the Olympics. Suga responded that Tokyo could take advantage of the event to hold further diplomatic talks, which have stalled after the regime refused to take concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear program.

Lawmakers also reportedly asked Suga if Japan could hold talks with the leaders of the United States, China, South Korea, and Russia, which he described as a “very important opportunity for diplomacy.” He hinted that it may not be within his power to invite Kim to the Olympic Games, as it is up to the International and Japanese Olympic Committees as well as the city of Tokyo to decide on who is invited.

The 71-year-old elder statesman of the Liberal Democratic Party, who took over from Abe Shinzo in September following his resignation due to poor health, has prioritized improving relations with Pyongyang and securing the release of the dozens of Japanese citizens abducted by the North Korean regime since it was established over half a century ago.

Plans for the Tokyo Olympics remain marred by uncertainty after the Chinese coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to postpone it. They are currently scheduled to take place next year, although it remains unclear if stadiums will be allowed to reach full capacity or if some events will be canceled.

North Korean athletes have always competed at the Olympic Games, finding particular success in gymnastics and weightlifting. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the country’s Olympic team secured seven medals — two gold, three silver, two bronze — in events including weightlifting, gymnastics, shooting, and table tennis.

At the height of peace negotiations in 2018, North and South Korean officials announced that the two countries would compete as a joint Olympic team, the first time they have done so since the Korean War broke out in 1950.

Should Kim ultimately attend the Tokyo Olympics, he would be following in the footsteps of his sister Kim Yo-jong, who attended the Pyeongchang, South Korea, Winter Olympics at the beginning of 2018. Despite the fact she reportedly plays a large role in human rights atrocities committed in her home country, left-wing media in the United States offered her favorable coverage. CNN declared at the time that she had “[stolen] the show” from her diplomatic counterparts."
678,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/06/japan-shuts-down-all-but-one-nuclear-reactor-for-anti-terror-protections/,Japan Shuts Down All but One Nuclear Reactor for Anti-Terror Protections,"Japan announced on Wednesday it has shut down all but one of its nine nuclear reactors for at least the next six weeks to comply with safety regulations requiring anti-terror protections for all of its nuclear facilities.

“Kansai Electric Power Co. shut down the No. 4 reactor at its Oi nuclear plant in Fukui Prefecture, western Japan, for regular maintenance on November 3,” the Asahi Shimbun reported on Wednesday, adding that this means Japan will now “have to limp by on just one nuclear reactor for the next six weeks.”

The shutdown has left the “No. 4 reactor of Kyushu Electric Power Co.’s Genkai nuclear power plant in Genkai, Saga Prefecture” as the only nuclear reactor currently operating in Japan. The Genkai plant usually operates two reactors, but its No. 3 reactor is currently undergoing routine inspections.

“Electric power companies are required to construct an anti-terrorism facility at their nuclear power plants under stringent new safety regulations imposed after the triple meltdown at the Fukushima plant [in 2011],” the newspaper noted.

Kansai Electric failed to meet the deadline for building anti-terror protections at its Takahama nuclear power plant in Takahama, Fukui Prefecture, “forcing it to take its No. 3 and No. 4 reactors offline.”

According to the report, “Kyushu Electric’s Sendai nuclear power plant’s No. 1 and No. 2 reactors in Satsuma-Sendai, Kagoshima Prefecture, were also suspended after construction of an anti-terrorism facility fell behind schedule.”

Kansai Electric plans to finish construction of an anti-terror facility at its Takahama nuclear power plant by December 22, at which time it says it will restart the No. 3 reactor.

Japan ordered all of its nuclear power plants to shut down following the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture, triggered by an earthquake and tsunami disaster in the surrounding area. The nation has slowly allowed a handful of nuclear power plants to reopen since then. The Kansai, Shikoku, and Kyushu electric power utility companies have restarted operations of nine reactors in five nuclear power plants across Japan.

“This is the first time since May 2017 that all nuclear reactors operated by Kansai Electric remain suspended,” the Asahi Shimbun noted on Wednesday.

Water used to cool molten nuclear fuel at the Fukushima nuclear power plant during the 2011 meltdown has been stored in tanks on the facility’s premises since then. Japanese media reported in mid-October that Tokyo was moving forward with plans to release the contaminated water at Fukushima’s power plant into the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese government reportedly made the decision after running out of above-ground storage containers for the contaminated water and failing to agree on alternative options for its disposal."

At a regularly scheduled press conference on November 9, the U.S. cable news outlet CNN asked Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin why China had yet to offer an official congratulatory message to Biden after “most American media” declared his victory in the election.

“[L]eaders of many countries have sent congratulatory messages to him. Why has China been dilatory in making statements? Is it because you think the outcome of the US presidential election is still uncertain, or do you have other considerations? When will China send a congratulatory message?” CNN asked Wenbin.

“On your first question, we noticed that Mr. Biden has declared election victory. We understand the presidential election result will be determined following the U.S. laws and procedures,” Wenbin responded.

“On your second question, we will follow international customary practices,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman continued.

“We always believe China and the United States should strengthen communication and dialogue, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation based on mutual benefit, and promote the sound and stable development of China-U.S. relations,” he said.

“We hope the new U.S. government can meet China halfway,” Wengbin added, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

China remains among a handful of major nations, including Russia and Mexico, that have so far chosen not to offer official messages of congratulation to Biden.

Initial results from the U.S. presidential election on November 3 showed U.S. President Donald Trump held a lead over his challenger, Biden. Trump lead in key states as polls closed on election night. By the morning of November 4, however, Trump’s lead had diminished due to mounting mail-in ballots favoring Biden, observers said. Several U.S. states expanded mail-in voting for the presidential election this year in response to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Since November 4, Republicans have protested the election results in some states, claiming that legally authorized poll watchers have allegedly been prevented from observing the ballot counting process at designated centers. The Trump administration claimed it has received reports of voter fraud in multiple states.

Trump’s legal team has filed lawsuits in some states to halt the ballot counting process after Election Day and to demand a recount of the vote; the president’s lawyers are currently organizing an official legal challenge to the alleged voter fraud. Trump vowed in a speech at the White House on November 5 that his legal team would pursue the challenge all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.

“This election is not over,” Trump 2020 Campaign General Counsel Matt Morgan said in a statement on November 6."

Russian security officials located and detained the suspect – identified as private Anton Makarov, 20 – following a massive manhunt in the vicinity of the Baltimore military airfield near Voronezh, located about 310 miles south of Moscow.

“[O]n November 9, 2020 at 5:30 a.m. Makarov, in order to take possession of a service weapon, using an ax, killed an officer, after which he shot his colleagues, two of whom were killed, one was wounded,” Russia’s federal Investigative Committee said in a statement Monday.

An anonymous source told Russia’s Interfax news agency that the shooting incident was sparked by an altercation between Makarov and an officer during a morning inspection at the military base.

“The soldier ‘grabbed a handgun’ from the officer’s holster and fired,” Interfax reported.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) quoted unnamed sources as saying that Makarov “argued with a major, snatched the officer’s handgun, and shot him. Makarov then fired at a corporal and a private who rushed to assist the major.”

Russia’s Western Military District denied that such an altercation between Makarov and an officer took place prior to the shooting, according to the Moscow Times. Investigators from Russia’s Investigative Committee have launched an official probe into the incident and are currently interrogating Makarov, according to the newspaper.

“Doctors at a military hospital in Voronezh said a soldier who sustained injuries in the shooting was being treated at the medical facility,” Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported.

Over 100 members of Russia’s national guard, Rosgvardia, participated in the manhunt to locate Makarov, which also included the use of helicopters and drones.

Monday’s shooting at the Voronezh airfield was the second such incident at a Russian military base in just over a year. Human rights activists say that Russian army conscripts are often subjected to brutal hazing rituals by fellow servicemen.

At a military base in Siberia in October 2019, a Russian private shot eight fellow soldiers dead and wounded two others. “Investigations revealed that the incident was triggered by bullying,” according to RFE/RL.

The man convicted in the shooting “said earlier this year that he had been left with no other course of action after conscripts turned his life into a living ‘hell’,” according to Reuters.

Russian men between the ages of 18-27 are legally required to serve one year in the army under state law."

The meerkat reportedly chose Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.

A video circulating on social media, first reported by Coconuts, shows a meerkat at the Songkhla provincial zoo in southern Thailand tasked with breaking the deadlock three days after the election was held.

Surfacing from his meerkat aperture, the creature observed pictures of both candidates hanging on a wireline before retreating back into its hole, presumably to make a decision.

After pondering the two options, the meerkat re-emerged directly and placed its paw on the photo of Joe Biden.

It is not the first time that the Songkhla zoo’s meerkats have grabbed international headlines. In May last year, two of the zoo’s meerkat population gave birth to four new meerkats, taking the total number to 13.

“Meerkats are a member of the mongoose family of animals and are native to southern Africa, where they live in large groups in burrows in savanna and dry grasslands,” noted Channel News Asia at the time. “The babies have drawn in lots of visitors to see them with their pack in a specially built enclosure that helps the animals adjust to the steamy tropical conditions of Thailand.”

“A total of 55,725 people have been tested so far near the factory, accounting for 97.5 percent of the total residents in Yanchang Road sub-district, the worst impacted area, and 6,620 have been confirmed infected,” the Chinese state-run Global Times reported on Thursday.

The new figure more than doubles the number of cases Lanzhou health authorities said they had documented as of September 14 in connection with the same outbreak. At the time, government health officials said they had recorded just 3,245 positive brucellosis cases in the same district.

Brucellosis is a highly infectious bacterial disease commonly found among livestock such as goats, sheep, and pigs. Humans typically contract the disease via close contact with infected animal tissue, or by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. Brucellosis symptoms include recurring fever, fatigue, and joint pain. Though rarely deadly, the disease may cause chronic health problems and damage reproductive health.

Lanzhou health authorities announced late last year that the state-run Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant “used expired sanitizers while producing Brucella vaccines between July 24 and August 20 [2019].”

“This resulted in the bacteria entering the factory’s exhaust and infecting people nearby,” officials said, according to Caixin Global.

“There are more than ten communities with a combined population of more than 10,000 located within one kilometer of the plant,” the Beijing-based news site noted.

The Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant is a unit of the state-run China Animal Husbandry Industry. According to the state health commission assigned to investigate the incident, the plant’s contaminated waste gas formed aerosols that were carried downwind to the nearby Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, where the outbreak was first recorded in November 2019.

“Eight people responsible for the incident in the pharmaceutical factory were fired or warned,” an official of the Lanzhou Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said at a press conference on Wednesday, according to the Global Times.

Chinese state authorities shut down the Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant in December 2019 and dismantled it in October 2020.

“The local government will urge the company to further speed up the relocation of the plant out of the city, to eliminate the source of hidden dangers,” Lanzhou deputy mayor Wei Qingxiang said at Wednesday’s press conference. Wei referred to the state-owned China Animal Husbandry Industry, which runs the pharmaceutical plant.

The brucellosis outbreak in Lanzhou is the latest vaccine corruption scandal to hit China in recent years. Despite repeated failures to safely produce and administer standard vaccines to its citizens, the Chinese Communist Party insists that it will soon release an experimental Chinese coronavirus vaccine."
683,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/06/u-s-drops-uyghur-group-from-terrorist-list-angering-china/,"U.S. Drops Uyghur Group from Terrorist List, Angering China","The U.S. State Department announced on Thursday that a group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) will be delisted as a terrorist organization.

The Chinese government reacted angrily to the announcement, as ETIM’s activities were the pretext for China’s abuse of the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang province and the creation of Xinjiang’s vast network of re-education camps.

A State Department official told Radio Free Asia (RFA) in an email on Thursday that ETIM was removed from the list because “for more than a decade, there has been no credible evidence that ETIM continues to exist.”

ETIM is (or was) a militant Uyghur separatist group that apparently formed in the late 1990s and was first listed by the United States as a terrorist organization in 2002. Its founder Hasan Mahsum, allegedly trained at terrorist camps in Afghanistan in the 1990s, was charged by China with a spree of robberies and murders in 1999.

Mahsum was killed by Pakistani military forces in 2003, and a similar fate befell his successor Abdul Haq in 2010, at which time Pakistani and Chinese officials claimed to have “broken the back” of ETIM and its “syndicate” of allied militant groups in the mountainous region between China and Pakistan.

ETIM was dedicated to creating an independent “East Turkestan” within China’s borders. East Turkestan is the name used by many of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs to refer to their ancestral homeland. According to the United Nations, ETIM received support from the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and a similar militant separatist group called the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

The U.N. estimated that ETIM was never very large — about 200 active operatives at its peak — but it had widespread operations, including training camps beyond China’s borders. The Chinese police reported confiscating large inventories of guns, grenades, and explosive materials from captured members.

“Among the violent acts committed by ETIM members were the blowing up of the warehouse of the Urumqi Train Station on 23 May 1998, the armed looting of 247,000 RMB Yuan in Urumqi on 4 February 1999, an explosion in Hetian City, Xinjiang, on 25 March 1999 and violent resistance against arrest in Xinhe County, Xinjiang, on 18 June 1999. These incidents resulted in the deaths of 140 people and injuries to 371,” the U.N. Security Council said in 2011.

The Chinese government insists the group remains a large, active, and dangerous threat with widespread support in Xinjiang. This was the excuse for the crackdown against Uyghurs that led to the infamous Xinjiang concentration camps.

China tends to dismiss Uyghur activists living abroad as ETIM members. It also accuses ETIM of working closely with another group called the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP) and sometimes claims the two groups are one and the same, an assertion doubted by outside observers.

“Some Western security officials and experts are skeptical about the cohesiveness and capabilities of ETIM and TIP, and say most Xinjiang-related unrest is caused by disparate and poorly organized groups of local residents angered by Chinese policies,” the Wall Street Journal observed when China launched a high-profile manhunt for suspected ETIM members in 2014.

“In 2009, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. government had failed to present sufficient evidence that ETIM was linked to either Al Qaeda or the Taliban, and while the group remained on the Treasury Department’s terror list, there is little to suggest that it had made significant inroads in China, nor that what limited amount of Uyghur radicalization exists in the country presented a significant security risk,” RFA noted.

RFA quoted applause for the State Department’s delisting of ETIM, including approval from World Uyghur Congress president Dolkun Isa, who said the announcement carried “historic significance.”

“Currently China justifies its mass detention of 1 to 3 million Uyghurs in concentration camps as a counter-terror measure. Today’s revocation removes any Chinese justification that it is fighting terrorism in East Turkestan. Today’s revocation also proves that the Uyghur cause is peaceful and has nothing to do with terrorism as the Chinese government claims,” Isa said.

Sean Roberts of George Washington University’s International Development Studies Program thought the delisting was long overdue, since “most of the damage” to the Uyghurs has already been done, but said it was still important for the U.S. to “correct past wrongs.”

“As far as I’m concerned, there was no group ever called the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement and the people who were associated with that label have long stopped existing as any kind of group whatsoever,” he said.

“The damage of this designation is done. ETIM as a terrorist organization and specter has already become entrenched in Chinese thinking,” lamented Nottingham University senior research fellow Rian Thum, while similarly praising the Trump administration for doing what it can to secure better treatment for the Uyghurs.

The Chinese government was infuriated by the State Department announcement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accused the U.S. of having “an ugly two-faced approach toward terrorist organizations.”

“Terrorism is terrorism. The U.S. should immediately correct its mistake and refrain from ‘whitewashing’ terrorist organizations, or going backwards in international cooperation on counter-terrorism,” Wang said at a press conference on Friday.

Wang insisted ETIM remains a threat to Chinese national security, noting it remains listed as a terrorist organization by the U.N. Security Council. He said the group has been “engaged in terrorist and violent activities for a long time, causing a large number of casualties and property losses, seriously threatening the security and stability of China as well as the international community.”"

The Global Times quoted Renmin University of China associate dean Jin Canrong taking Vice President Mike Pence’s absence from Trump’s latest press conference as evidence “the Republicans are keeping a distance from Trump, and may even be abandoning him.”

“Without support from the Republicans, Trump’s legal challenges in multiple battleground states are unlikely to receive enough political, logistical and financial resources,” Jin predicted.

Other Chinese commentators said Trump’s supporters in battleground states “seem to have become more irrational – making online threats, ramping up demonstrations, spreading unverified information of election ‘fraud and corruption,’ or staging protests at vote counting venues.”

The Chinese Communist paper noted Big Tech censorship of Trump-supporting groups, and not exactly in a disapproving manner:

Shen Yi, an expert on US politics and international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Thursday that both sides are trying to use social media networks to organize to impact the vote counting process, but nationwide chaos is unlikely. “Some radical Trump supporters are playing old tricks such as spreading disinformation and launching sectarian and anti-intellectualism propaganda. But it seems social media platforms and US mainstream media are containing their voices,” Shen said. US media reported that many Trump supporters have become the hub of disinformation and hatred, sowing conspiracy theories and falsely claiming that the ballot count was being rigged, and called for demonstrations.

The Global Times’ analysts relished the “significant and unprecedented chance for Chinese people and scholars to research on and observe the problems of modern U.S. democracy.” It also relished the possibility that China’s determined adversary for the past four years might cause himself some trouble by refusing to accept the election results:

Some observers said Trump’s grassroots radical supporters are still cooperating with Trump to pressure the vote counting process and the media, so Trump might want to use them to create more civil unrest and riots, and to force the Democrats not to hunt him down on alleged tax fraud and other issues after he leaves the White House. “This would be very dangerous for Trump and his family, because if Trump uses his supporters to bring further damage to US society, he should be held accountable, and the Democrats and the Biden administration won’t let him just go away easily,” Jin noted.

Jin concluded such a tumultuous finale for the 2020 election was unlikely because the incoming administration could “anger Trump supporters and cause nationwide unrest” by arresting Trump."

“Various articles introducing Biden’s life have become popular on the internet in China. The tragedy of him losing close family members has aroused sympathy among Chinese people. His failed bids for presidency in the past have also helped create an image of a tenacious man,” Hu wrote on Friday.

The official position of the Chinese government, and the official tenor of the conversation on its heavily-censored, government-approved social media sites, has long been that China has little preference in the U.S. presidential race and expected no major changes to U.S.-China relations if Biden won the election. If anything, Chinese social media accounts worked overtime during the last days of the U.S. election to convey the sense that they don’t support Biden and have no great expectations of him.

Chinese “netizens” were said to be curious about President Donald Trump, appreciative of his pragmatic outsider approach to politics, and disdainful of his opponent Hillary Clinton when Trump won the presidency in 2016. Their attitude toward Trump soured considerably after the U.S.-China trade war began, and especially after Trump highlighted China’s actions in spreading the Wuhan coronavirus.

The Chinese yuan, which dropped precipitously on Tuesday night when it appeared Trump would win re-election, soared to a 28-month high as post-election counting delivered victory to Biden."
686,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/06/australia-charges-chinese-community-leader-foreign-interference/,Australia Charges Chinese Community Leader with ‘Foreign Interference’,"The Australian Federal Police (AFP) on Thursday charged Melbourne resident and local Chinese community leader Duong Di Sanh with preparing to carry out a “foreign interference offense,” which carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison.

Duong, 65, leads two major Chinese cultural organizations in Australia and is the first person to be charged under Australia’s foreign interference laws, which Canberra passed in 2018 amid increasing tension with Beijing. The legislation criminalizes “covert, deceptive, or threatening actions that are intended to interfere with democratic processes or provide intelligence to overseas governments.”

After being charged on Thursday in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, Duong was released on bail to appear in court again in March 2021. Police said Duong’s charges followed a year-long investigation by Australia’s Counter Foreign Interference (CFI) Taskforce, led by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), the nation’s domestic spy agency, and the AFP.

“The CFI Taskforce has taken preventative action to disrupt this individual at an early stage,” AFP Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney said on Thursday.

“Foreign interference is contrary to Australia’s national interest, it goes to the heart of our democracy,” he said.

“It is corrupting and deceptive, and goes beyond routine diplomatic influence practiced by governments,” McCartney added.

Duong serves as deputy chairman of the Museum of Chinese Australian History in Melbourne. He is also president of the Oceania Federation of Chinese Organizations, a group representing ethnic Chinese people from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. He was a candidate for Australia’s center-right Liberal Party in a 1996 Victoria state election.

“Mr. Duong has been linked with the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification — which is affiliated with the Chinese Government’s overseas influence arm, the United Front Work Department,” the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) noted Thursday.

Duong’s foreign interference charge comes amid growing diplomatic and trade tension between Canberra and Beijing. This week, China ordered its traders to halt imports of several categories of Australian products, including copper ore and concentrate, coal, timber, barley, sugar, wine, and lobsters.

Bloomberg asked Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin about China’s increased trade restrictions on Australian products at a regular press conference in Beijing on Thursday.

Wang said in response:

The Chinese competent authorities’ measures on foreign imports are in line with Chinese laws and regulations and international customary practices. They protect the safety of consumers and the legitimate rights and interests of domestic industries, and are consistent with the free trade agreement between China and Australia

“We hope Australia can do more to enhance mutual trust and bilateral cooperation, as the China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership calls for, and bring the bilateral relations back to the right track as early as possible,” he added."
687,2020-11-06 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/06/pro-modi-indian-news-anchor-arnab-goswami-arrested-after-alleged-mention-in-suicide-note/,Pro-Modi Indian News Anchor Arrested After Alleged Mention in Suicide Note,"Mumbai police arrested right-wing Indian news anchor Arnab Goswami – a vocal supporter of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – on Wednesday in relation to a two-year-old case of abetment to suicide.

His arrest in India’s Maharashtra state, ruled by the BJP-rival Shiv Sena party, immediately drew criticism from the BJP, whose leaders condemned the act as part of a political vendetta against Goswami and his recent criticism of Shiv Sena leaders.

Goswami was arrested at his residence in Mumbai on Wednesday morning in connection with the recently reopened suicide case of interior designer Anvay Naik. In a 2018 suicide note, Naik allegedly named Goswami as having refused to pay him for work he had done for Goswami’s television network, Republic TV. The network released a statement in 2018 denying the allegations as unfounded.

“Police had closed the case last year, but on the directions of [Maharashtra] state home minister Anil Deshmukh, they moved the court earlier this year and got it reopened. Police said Naik’s daughter Adnya had met the minister in May this year,” the Times of India noted on Wednesday.

Goswami is known for his support of Prime Minister Modi and his ruling BJP, a Hindu nationalist party. He hosts a daily news show on Republic TV, an Indian TV channel he founded, and frequently invites on BJP opponents and critics of the government to discuss politics. On his show, Goswami recently accused India’s Maharashtra state government of involvement in the June 14 death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Police have said Rajput’s death in Mumbai, located in Maharashtra state, appeared to be a suicide. However, Goswami and his network insinuated that Rajput’s death may have been a murder in which the Maharashtra government, ruled by the BJP-rival Shiv Sena party, was possibly involved.

Several leading members of the national ruling party denounced Goswami’s arrest on Wednesday as an act of “revenge” by Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena party against the BJP for the journalist’s recent allegations.

Indian Interior Minister Amit Shah, a long-time ally of Prime Minister Modi, wrote on Twitter: “This attack on free press must be and WILL BE OPPOSED.”

Congress and its allies have shamed democracy once again. Blatant misuse of state power against Republic TV & Arnab Goswami is an attack on individual freedom and the 4th pillar of democracy. It reminds us of the Emergency. This attack on free press must be and WILL BE OPPOSED. — Amit Shah (@AmitShah) November 4, 2020

India’s Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar echoed Shah’s sentiments, condemning the arrest on Twitter as an “attack on press freedom.”

Indian Railways Minister Piyush Goyal declared Goswami’s arrest a “fascist move” and “a sign of an undeclared emergency.”

Republic TV claimed Goswami was physically assaulted by Mumbai police during his arrest. The network aired video footage of him being physically forced out of his home and into a police van by police officers.

“Later on Wednesday, Goswami filed a ‘habeas corpus’ petition in the Bombay [Mumbai] high court challenging what he termed as his ‘illegal arrest’ and said a closed case had been reopened only to falsely implicate him,” the Times of India reported."
688,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/05/syrian-mercenary-fighting-armenians-we-were-told-to-slaughter-all-civilians/,Syrian Mercenary Says Orders in Azerbaijan to 'Slaughter All Civilians',"A Syrian mercenary recently captured while fighting for Azerbaijan against Armenia in its ongoing war over Nagorno-Karabakh said on Wednesday that his recruiters instructed him and fellow mercenaries to “slaughter all civilians and soldiers” of an Armenian village they attempted to capture.

Armenian forces captured Syrian national Yusuf Alaabet al-Hajji in recent days and “is currently remanded into custody facing international terrorism charges, among others,” Armenian state news agency Armenpress reported on Wednesday.

Hajji told Armenian investigators that Turkish forces recruited him in Syria to fight for Azerbaijan for “a 2000-dollar monthly payment.” In his testimony, Hajji detailed how Turkish forces transported him and hundreds of other Syrian mercenaries from Syria into Turkey, then on to Azerbaijan.

Shortly after arriving by plane in Azerbaijan on October 18, Hajji said he and his fellow fighters were prepared for battle at an Azeri military base by Turkish and Azeri military personnel.

“We were escorted by Sheikh Ibrahim [Turkish-backed Syrian recruiter] and two Azerbaijani servicemen. Sheikh Ibrahim told us that we must capture the Armenian village ahead of us, and we must slaughter all civilians and soldiers there,” Hajji testified.

“When we approached the Armenian village, we came under fire, and also mortar fire, in this period 15 of us were killed, the operation was a failure and we had to escape into the mountains,” he explained.

“When we fled … we were lost, we went by a path until we found the Azerbaijanis who had accompanied us, they took us through some path, but during this the Armenians began shooting at us. I got wounded, I was wounded for five days, no one asked me anything, no one was interested in me,” Hajji detailed.

“After three days, I began moving towards the Armenian positions, the Armenians gestured me from distance telling me I am safe, when I approached them they took me to their position, treated my wounds, gave me food and water. They took me to safety, they didn’t harm me, they helped and treated me well, may God bless them,” the Syrian mercenary said.

“The Azerbaijanis call the Armenians infidels, but they themselves are the infidels, we [Syrians] are infidels for coming here and fighting against these good people. I stayed wounded for five days in Azerbaijan and no one helped me, but the Armenians did, they helped me and treated my wounds,” Hajji reiterated.

Clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh began on September 27. They have continued since then despite two attempts by Russia and one by the U.S. over the past month to mediate a ceasefire. Nagorno-Karabakh legally belongs to Azerbaijan but is ruled by ethnic Armenian separatists, and sporadic skirmishes between the two sides over the breakaway territory occur regularly. However, the most recent fighting over the region has already surpassed any previous conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh in terms of casualties since a 1991-1994 war that killed 30,000 people.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed support for Baku immediately after fighting broke out on September 27.

“The Turkish people will support our Azerbaijani brothers with all our means as always,” Erdoğan wrote on Twitter.

Turkey views Azerbaijan, with its ethnically Turkic and majority Muslim population, as a sibling state. Russia maintains a strategic military alliance with Christian Armenia and continues to support a ceasefire to end the conflict.

Public Radio of Armenia published video footage on October 8 allegedly showing an imam (Islamic leader) in Syria recruiting mercenary fighters to fight for Azerbaijan against Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh. The video was reportedly shot in the northern Syrian city of Afrin, less than 20 miles from the country’s border with Turkey.

In addition to Armenia, other countries including Syria and France, and the U.K. newspaper the Guardian, have also accused Ankara of sending Syrian mercenaries to Azerbaijan to help bolster its ground forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

French President Emmanuel Macron on October 2 cited intelligence reports that allegedly reveal that “300 Syrian fighters drawn from ‘jihadist groups’ from the Syrian city of Aleppo had passed through the Turkish city of Gaziantep en route for Azerbaijan.”

The city of Afrin, where Public Radio of Armenia’s alleged recruiting video was reportedly shot, is located halfway between Aleppo and the Turkish border.

“These fighters are known, tracked, and identified,” the French president claimed. Macron promised on October 2 to call Erdoğan “in the coming days” to confront him over the crossing of a “red line.” The French leader said he urged “all NATO partners to face up to the behavior of a NATO member.”"

The South American nations pledged “to prevent, discourage and jointly confront” illegal fishing in their exclusive economic zones in the Pacific, explaining that they would boost “cooperation and real-time exchange of information” to highlight the issue.

The announcement comes several months after Ecuador complained to Chinese authorities about illegal fishing after Ecuador identified hundreds of Chinese vessels near the Galápagos Islands, which are part of the country’s exclusive economic zone and an ecologically sensitive area.

According to Ecuadorian officials in July, there were at least 260 ships within the island’s vicinity, all of which disabled their public tracking devices to avoid detection.

“We are on alert, (conducting) surveillance, patrolling to avoid an incident such as what happened in 2017,” Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin said at the time.

In response to the complaint, the Chinese regime officially banned all its vessels from fishing near the Galápagos from September until the end of November. The new rules have reportedly prompted the Chinese ships to target other areas of the South American coast in the exclusive economic zones of Peru and Chile. Waters off the Colombian coast are also a potential target.

In the 2017 incident referenced by Jarrin, authorities arrested and prosecuted a team of Chinese fishermen illegally holding 6,600 sharks they had caught off the Galápagos, causing a diplomatic spat between the two countries. A court found them guilty and sentenced them to between one and four years in jail as well as a $5.9 million fine.

That was not the last time that Chinese vessels were caught violating international law around the Galápagos Islands, famously studied by Charles Darwin as he came up with his theory of evolution. Last year, a fleet of around 250 ships were similarly caught harvesting large numbers of exotic fish from the Galápagos Conservation Zone, a highly sensitive ecological area.

690,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/05/chinese-media-defends-trump-voters-not-just-rednecks-racists/,Chinese Media Defends Trump Voters: ‘Not Just Rednecks and Racists’,"China’s state-run Global Times examined the incredibly close U.S. presidential election on Wednesday and concluded American media analysts were clearly wrong about the nature of the electorate, particularly supporters of the Republican Party and President Donald Trump.

As one Chinese academic put it, “Trump’s base is bigger and more solid than many people’s expectations.”

The Global Times thought one big reason pre-election polls were so far wrong in predicting an easy victory for challenger Joe Biden was that many voters put a higher priority on economic recovery than the coronavirus pandemic.

“Chinese analysts said many Americans are individualists and they have railed against pandemic restrictions as well as refusing to buy what scientists say, so the failed handling of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], a key weakness of Trump, has not affected the decision of many voters,” the article postulated, recalling how strong Trump’s approval rating on the economy was before the pandemic struck.

Those Chinese analysts also thought U.S. media underestimated voter blowback against the summer’s riots. One observer proposed that Trump’s vote share among women, young people, and minorities increased to such a surprising degree because so many of them were harmed by the riots, or angry at the presumption they approved of violence and looting.

Others chided the American polling industry for bungling its pre-election forecasts and said media and political elites are living in an “information cocoon” so they believe their ideology is much more popular with voters than it really is. They expected Trump’s policy outlook to remain more popular than the elite outlook, even if Trump himself ultimately loses the 2020 election.

The Global Times and its correspondents thought the greatest mistake made by the U.S. political and media class was misunderstanding the nature of Trump’s supporters

The Global Times may believe those Trump voters are misunderstood, but it wasn’t exactly gushing with praise for them either. It essentially portrayed them as selfish, short-sighted, and stubborn, but smarter than the American Left wants to admit:

Tracy Liu, a journalist based in Austin, Texas, a traditional “red state,” told the Global Times that the Trump’s base does not just include “Rednecks” or racists that hate immigrants and oppose gun control in some southern states, but also includes many normal middle class voters. These people just want to pay less taxes and support the idea of small government. They do not approve of Democrats’ ideas of high welfare and high taxes. “It’s unfair to judge them because they’re only able to take care of their families with their limited income,” Liu said. These silent Trump supporters’ mindset is just the same as the “America First” idea promoted by Trump — “as long as they can take care of their families, the homeless African Americans on the street are not a part of their concerns,” Liu added.

The Global Times followed up this reappraisal of Trump voters with criticism of him for increasing social division during his first term.

“The soil that can grow a presidential candidate like Trump still exists in the US, and four years later, Republicans can have another Trump-like candidate — even the Democrats could have their own ‘Trump,’” predicted Xin Qiang of the Center for American Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University."
691,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/05/chinese-media-jokes-beijing-is-for-biden-city/,Chinese Media Jokes: ‘Beijing Is For-Biden City’,"China’s state-run Global Times said on Thursday that Chinese “netizens” are greatly enjoying the chaotic aftermath of Tuesday’s U.S. election, trading numerous jokes and puns at the expense of both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Chinese Communist Party controls social media, and hence what “netizens” say, so the commentary the Global Times covered does not actually represent Chinese public opinion outside of communist-approved speech.

Some of the puns were based on Biden’s name sounding like “forbidden” in English or baideng, which means “waiting for nothing,” in Chinese. For example, one Chinese social media user said, “If Biden is elected, I can really see China-U.S. relations go smoother, as Beijing is For-Biden City.” The ancient Chinese imperial palace in what is now called Beijing was colloquially known as “The Forbidden City.”

The jokes directed at Trump were decidedly less pleasant in tone:

Yet many onlookers also expressed their pity for Trump, who has been given the nickname as “Trump the nation builder” by Chinese netizens, as they believe he is contributing to China’s rise by accelerating his own country’s decline, with some netizens saying that “baby Trump has brought us so much fun during his four-year presidency.” One Chinese netizen made a map of the US covered with red, with Trump standing in front of the map, cheering, “wow, check out all the red states.” Another two bystanders were drawn in the picture whispering, “You tell him that’s the COVID-19 map.” The tight election race also sets a positive example for those hard working people in China. “Thinking about those two old fellas, both in their 70s, still fighting so hard for a job, despite the money they own; can you excuse yourself from working hard?”

The Global Times thought that Trump cartoon was cute enough to reproduce in its article:

According to the Global Times, Chinese social media users doubt relations with the United States will improve much no matter which candidate prevails, and they expect unrest in the U.S. to continue long after the ultimate outcome of the election is determined.

“After Trump’s four-year presidency, the country won’t be United States anymore, it will be Separated States, no matter who wins,” one Chinese observer predicted."
692,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/11/05/north-korea-bans-indoor-public-smoking-still-claims-zero-coronavirus-cases/,"North Korea Bans Indoor Public Smoking, Still Claims No Coronavirus Cases","North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA), a communist rubber-stamp legislature, passed a law on Wednesday banning smoking in public areas, locations used for “ideological education,” and health and child facilities.

The law, North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun state newspaper reported, is intended to protect the health of citizens. Lawmakers also passed new provisions to make more North Koreans into “patriotic working people.”

The law passes as experts outside the repressive country believe that dictator Kim Jong-un is fighting an increasingly severe wave of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, exacerbated by North Korea’s nearly nonexistent healthcare system and its close proximity to the origin of the virus, China, and Russia, which has documented one of the world’s highest coronavirus case rates. The communist government in Pyongyang continues to deny that it has documented a single case of Chinese coronavirus within its territory in its history.

The anti-smoking law raised questions among outside observers about Kim’s health, as well, as the dictator often appears in state propaganda photos smoking and is believed to be a heavy smoker. The law does not appear to affect smoking in private, which would indicate that Kim could continue to partake in the activity.

Rodong Sinmun explained:

The tobacco-prohibition law with 31 provisions stipulates the rules which all the institutions, organizations and citizens must follow in protecting the lives and health of the people and providing more cultured and hygienic living environments by tightening the legal and social controls on the production and sale of cigarettes.

The outlet also stated that “the law specifies places and units in which smoking is forbidden,” listing “places for political and ideological education,” movie theaters, schools, “public health facilities,” and public transportation.

The state newspaper claimed the lawmakers adopted the new provision unanimously. They also passed an “enterprise law” to “stipulate contents of making enterprises labor-, energy-, cost-, and land-saving ones and of making the employees patriotic working people who regard the spirit of economy as part of their mental qualities.”

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency noted that SPA meetings are uncommon in the country, as it does not undergo the same processes of lawmaking as free states do, with regular drafting, debating, and voting on legislation. It also noted that North Korea is believed to have high rates of smoking among its population and that Kim himself has a reputation for enjoying smoking. According to Reuters, nearly 44 percent of men in North Korea smoke; it is considered culturally inappropriate for women to smoke.

Reuters added:

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is known as a chain smoker who is frequently seen with a cigarette in hand in photographs in state media. Kim was spotted taking a cigarette break at a railway station in the southern Chinese city of Nanning in 2019 on his way to Hanoi for his second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The new law comes into effect as mounting evidence suggests that Pyongyang is struggling to contain its coronavirus outbreak. Prior to the law passing on Wednesday, North Korean authorities launched a website in its minimally available national Internet – separate from the global Internet, which the law bans North Koreans from accessing – to help citizens quit smoking. The website reportedly offered scientific information on the ill health effects of smoking and ways to abandon the habit. While studies remain inconclusive on the effect of smoking on Chinese coronavirus patients specifically, studies have long shown that smoking causes severe lung damage and exacerbates the effects of nearly all respiratory diseases because of the deteriorated state a smoker’s lungs are in when infected.

In March, at the height of the pandemic in China and the beginning of outbreaks in Russia, Kim announced the construction of the Pyongyang General Hospital, the first health facility of its size built in the country in years.

“Our Party analyzed and assessed the present state of public health service, medical service, in the country,” Kim said in the announcement, “and, feeling miserably self-critical of the fact that there is no perfect and modern medical service establishment even in the capital city, discussed and decided on building in this year of the 75th anniversary of its founding a modern general hospital first in Pyongyang for the promotion of people’s health.”

Last month, reports from within the country suggested that Kim had launched a campaign to crack down on the illegal production of unregulated sanitary masks, which may not meet the standards necessary to protect from disease. North Korean authorities also published a bizarre warning that dust clouds from China could bring the coronavirus into the country, which is not a concern that scientists in the free world have raised about how the virus travels.

General Robert B. Abrams, commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), said in an interview in September that American officials believe North Korea is struggling against a significant outbreak of the coronavirus, one that has resulted in the Korean border becoming more peaceful as Pyongyang funnels its efforts into fighting the virus and away from antagonizing South Korea or America.

“With COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], that has accelerated the effects of sanctions on North Korea,” Abrams told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “They closed their border at the end of January. If you just look back at the sanctions in 2017, that dropped Chinese imports by about 50 percent and then they rebounded last year.”

Abrams added that the North Korean military has “shoot-to-kill orders in place, and this is fundamentally about preventing COVID from getting into North Korea.”

North Korea’s latest update to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) this week once again claimed it had not identified a single case of the Chinese coronavirus within its borders, covering a period that ended on October 29.

“But in reality some 5,368 people are said to have tested positive, an oddly specific number suggesting an official leak, and eight of them were reportedly foreigners,” South Korea’s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported on Wednesday, claiming that number originated from anonymous W.H.O. officials.

North Korean media claimed that anti-coronavirus efforts were “steadily intensifying” on Wednesday.

“The central emergency anti-epidemic units have taken a series of measures to enclose the land, the air and the seas of the country with reliable anti-epidemic walls,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed. “The emergency anti-epidemic units across the country are ratcheting up the agitprop offensive to encourage all the working people to turn out as one in the anti-epidemic work.”"

According to the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) on Thursday, the new “hotline” appears to be primarily digital in nature, although it does include a phone number where callers can leave messages:

The hotline was rolled out “with a view to facilitating members of the public to provide or report national security related information,” according to the police website. Platforms include only WeChat, SMS and email, though the force said no-one would reply to messages and those using the line will remain anonymous. Data will be protected under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and not shared with third parties, the force added. The hotline was promoted on police social media platforms, as the public were urged to share “information, photographs, audio or video.”

HKFP quoted democracy activist Joshua Wong warning last month that the proposed hotline would be a “threat to foreign investors and expats” because the CCP’s security law “covers foreign nationals, overseas behavior, and speeches” in addition to words and deeds on Hong Kong soil.

The BBC quoted both supporters of the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong government approving of the new hotline because it would help police “strictly enforce the law” and “bring traitors to justice,” while critics worried about the obvious potential for informants to use the system as a weapon against “people who they dislike or are in a different political camp,” as Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch put it.

Several Hong Kong democracy activists described the hotline as the sort of thing mainland China did during Mao Zedong’s brutal Cultural Revolution. Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting called it “Cultural Revolution 2.0.”

“Nowadays, Hongkongers already have the feeling that one can easily get blamed for whatever one does, and that one can easily step on a political landmine. The hotline will only intensify the chilling effect in the society,” Lam warned.

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Thursday that the hotline received over a thousand “pieces of information” in its first few hours of operation, even after significant technical issues were reported on WeChat."
694,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/11/05/chinese-communists-force-dangerous-catholic-nuns-from-convent/,Chinese Communists Force ‘Dangerous’ Catholic Nuns from Convent,"ROME — The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has forced eight Catholic nuns out of their convent in the northern province of Shanxi for their refusal to join the state-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

After ongoing harassment, surveillance, and intimidation from local authorities, the nuns finally opted to abandon their convent after officials ordered the removal of the cross and a dozen religious statues from the building and grounds, Bitter Winter reported this week.

“The cross is a symbol of salvation. Removing it felt like cutting our own flesh,” one of the nuns said. “Had we refused to take it away, the government would have demolished the convent.”

“Officials declared us ‘dangerous persons’ and repeatedly harassed us,” the sister said. “They asked us to write down what we had done since kindergartens [sic] and demanded to disclose everything we did over the past few months. They even wanted us to remember the license plates of the vehicles we used during our trips.”

As part of their surveillance of the nuns, local authorities had installed four surveillance cameras in the convent to monitor the sisters and their visitors.

China’s “underground” Catholic Church has faced increasing persecution since the signing of the Sino-Vatican agreement in September 2018, writes China expert Steven W. Mosher. https://t.co/ppzH5mxUQL — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 9, 2020

“Three persons, a police officer and two local officials, were assigned to keep watch over us,” the nun said. “They often went inside the convent to inquire about our activities, sometimes at night. The government even hired some thugs and ruffians to harass us. They would get into the kitchen while we cooked to mess around or act lasciviously, inviting us to have dinner with them.”

According to Bitter Winter writer Zhang Feng, hostility toward the nuns is indicative of efforts by the CCP to intensify “intimidation and persecution of Catholics who refuse to join the Patriotic Church.”

Bitter Winter also noted that persecution against Catholics actually increased ahead of the renewal of the 2018 Vatican-China accord on the naming of Catholic bishops in October.

“The Communist Party is exerting even more severe suppression on religion than during the Cultural Revolution,” said one member of a Catholic church in Hebei’s Shenzhou city that was shut down in September.

Many members of the underground Catholic Church in China, which is faithful to Rome, have resisted joining the Patriotic Association for fear of being “completely controlled by the CCP, cut off from God,” one Chinese Catholic told Bitter Winter.

While China’s state-controlled media have praised the Vatican’s secret deal with the CCP, which cedes some authority of appointing bishops to Beijing, a growing coalition of human rights advocates and Church leaders have expressed their consternation at the Vatican’s silence over the egregious human rights abuses perpetrated by the CCP.

Despite the Holy See’s constant appeals to end human rights abuses elsewhere, Pope Francis and other Vatican figures have refrained from criticizing China’s horrific violations of religious liberty, presumably to avoid offending Beijing.

Earlier this year, Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said the Vatican “got it badly wrong about China” in its agreement with the Communist Party.

“It is very sad, but under Xi Jinping things have gone backwards in China,” Patten told the Tablet, a UK-based Catholic journal, adding that it was “bizarre” for the Vatican to warm to the Communist Party at this time.

“How can you have a rapprochement on religious issues with China when there are a million or more Uighur Muslims locked up in Xinjiang?” asked Patten, who has been chancellor of Oxford University since 2003.

“Any uncertainty in the most powerful world economy in one of the largest countries has and could potentially have negative consequences for global affairs, first of all for the global economy. Meanwhile, we will see how long this uncertainty period lasts and how strong this influence is,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Peskov said the Russian government has no official position on the current state of the election count.

“The results of the US election haven’t been announced yet and it’s impossible to make comments in the current situation. We would rather take our time and wait for the situation to become clearer,” he said.

Pressed further for comment, Peskov said any comment made by the Russian government would be like waving “a red rag to a bull,” given American allegations of Russian meddling in previous elections.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was less circumspect, claiming on Thursday that the “obvious shortcomings of the American electoral system are evident” after Tuesday’s vote.

Zakharova said these shortcomings are “partly due to the archaic nature of the relevant legislation and the lack of regulation in a number of fundamental points.”

Russia, by contrast, simply makes it illegal to run against the strongman in power, stuffs its ballot boxes with more advanced (but less subtle) techniques, and takes very strong measures to adjust the attitudes of anyone who complains too strenuously about the process.

Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, having narrowly survived his most recent attitude adjustment session, humorously commented on the U.S. race on Wednesday morning: “Woke up to check who won on Twitter. Still unclear. Now that’s what I call elections.”

The Moscow Times found Russian politicians generally more pessimistic about the situation in America than Navalny.

“The election results are the worst for America. Both candidates declared victory, while Trump also [claimed] multiple election irregularities. This election certainly won’t have a legitimate outcome. No matter who wins in court, half of Americans won’t consider him the legitimate president,” lawmaker Vyacheslav Niknonov of the governing United Russia party predicted.

Other Russian politicians anticipated little change in U.S.-Russia relations no matter which candidate wins, and took the lack of complaints about Russian meddling in the 2020 election as a sign the issue of “foreign interference” is no longer relevant in American politics."

The Times regularly predicts the downfall of American civilization and has referred to the United States in the past as “primitive.” Columns in the newspaper often portray Chinese-style communist totalitarianism as a superior government model to America’s free society, comparing its “harmony” — the product of criminalizing political dissent — favorably to the “chaos” of a state in which citizens can vocally disagree.

“Disputes, chaos, and the refusal of election results by certain candidates were supposed to take place in developing countries where political conditions were not stable, and definitely not in a country like the U.S.,” the Global Times claimed in its article Wednesday, not offering audiences the precedent of several heavily contested American presidential elections in the past century. “But things have changed — all these have occurred in the US, and the US is not synonymous to a stable, civilized and consensus-based society anymore.”

“What is happening during the U.S. election is something that we could have never imaged in this ‘Beacon of Freedom,'” the article continued, referring to the high volume of opinions aired publicly without fear of reprisal from the state. The Global Times lamented that democracy must be “civilized and graceful,” and America’s is not.

The newspaper also made the bizarre claim that Americans “went panic-buying” before the election, not offering any evidence of where this occurred. Some supermarkets saw an increase in purchases of basic goods like toilet paper and water, but in response to the growing number of Chinese coronavirus cases around the country, not the election.

Elsewhere in the newspaper on Thursday, an article cited Chinese “experts” who declared assertively, “social unrest or chaos cannot be avoided” in America.

“Anxiety, suspicion and civil unrest in cities across the U.S. are seemingly pushing the most powerful country in the world to chaos and turmoil, as the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, one of the most bruising races in modern times, remains unsettled a day after polls closed,” the Global Times predicted. “Chinese experts fear that the US could be plunged into a political and even constitutional crisis.”

The Global Times experts expressed particular concern that President Donald Trump may use his rights as an American citizen to file lawsuits in states where his team documents irregularities. “Trump would use any excuse to reject the result of the election, which could end up with a protracted lawsuit,” one of the experts, a professor, said.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has steadfastly refused to offer any commentary on behalf of the Communist Party regarding the American presidential election, so the Party’s propaganda outlets provide the most direct window into Beijing’s take on the elections. The Global Times‘ predictions of chaos and demise echo its coverage throughout the entirety of the Trump era, however, rather than a newly-developed analysis more centered on the details of the election.

In 2018, the Global Times branded the country the “Divided States of America” and predicted that the “increasingly confident Chinese people” would overtake Washington in global political influence because Americans had the right to disagree freely on matters of policy in their country.

“The U.S. we are now interacting with is a ‘Divided States of America,’” the newspaper asserted. “Those who support Trump and those against him are deeply divided. Not only China, but other countries have also felt it is difficult to deal with the U.S.”

“From the protests against Trump, Chinese people found the schism in the U.S. is becoming increasingly serious and are questioning the reliability and universality of the Western democratic system,” it claimed.

The Global Times also blamed the United States for global “chaos” in general that year. A year later, it declared that Western democratic systems were obsolete and, soon, “all countries will need China.”

“The West’s old political and economic tools can no longer solve current problems,” the Global Times proclaimed. “For China, the key is to develop, fully open up and make friends worldwide. When globalization is eroded, we should remedy it. As the world falls into disorder, all countries, including the U.S, will need China.”

In April, shortly after lockdowns to prevent the spread of the Chinese coronavirus began to decimate the American economy, the Global Times called America a “primitive society” for not undertaking the same policies that China took in response to the virus, which included welding people shut in their homes and, multiple reports claimed, deliberately undercounting coronavirus cases.

“To put it bluntly, the U.S. is no match for China in terms of anti-epidemic organization and mobilization. The U.S. political system has been hit by the pandemic on its weak side and we were willing to show understanding for that. After all, every system has its weaknesses,” the newspaper claimed.

China is currently battling an extended outbreak in Xinjiang, its largest province and home to its extensive concentration camp system, where the communists have imprisoned at least 1 million Muslims.

Sen. Adrei Klishas and State Duma deputy Pavel Krasheninnikov, both members of the United Russia party — to which Russian President Vladimir Putin once belonged — will introduce the bill to the Duma, or Russian legislature, according to Interfax.

“The bill establishes the effect of guarantees of the ex-president’s immunity beyond the term of his presidential powers,” Klishas said.

Putin has faced a steady stream of corruption allegations during his time in office, aimed both at his personal actions and those of the United Russia party, which has consistently supported him.

Incumbent Russian presidents currently enjoy immunity while in office but are susceptible to legal scrutiny after their time in office has ended. The current proposal would extend that immunity until death, but allow the legislature to rescind such protections with a 2/3 vote in the Federation Council and State Duma within three months of the president leaving office if he stands accused of treason or serious felonies.

Russian state media outlet RT noted that the bill would also extend presidential immunity to include time prior to ascending office — Putin first became president in 2000 — and also covers his time as prime minister from 2008 to 2012; the legislation also reportedly would protect Putin’s family.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he could work with Joe Biden in a new administration, citing common ground he shared with the Democrats over a shared embrace of Soviet ideology. https://t.co/qUPEN7VfB2 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 7, 2020

The state-run outlet suggested the move would prompt speculation about an imminent Putin departure, despite recent constitutional reforms extending his potential time in office.

“For some, the bill will be interpreted as a clear sign that Putin is preparing the ground to leave the post of president sooner rather than later, despite a recent constitutional amendment allowing him to potentially stay in power until 2036, should he win re-election,” RT reported.

In March of this year, Putin signed into law constitutional reforms that would allow him to seek an additional two terms and thus, remain in office until 2036. An additional reform granted former presidents a lifetime seat in the Federation Council (Senate).

Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia’s third president from 2008-2012, is the only living former Russian president since Boris Yeltsin, the first officeholder, died in 2007."

While Boris Johnson made clear on the eve of talks resuming today that the country was ready to walk away from the European Union without a deal at the end of the year, nevertheless he was apparently keen to emphasise that the government still wanted to sign a deal if possible. Indeed, Mr Johnson said the government would “redouble efforts to reach a deal” on Sunday night.

He said: “I think it’s there to be done, the broad outlines are pretty clear… We just need to get them to do it if we can”, The Times reported.

Despite the enthusiasm, it remains clear that the EU still wants to see Britain make concessions in return for a deal, with the paper noting the bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier was still calling on the UK to compromise.

Report: Biden Would Announce 'Declaration of Support' for EU and Abandon Brexit Britain https://t.co/UnD1vhI2tl — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 1, 2020

This impression was fortified on Monday when Barnier took to social media to outline his programme for the week, when he wrote that there were “three keys to unlock a deal”.

While cosseted in superficially reasonable language, Barnier’s comments reveal that, ultimately, the European Union’s position has not changed. The French politician wrote that there should be “effective governance and enforcement mechanisms between international partners” — a clear reference to Britain remaining subject to Europe’s courts in case it steps out of line.

Continuing that theme was Barnier’s second ‘key’ to unlock a deal, “Robust guarantees of free and fair trade & competition based on shared high standards, evolving coherently over time”. This assertion that Britain would remain tied to European laws and standards — as well as rules on state aid — if enacted again would amount to a Brexit in name only.

Finally, the Brexit negotiation leader said “reciprocal access” to fishing was required for a deal. This remains one of the key points of friction between the United Kingdom and the European Union; EU ships have enjoyed major fishing access to UK waters for decades and are reluctant to give up this perk when Brexit is finally enacted. Remarkably, European boats land more than 60 per cent of the catch in the rich fishing waters around the UK.

Brexit leader Nigel Farage has called Britain regaining full access to those waters the “acid test” of Brexit and the government will fear being held to account by Brexiteers if it fails to deliver on that totemic area."

Mr Farage said that he know’s the President “well enough to understand that losing is not in his vocabulary,” and claimed that if allegations of fraud and irregularities are not investigated then Trump supporters will not accept the election as legitimate.

“In states like Wisconsin, there are counties with suspiciously high turnouts of over 90 per cent. Questions have further been raised as a result of large ballot paper dumps taking place after the polls closed in several states,” Farage claimed in Newsweek.

The veteran political campaigner compared the newly introduced mail-in voting system in the U.S. to the postal voting on-demand system that implemented by former British prime minister Tony Blair around 20 years ago.

“As with so many things involving Blair, it has been disastrous. In the early years, no proof of identity was even required to vote in this way. This ridiculous system has contaminated British politics,” he alleged.

Farage Predicts UK-Style Postal Voting Fraud Will Be Found, Trump Will Be Back in 2024 If He Loses https://t.co/lUuq4BfATB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 5, 2020

The leader of the new anti-lockdown Reform Party, formerly the Brexit Party, pointed to the Peterborough by-election in 2019, in which a convicted “electoral fraudster” was seen at the poll stations wearing a Labour Party rosette.

“When members of the Brexit Party knocked on doors in the centre of Peterborough, initially people were happy to talk to us about their blank ballot papers having been collected. When we returned, no doors would open to us,” he claimed.

Other examples of voter fraud in the postal system have been recorded in Tower Hamlets, Birmingham, and Bradford.

“A 2016 government report into the practice found that it is open to ‘fraud, undue influence, theft and tampering.’ To this I would add that that Left is much better than the Right when it comes to cheating,” Farage asserted.

The longtime ally of the President took aim at the mainstream media, for having incorrectly “wrote off Trump’s chances of winning” and calling the President a “bad loser”.

“They are wrong to do this,” he wrote, explaining: “These are the same people, by the way, who refused to accept Trump’s legitimacy in 2016 and have used every dishonest trick in the book to discredit him ever since.”

Yet Farage said that the onus will now be on Trump to produce “lots of evidence” of illegal conduct and voter fraud, saying that teams have already been deployed to the battleground states to launch legal challenges.

“I have no idea whether any of the legal challenges underway will succeed, but if Trump does produce overwhelming evidence of abuse, his 69 million fanatical followers will believe that Biden stole the election,” he said.

Mr Farage concluded that should the tides turn against Trump, then he will only consider it a “temporary setback,” saying: “He will also consider himself to be the victim of the establishment and he will launch the campaign for 2024 in the next few weeks.”

On Wednesday, the House of Commons passed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s lockdown proposal by a margin of 516 to 38, which ordered the closure of all “non-essential” businesses, including pubs and restaurants, supposedly until December 2nd.

Following the vote, Britons across the country poured onto the streets to celebrate their last night of freedom.

Things took a violent turn, however, in Merseyside, where police broke up celebrations on the eve of Bonfire Night for violations to the regional coronavirus restrictions that were already in place.

Police issued three COVID-19 £10,000 fines for alleged breaches of the lockdown after a bonfire party was held on public land in the Wirral. Two men, aged 36, and a 43-year-old woman were handed fixed penalty notices for the supposed breaches.

As local police and firefighters descended on the party, a number of young people began launching fireworks at the emergency workers. Thankfully, no one was injured in the attack, according to a police statement.

Firefighters came under attack from people throwing fireworks tonight in #Speke. Firefighters are NOT targets. They are human beings with families & loved ones. They go out each day & night to keep YOU, the people of #Merseyside safe. Treat them with the respect they deserve. pic.twitter.com/uVFQOpv4hN — Mersey Fire (@MerseyFire) November 4, 2020

Chief Inspector Matthew Moscrop said: “There was a blatant disregard for COVID-19 restrictions, with hundreds of people in attendance drinking alcohol, mixing with other households and ignoring social distancing.”

“We have consistently encouraged people to comply with guidance and explained why it is so important. But when someone so brazenly flouts legislation it leaves us with no option but to take strong enforcement action,” he added.

CI Moscrop encouraged people to abide by the restrictions and avoid having any bonfires or parties on Thursday, saying that the police “will not hesitate” to take action against any illegal gatherings.

“We have now entered a month of further national restrictions, and it is more important than ever that we all play our role in stopping the spread of coronavirus,” he concluded.

Elsewhere across England, a mass brawl erupted in the beachside city of Brighton, where approximately 20 people engaged in the violence, two of whom were arrested. One man suffered serious injuries and was hospitalised.

In Central London, revellers packed into bars in the popular nighttime district of Soho. No arrests were recorded, according to the BBC. Others packed into their cars to flee the city into the countryside before the lockdown restrictions came into place.

On Thursday, a ‘Million Mask‘ demonstration was planned by the anti-lockdown activist group Stand Up X in London.

The march coincided with Guy Fawkes Night, the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the State Opening of Parliament in 1605.

The killer, a Sri Lankan man who can be identified at ‘GR’ due to the judges protecting his identity, came to Britain in 2002 aged 28 and lodged an asylum claim which was rejected as illegitimate. lodging an appeal against the decision, which was also rejected, and then another citing the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the Euorpean Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in British law.

As bogus asylum seekers are not detained until their deportation can be arranged, however, he remained at large, and “committed a number of criminal offences following the refusal of his appeal” in the meantime, according to an Upper Tribunal judge.

In 2006 his criminality worsened, and he was “handed two short jail terms for assault, and later that year a further assault led to a hospital order,” according to the Daily Mail — but his deportation was still not carried out.

Finally, in 2010, he killed a man living in the same sheltered accommodation, stabbing him 21 times — but even this was not enough to him removed from the country, and in 2019 he lodged another asylum claim which accepted by a lower asylum and immigration tribunal on “human rights” grounds.

Judges Block Deportation of Migrant Drug Dealer, Cite ‘Human Rights’ https://t.co/6ZcSJZAX6x — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 12, 2020

Priti Patel’s Home Office appealed this decision in December — the fourth hearing concerning the migrant’s place in the country — but the Upper Tribunal agreed with the decision to let him remain.

Judges frequently prevent the removal of illegal migrants from Britain — grounding an entire removal flight to Spain, a safe, first world EU member-state, just this September — as well as criminal migrants, whether they originally arrived legally or illegally.

In 2017, for example, the Court of Appeal ruled it would “not be fair” to deport a paedophile from Zimbabwe, not because the Government did not have just grounds to remove him but because its lawyers had taken too long to make the correct arguments to remove him.

In June this year, a judge ruled that a Taliban terrorist who already had an asylum claim rejected and lost six taxpayer-funded appeals could stay after all, because Afghanistan would not do as good a job as the British health service of providing him with free healthcare for the PTSD he supposedly acquired while fighting in the country — against Britain and its allies.

The Conservative Party has pledged for years that it will take action to increase deportations and change the laws which allow judges to keep dangerous foreigners in the country, but in fact, they have fallen to their lowest level in years.

Priti Patel has suggested that meaningful action will, finally, be taken months from now when the Brexit-in-name-only “transition” period finally expires at the end of 2020 — but changes to the Human Rights Act would still be needed to make a difference, as well as an exit from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, which is not an EU institution and will continue to be able to enforce the European Convention in Britain regardless of its EU membership and regardless of whether or not the domestic Human Rights Act is changed or abolished.

Boris Johnson’s government is not seriously discussing doing any of this, however, despite having a substantial parliamentary majority — and it has even offered assurances to the EU that it will remain committed to the European Convention after 2020.

Once again, the courts ignore the interests of the community with dire consequences. This is another example of why the asylum system is in desperate need of reform.https://t.co/Vyrn8CZzF3 — Migration Watch (@MigrationWatch) October 21, 2020

Mohamad, who led the Muslim-majority country as recently as March 2020, had said that “Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past” on the same day a gruesome terror attack took place at a church in Nice, which was itself something of an epilogue to the public beheading of teacher Samuel Paty near Paris.

Twitter ruled that Mohamad’s tweet violated its rules against “glorifying violence” but initially allowed it to remain visible to his 1.3 million followers, deciding it may be in the public interest to do so, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

It reversed this decision and took the tweet down amid significant public anger — but the rest of the thread remains available, including a subsequent tweet asserting: “Since you have blamed all Muslims and the Muslims’ religion for what was done by one angry person, the Muslims have a right to punish the French.”

Facebook has removed the rant in its entirety.

The belated action by Twitter to take down one of Mohamad’s tweets falls well short of the action demanded by the French government, which told the managing director of Twitter’s French operations that “The account must be immediately suspended. If not, Twitter would be an accomplice to a formal call for murder.”

The Malaysian elder statesman’s rant was also condemned by the Australian government, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of the conservative-leaning Liberal Party branding his comments “absolutely absurd”.

“Of course [Muslims] don’t have that right,” he said, in reference to the Malaysian’s remarks that “Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people”.

“It’s just abhorrent to suggest anyone has such a right,” Morrison added, insisting that “the only human response to [the attack] is to be utterly devastated by it and stand with families who would be suffering so much.”

Writing in the Financial Times, the centrist French premier said that while France is not fighting against Islam, it is battling “Islamist separatism”, which is antithetical to the secular values of the French Republic.

Mr Macron remarked that since 2015, it was “clear” that “there are breeding grounds for terrorists in France”.

He continued: “In certain districts and on the internet, groups linked to radical Islam are teaching hatred of the Republic to our children, calling on them to disregard its laws.

“That is what I called ‘separatism’ in one of my speeches. If you do not believe me, read the social media postings of hatred shared in the name of a distorted Islam that resulted in Paty’s death.

“Visit the districts where small girls aged three or four are wearing a full veil, separated from boys, and, from a very young age, separated from the rest of society, raised in hatred of France’s values.

“Speak to government prefects who are confronted on the ground with hundreds of radicalised individuals, who we fear may, at any moment, take a knife and kill people.”

Court Approves Closure of Controversial Paris No-Go Suburb Mosque https://t.co/Fn8Lky9XcO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2020

The French President made the remarks after Chechen refugee and Islamic extremist Abdoulakh Anzorov murdered and beheaded teacher Samuel Paty last month. Anzorov committed the attack because the teacher had shown his class Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, during a lesson on freedom of expression.

Subsequently, a Tunisian migrant who had not long been in France, Brahim Aouissaoui, killed three in a knife attack on the grounds of a church in Nice while shouting “Allah hu Akbar” ([my] god is greater [than yours]). One woman was almost beheaded near the font.

Macron was swift in defending French secularism and the right of freedom of expression, sparking protests across the Muslim world, threats by Al-Qaeda, and death threats against teachers and other officials in France.

After the beheading of Mr Paty, Macron began shutting down Islamist associations, and even closed a mosque in Pantin which shared on social media the fatwa call against the teacher before his murder. French police also investigated dozens of people who expressed support for Anzorov and the killing of Paty, including children as young as 12, resulting in a number of convictions and imprisonments.

Interior Minister Gérard Darmanin also said in the wake of Mr Paty’s killing: “It is easy to see how political Islam joins radical Islam and ultimately leads to terrorism.”

“We must fight political Islam with the same force as terrorism,” he added.

Darmanin is not the only political figure to invoke “political Islam”, which author Ayaan Hirsi Ali describes as “a political ideology”.

“Political Islam rejects any kind of distinction between religion and politics, mosque and state. Political Islam even rejects the modern state in favour of a caliphate,” Ms Ali wrote in 2017. She added that for those reasons, political Islam is “fundamentally incompatible with the U.S. Constitution and with the ‘constitution of liberty’ that is the foundation of the American way of life” — and by extension, incompatible with any Western democracy.

In the wake of Monday’s Islamist terror attack in Vienna, committed by ethnic Albanian Kujtim Fejzulai, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said this week that Europe must “fight resolutely” against “political Islam”, the “ideological basis” behind Islamist terrorism.

Noting that he has been in contact with President Macron, he said that the EU must do “much more” to fight political Islam.

“I expect an end to misunderstood tolerance and finally an awareness in all the countries of Europe about how dangerous the ideology of political Islam is to our freedom and to the European way of life,” Chancellor Kurz said.

On Wednesday, Sang pleaded guilty to the attempted arson of the British flag on the Cenotaph, and will be sentenced at a date to be determined at Southwark Crown Court.

On June 7th, the BLM arsonist was filmed holding a lighter to the flag adorning the war memorial, which was erected in honour of the soldiers that lost their lives in the First World War and now commemorates all the fallen in Britain and her former Empire.

Following the incident, Sang told police, according to The Sun: “I didn’t rip it. I tried to set fire to it.”

Sang’s girlfriend also reportedly claimed that the BLM protester was unaware that the monument was the Cenotaph. The lawyer representing Sang said that the convicted arsonist “wants to apologise”.

On the same day as the attempted arson of the war memorial, Black Lives Matter protesters defaced the statue honouring British war-time leader Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The day prior — which coincided with the anniversary of the D-Day landings — BLM graffiti was scrawled on the Cenotaph.

In contrast to the nearly four months that it took to convict Sang, a pro-statue counter-protester was arrested, charged, convicted, and imprisoned within days of urinating beside a memorial to deceased Police Constable Keith Palmer, seemingly unwittingly.

During nationwide unrest following the death of George Floyd in America, radical Black Lives Matter activists have launched a campaign of vandalism targeting monuments honouring British historical icons.

On the same day as the attempted arson at the Cenotaph, the supposedly peaceful protest movement ripped down the statue of Sir Edward Colston in Bristol, before dragging it through the streets and throwing it into the harbour.

Also in June, leftists at BLM protests vandalised the statue honouring the American president Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated for his efforts to free America’s slaves, as well as a statue honouring the 19th-century British monarch Queen Victoria in Leeds.

Amidst the furore, London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan announced the creation of a ‘Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm‘ to audit statues and monuments in the British capital for removal.

Shortly thereafter, the left-wing Labour Party he represents followed suit at scale, announcing that it would be reviewing all statues within all 130 local councils under their control.

In October, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government pushed back against the iconoclastic movement, empowering Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick with the authority to veto the removal of any monument.

The chairman of Policy Exchange’s History Matters Project, former equality tsar Trevor Phillips, said at the time: “In recent months, Policy Exchange has documented more than 100 cases where aspects of our shared past – from statues to street names and what is taught in schools and universities – are being erased, without genuine debate and with very little consultation with the public who pay the bills.”

“We should recognise changes in public sentiment, but our response in a democracy must not be driven just by those who shout loudest. It is very welcome news that ministers will be able to ensure that if change takes place it will be by public consent rather than by extremist coercion,” he added.

Twenty-year-old Fejzulai, who killed four and injured 22 during a shooting spree in Vienna on Monday, was later confirmed to have been convicted of terrorism offences in April 2019 after he attempted to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

In 2018, he travelled to Turkey, a transit state to Syria, but Turkish police arrested him two days later in a jihadist safe house. The ethnic Albanian was imprisoned in Turkey for four months before being deported to Austria.

Still considered a “young adult”, he was only subject to Austria’s juvenile courts, and was conditionally released just 14 months into his 22-month sentence. Officials have now revealed that he was on a deradicalisation programme while in prison and managed to deceive his probation officer into deciding he was no longer a terrorist threat.

Broadcaster ORF reports that without the ruling by the deradicalisation panel, Fejzulai would not have been eligible for early parole on December 5th, 2019.

The director-general for public security, Franz Ruf, said that the jihadist had “shown himself to be reformed” and “apparently had complied with all of the conditions — namely those of the probation service and the deradicalisation programme”. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer remarked in more blunt terms that the Islamist had managed to “deceive the judiciary’s deradicalisation programme”.

Vienna Gunman Was ISIS Sympathiser, Convicted Terrorist Released Early from Prison https://t.co/0rHNBQGxz7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 3, 2020

For more than one reason, the Islamist terror attack committed by Kujtim Fejzulai in Vienna on Monday bears similarity to Usman Khan’s November 2019 attack on London Bridge.

Khan was also a convicted terrorist who had been released early. He had been attending a post-release rehabilitation programme when he fatally stabbed two people, both of whom were running the rehabilitation event. Further, a report into the rehabilitation of Islamist inmates conducted by Kings College London noted that Khan “was considered a success story of an extremist turning their life around”. His lawyer also said that he had been “deceived” into believing his client had been reformed.

The KCL report, published in July, concluded that jihadist prisoners were engaged in widespread “false compliance” — which researchers said was based on the Islamic concept of “taqiyya”, using deception to hide one’s real intentions — during deradicalisation programmes to convince authorities and parole boards that they were reformed and would not pose a threat upon release.

Islamist Adel Kermiche, who beheaded 85‑year‑old Catholic priest Jacques Hamel in France in 2016, had also employed false compliance to aid his release from prison after previously being convicted of trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

Former al-Qaeda member turned MI6 spy Aimen Dean said that there “is no such thing as a rehabilitated jihadist” and that attempts to deradicalise do not work.

“The only way [a jihadist] can demonstrate that they’ve renounced violent extremism is if they have sung like a canary and provided damaging intelligence on the networks that recruited them,” said Dean earlier this year, calling for longer prison sentences for terrorists.

Islamist Terrorists Fooling Authorities into Thinking They’re Reformed: Report https://t.co/lSZ2Gy9i2q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 24, 2020

The remarks echoed those of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in February, who admitted that “really very few” Islamists can be deradicalised, stressing the importance of the “custodial option”.

Austria’s Justice Minister Alma Zadic explained on Tuesday that even if Fejzulai had not been under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, Austrian law states that felons must be conditionally released “after two-thirds of the term of imprisonment, if the conditions are met”.

A similar system operates in the United Kingdom, where most prisoners are automatically released on licence halfway through their sentences. Following the London Bridge attack committed by Khan — and the stabbing attack in February in Streatham, London, committed by Suddesh Amman, who had also been released early from prison — the British government passed emergency legislation to stop the automatic early release of terrorist inmates. Extremists must now serve at least two-thirds of their sentence and be deemed no longer a threat to society before early release.

The new law saw a legal challenge over the summer from Mohammed Zahir Khan, who had been convicted of terrorism offences before the law was passed, but saw the rules retrospectively applied to him and others. Zahir Khan complained that treating terrorists differently to criminals was not only a breach of human rights, but was discrimination against Muslims. The High Court ruled against him in August.

Mr Farage had been “following the Trump train” for much of the climax of the 2020 campaign, being invited to speak by the President at a rally in Pheonix, Arizona, but is now set to return to “Lockdown UK” with the election still in chaos.

“Now, to accuse people of electoral fraud is one thing, but you have to prove it,” said the leader of the Brexit Party, currently in the process of relaunching as the Reform Party.

“What we know from 20 years of bitter experience, ever since the great Tony Blair introduced wide-scale postal voting in Britain, is that it’s open to fraud, it’s open to intimidation, there are massive problems with verification,” the British political heavyweight recalled.

“Just last year the Brexit Party fought a by-election in Peterborough. We lost by 600 votes. We saw things like, on polling day, somebody with a carrier bag bringing a thousand ballots into a polling station,” he alleged.

“We knocked on doors where people told us that they had actually effectively had their ballots their blank ballot papers taken from them,” he went on.

“And yet, when we went back to try and get them to swear affidavits the doors weren’t opening,” he lamented.

Our politics is broken. The abuse of the postal vote system is part of the problem.

“But we have seen, haven’t we, in Tower Hamlets, in Birmingham, in the North, many other parts of the country, we’ve seen people go to prison over the course of the last 20 years,” he recalled.

“The French, very sensibly, don’t allow postal voting, because they’re aware of this risk,” he added.

“As we speak there are people in Philadephia, in Michigan, out there trying to find evidence… where, for example, postmarks [are] falsely put on late ballots, were people intimidated in handing over their blank papers — my guess and my hunch is they are going to find a considerable amount of evidence,” he predicted.

“What that means when this gets up to the Supreme Court, I haven’t got a clue. I simply don’t know where this goes I don’t know whether there’s going to be reballots; I don’t know whether there’s going to be a President sorted out in time for the inauguration.

“If there isn’t then Donald Trump will actually stay in place after the 20th of January because of the 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,” Farage claimed.

Postal voting fraud is 'easy', electoral commissioner says http://t.co/86IrohkCrS — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) April 23, 2015

“It’s tough for the Trump team, they’re out there trying their best to prove to fraud… If they can’t well, we’ve got a Biden presidency, but a very weak Biden presidency. That’s the reason the stock market’s going through the roof, because he didn’t get the Senate, he won’t be able to put through massive tax hikes and other very damaging economic, basically socialist measures,” he explained.

“If it is a Biden presidency,” he went on. “I want to tell you this: Donald Trump has 69 million supporters. These aren’t just people who put crosses on pieces on paper… every sense of me if this guy will not do what former presidents do, because they go to Long Island and drink coffee and play gold — Trump ain’t doing that. Trump is going to keep fighting, and he’s still the leader of the Republican Party, he’s still the best choice they’ve got — and the inroads he’s made in this campaign into Latino voters and black voters is I think a trend that’s here to stay,” he said.

“I think he’s here to stay, I think if it does turn out that he’s lost, I don’t doubt for a minute he’s going to fight again in 2024,” Farage declared.

One of the terrorists considered likely to be released is a teenage ISIS supporter who was found guilty of plotting a police beheading when he was 14 years old. The convicted terrorist is now 20; however, it is believed that he is still residing in a youth jail.

The terrorist, known as RXG — after the High Court granted him anonymity for life — became eligible to receive parole last month. Despite being handed a life sentence in 2015, he was only ordered to serve a minimum of five years in prison, as life sentences in Britain seldom are for life.

A parole hearing for RXG is set for early December after the national lockdown in England is expected to be lifted. According to court papers seen by The Times, the likelihood of the terrorist being freed is believed to be high.

Other terrorists who could be released include two men who travelled to Syria to receive weapons training, a man who tried to join ISIS and wed a nine-year-old girl, and a man who downloaded assassination manuals from a terrorist group.

It follows the release of Britain’s first al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist, Moinul Abedin, who was quietly released from prison in February, after serving 18 years for collecting almost some 200lbs of bomb-making chemicals in Birmingham.

UK: Over 160 Terrorists Released Early in the Past Seven Years https://t.co/YCr6Yjk0YU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2020

In February, the government passed the Terrorist Offenders (Restriction of Early Release) Bill, which sought to prevent the early release of terrorists. The legislation followed the Streatham knife attack, in which a convicted terrorist, Sudesh Amman, who was released after only serving half of his sentence, stabbed two people, days after his release.

The update to the law mandates that terrorists serve at least two-thirds of their prison sentence and be subjected to a review by a parole board before being released, compared to the half-term that is mandated for most criminals.

The change in the law has apparently done little to stop parole boards freeing terrorists before their full sentences are served. Over the weekend, officials disclosed that 110 have now served the two-thirds of their term required to be considered for release.

One of those terrorists to have reached the threshold is Yusuf Sawar, who was sentenced to 12 years and eight months after he was found to have travelled to Syria to join jihadists in 2013. His parole hearing is set to take place in January.

A Parole Board spokesman claimed that representatives for the body receive “rigorous training” for dealing with terrorism cases and that those deemed to be a risk to the public will not be released.

“Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our No 1 priority,” the spokesman said.

On Tuesday, Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (Jtac) upgraded the terror threat in the UK to Severe, meaning that a terror attack is “highly likely“.

The announcement followed weeks of terror attacks across continental Europe, starting with the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty, by a Chechen refugee. The 18-year-old jihadist was reportedly enraged over the teacher showing caricatures of the Muslim prophet Mohammed by the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to his class during a lesson on freedom of expression.

Following the outrage over President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the magazine’s right to free speech, terrorist attacks took place in Nice, Lyon, and in Vienna, where an Islamist gunman killed four and injured 17 more before being shot dead by Austrian police.

One video circulating on social media shows a large rubber dinghy loaded with young African males preparing to land in Lampedusa. The migrants smile and one young man waves a scarf with “Italia” written on it. The voice of someone off camera encourages them to look happy and invites them to repeat the words “freedom, freedom, Italy, freedom.”

According to official statistics, 29,952 irregular migrants have arrived in Italy by sea since the beginning of 2020, but no one knows exactly how many moved on to other European countries, how many were repatriated, and how many remained in Italy. As of this date in 2019, fewer than a third as many irregular migrants (9,944) had disembarked in Italy.

In the five years from 2014 to 2019, 498,524 migrants applied for asylum in Italy, claiming to be fleeing from threats to life and freedom, from wars and persecution, and asserting the legal status of refugees and all have been included in the reception system that offers them free food, clothing, healthcare, lodging, Italian lessons, and 35 euros a day in petty cash for small expenses until their request is definitively approved or rejected.

Asylum seekers also benefit from interpreters, cultural mediators, legal operators, social workers and other professionals considered useful for their psychophysical well-being. In the case of unaccompanied minors, social educators, children’s rights experts, and a legal guardian are added.

If the outcome of the asylum request is positive, the asylum seeker obtains international protection, has the right to reside in Italy and to enter a six-month integration program that can be extended for another six months.

If the outcome is negative, the applicant has 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, a practice entirely paid by the state including legal fees, interpreters, and cultural mediators.

Italian Island Locals Vote to End Migrant Landings https://t.co/AoFTR5VSPm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 30, 2020

Between 2015 and 2019, 435,068 asylum requests were submitted, and of these 430,382 were examined and processed. Legal refugee status was granted to 8 percent of applicants and subsidiary protection to 10 percent.

Therefore, a total of 18 percent — less than one in five — of asylum seekers obtained international protection, leading the leader of Italy’s Lega party to describe the vast majority as “fake refugees.”

Many of the migrants arriving on Italian shores flee the system and simply disappear. One of these, a 21-year-old Tunisian named Brahim Issaoui, notoriously arrived on the island of Lampedusa on September 20, then proceeded to the southern Italian city of Bari before traveling north to Nice, France.

On 29 October, Mr. Issaoui entered the Basilica of Notre Dame in Nice brandishing a knife and a copy of the Quran and proceeded to stab three people to death while repeating “Allahu akhbar” (Allah is greater). The man was shot by local police and is currently hospitalized in Nice and has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.

Poppies, which became a symbol of the fallen after they sprang up across the torn battlefields of France and Belgium in the wake of the First World War, have been sold in much of the former British Empire to raise money for military charities around Armistice Day for over a hundred years.

But U.S.-headquartered Whole Foods attempted to ban employees from wearing the symbols of remembrance this year, reportedly on grounds that they amount to “supporting a cause”.

“I was basically told… if they allowed this one particular cause, then it would open up the door so that they would have to allow or consider allowing other causes,” a whistleblower told the CBC — the Canadian public broadcaster roughly equivalent to Britain’s BBC.

“I was in shock actually. I was appalled. I couldn’t believe it,” they added.

Leftists Cancel Canadian Hockey Icon Over Pro-Veterans Day Poppy Comments https://t.co/SU083OVCwA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 11, 2019

The move was widely condemned after it gained traction in the media, however, with the government Veterans Minister personally intervening and the conservative premier of the province of Ontario, Doug Ford, announcing he would introduce legislation providing workers with an absolute right to wear the poppy, and that “no employer can force someone not to wear a poppy.”

Whole Foods ultimately reversed its decision, pleading that “Our intention was never to single out the poppy or to suggest a lack of support for Remembrance Day and the heroes who have bravely served their country” in a public statement.

“Given the learnings of today, we are welcoming team members to wear the poppy pin,” the company wheedled.

This year’s remembrance commemorations are difficult for many veterans and forces families, with many countries drastically curtailing if not outright prohibiting many traditional ceremonies due to anti-coronavirus lockdown measures.

Carlos Racitalal was convicted of four counts of attempted murder for his attacks, perpetrated on four separate occasions, at Leicestershire Crown Court, along with three counts of possession of a bladed article, according to an official Leicestershire Police news bulletin.

“The level of violence used is deeply disturbing and is one of the most shocking cases I have overseen for some time,” said Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Andrew Baxter of Racitalal’s attacks.

“Each one of these victims has been through a terrifying ordeal and it is down to fortune and the intervention of others nearby that all of them survived,” he noted.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Linden remarked that Racitalal was “one of the more frightening types of offender from the point of view of the public in that they have no inkling of what is about to happen and therefore no opportunity to take evasive action,” describing how he “went out and identified vulnerable members of the public to attack… without any reason, still less provocation.”

Racitalal received four so-called “life” sentences but three are essentially meaningless, as they are to be served concurrently, and he will be eligible for release after 22 years — meaning it is quite possible he will not serve anything like the rest of his life in prison, and the Parole Board could release him onto the streets again while he is only in his fifties.

The police bulletin avoids mentioning Racitalal’s nationality, although some local news reports note that he required an interpreter in court.

A man has been found guilty of four counts of attempted murder following four separate incidents – one of which included a 10-year-old boy being stabbed.

“This was an extremely complex investigation with very distressing circumstances,” commented

“Racitalal is an extremely dangerous man who had no concern, regard or remorse for any of his victims, who ranged from young children to an elderly man. Racitalal carried out his attacks with weapons including knives and a car, before then running away or driving off from the scene.

“The dedication and commitment of officers and staff both in the investigative team and across force led to these incidents being linked. The team then worked tirelessly around the clock determined to gather the evidence and find the person responsible.

“My thoughts and thanks are with the victims of these attacks, for their bravery, patience and co-operation during an extremely traumatic time. I hope this court result helps in some small way as they continue to move forward in their lives. “

Churchill has long been a target of ire for the radical leftist movement, which has accused the man credited with defeating Nazi Germany of being racist and a colonialist.

Internal emails seen by The Telegraph revealed that senior staff members of the Imperial War Museum said: “We must continue to have conversations around sensitive and difficult issues” and “We must have conversations in which we reflect upon and examine our own biases and preconceptions.”

Another email, which was obtained under a freedom of information request, said: “We should chat further about how we can look at Churchill’s views re: tackling sensitive topics too.”

“This is one I’m very keen to get ahead of,” the email added.

The discussions surrounding Churchill’s legacy were started by curators of the museum just days after Black Lives Matter vandals defaced his statue in Parliament Square in June.

The museum is home to the Churchill War Rooms, where the wartime Prime Minister organised Britain’s efforts to defeat Adolf Hitler and his allies.

In response to the revelation, the author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny, Andrew Roberts, said: “The IWM ought to remember that black lives mattered to Winston Churchill, which is why he fought to defend the empire on the northw-est frontier of India and to destroy slavery in the Sudan.

“It also needs to consider that there was a world war on during the Bengal famine.

“If this is just a woke box-ticking operation because of BLM, it ought to see the way ordinary people were furious with the way the National Trust tried to tie Churchill in with slavery in its recent notorious report.”

Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib called the review “utterly bonkers”, saying: Churchill’s “views” and Nelson’s legacy do not require any re-examination in light of the BLM riots. Public funds must not be wasted undermining British heritage.”

Black Lives Matter has targeted a swath of historical figures in Britain, including Admiral Lord Nelson, who has long been a target of leftists in the country.

Over the summer, BLM radicals in Britain also launched a campaign of vandalism, defacing or destroying statues of Queen Victoria, Sir Edward Colston, and even American president Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated for the role he played in freeing his country’s slaves.

In August, the British Museum removed the bust of the museum’s founder, Sir Hans Sloane from its pedestal, in a move inspired by Black Lives Matter activism.

More recently, the National Trust placed Sir Winston Churchill’s former home — Chartwell in Kent — on a BLM-style shame list, because the location has links to the “sometimes uncomfortable role that Britain, and Britons, have played in global history.”

The majority of the British public, however, is against Black Lives Matter’s push to demonise British history, with 69 per cent saying that they were proud of their heritage, according to a poll from Policy Exchange in June.

On the question of Sir Winston Churchill, 80 per cent responded that his statue in Parliament Square should not be removed, with the poll finding there was “clear support for Churchill staying put across all age groups”.

The Imperial War Museum denied that it would “reinterpret” the Churchill displays, but said: “Like any world-leading museum, IWM is always considering how its complex subject matter is presented to audiences across all of its branches and is always prepared to answer any questions which may occur as a result of political or social protest.”

The teacher is said to have received various threats after posting a cartoon of a decapitated man with a Charlie Hebdo t-shirt sticking is tongue out at a jihadist with a bloody sword.

The cartoon was originally published in 2015, shortly after the attacks on the offices of the French satirical magazine that saw 12 people, mainly staff at the magazine, murdered by radical Islamic terrorists.

According to a report from L’Obs, the teacher was forced to “hide” after the threats and the incident provoked a response from Dutch Education Minister Arie Slob, who said: “Harassment and threats against teachers cannot be tolerated under any circumstances and we strongly oppose this.”

“It’s terrible that a teacher has to hide after a lesson on freedom of expression. This is completely unacceptable. We strongly support this teacher,” he added.

Prosecutors say an investigation has also been launched to identify those sending the threats.

French Teachers Receive Death Threats Explicitly Referencing Beheading of Samuel Paty https://t.co/N9GjlIhcQT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 24, 2020

The threats come just weeks after French teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded in the street by a Chechen refugee after he showed cartoons of the Islamic prophet Mohammed originally published by Charlie Hebdo during a class on freedom of expression.

Since the terror attack, teachers in France have spoken out about the rise of Islamist ideology among their students.

Earlier this week, two 12-year-old students were placed under investigation in Strasbourg after they allegedly praised the murder of Paty.

Teachers in Morbihan also received death threats that explicitly referenced the murder of Paty and were commanded to pay a ransom of 100 bitcoin (£987,033/$1,286,797) or suffer the same fate.

In Sweden, teachers also warned that a similar attack could take place in their country as well with one high school teacher lamenting that the question was not if but when such an attack would take place.

Dreams of a Subservient U.S. Under Joe Biden,"Joe Biden, presumed victor of the 2020 presidential election as accorded by mainstream media outlets, has been cheered on by the European Union (E.U.) which believes he will be diplomatic putty compared to a combative Donald Trump.

Jean-Claude Juncker, former European Commission president, conceded Sunday that while nothing will change immediately if Biden does indeed make it to the White House, in the longer term diplomatic life will get easier.

“Things are going to get a lot easier, because Joe Biden understands Europe better than Donald Trump,” Juncker declared.

“With Biden as president, the E.U. could expect and welcome a much more predictable and constructive U.S.-E.U. relationship on trade, NATO, Iran, the Middle East and above all on climate change, if the U.S. re-enters the Paris climate agreement,” agreed Mujtaba Rahman, director of the Europe office of the Eurasia Group risk analysis firm.

Under Trump, Washington happily flexed trade muscles by slapping higher tariffs on steel and aluminium to protect American producers. A truce was reached on the promise of a mini trade deal, but that has still to be realised.

On NATO, Trump made no secret of the fact the organization was not pulling its weight financially and left the U.S. to “pay and bleed” for Europe’s defense, as Breitbart News reported.

Biden is likely to back off straight away and let Europe and Canada resume their less-than-stellar funding efforts.

What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2018

There will be other changes in foreign policy if Biden does eventually win out.

On climate change, as Breitbart News reported Biden has already stated he wants to return the U.S. to the Paris climate accord as soon as possible.

Trump argued the Paris deal placed a massive, one-sided burden on the U.S. economy, while allowing developing nations like China — which is responsible for much of the recent rise in global emissions — off the hook.

Biden has likewise signalled he wants to reverse pullouts Trump ordered for the World Health Organization and the Iran nuclear deal.

The Migration Watch UK analysis found that some 9,400 foreign national offenders (FNOs) are living free in communities across the United Kingdom, up from under 4,000 in 2012.

But despite the increasing numbers of foreign criminals, the number of deportations has fallen, with 1,000 fewer returns since 2016.

Non-EU foreign criminals make up the majority of those still residing in the country, representing 57 per cent (5,100) compared to 3,900 from European Union countries. While non-EU criminals made up the majority, they only represented one-third of all removals in 2019.

A further 9,000 foreign national offenders are currently imprisoned in Britain, making up a remarkable eleven per cent of the total prison population.

Commenting on the report, the Executive Director of Migration Watch UK, Dr Ben Greening, said in a statement seen by Breitbart London: “The massive increase in the number of foreign ex-offenders living in the community may be putting the public at unnecessary risk.

“We’ve already seen horrific cases of reoffending by those who should not have been here at all,” he added.

“The government must deliver on its promise to ensure more effective enforcement in this area,” Dr Greeining concluded.

UK: ‘Activist Lawyers’ Block Deportation of Every Single Migrant on Planned Removal Flight https://t.co/QOt5PCzfHT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 28, 2020

In the 2019 Queen’s Speech, which outlined the priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, it called for legislation to “maximise removal of foreign national offenders and deter them from returning to the UK”.

Migration Watch UK pointed out, however, that despite receiving criticism from the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders for not disclosing proper information on the number of foreign criminals who re-offend after being released from prison, the government has so far refused to “disclose the scale of the problem”.

The think tank pointed to several obstacles to deporting foreign criminals endemic in the British system at present, including “last-minute” asylum claims, judicial review applications, foreigners without proper documentation, and criminals absconding.

Judges have also blocked many efforts to deport foreign criminals by the Priti Patel-led Home Office, blocking the deportation of a knife killer and a convicted drug dealer on “human rights” grounds in October, for example.

In June, judges blocked the deportation of mostly Jamaican criminals, including a killer and a rapist, on the grounds that the migrants were briefly denied access to working mobile phones while they were being detained.

Also in June, a Scottish judge stopped the deportation of a Taliban terrorist, who had already lost six tax-payer funded appeals against his deportation, claiming that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of fighting for the jihadist organisation — against Britain and its allies, presumably — and that he required free care from Brtiain’s socialised health service that he would not be less able to access in Afghanistan.

Britain’s 94-year-old monarch, the only European head of state to have seen some service in the Second World War, training as a driver and mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, has been following government instructions to “shield” since it began regulating against the pandemic, making few public appearances — but was unwilling to sit out the country’s annual commemorations for “the glorious dead”.

The sombre flower-laying ceremony in Westminster Abbey marked 100 years since the Unknown Warrior was laid to rest.

The Unknown Warrior is a fallen soldier “Unknown by name or rank, brought from France to lie among the most illustrious of the land” following the First World War, as a focal point for the many grieving families denied the chance to lay their loved ones to rest.

“Thus are commemorated the many multitudes who during the Great War of 1914–1918 gave the most that man can give, life itself, for God, for King, and Country, for loved ones, home, and empire, for the sacred cause of justice and the freedom of the world,” his tombstone reads.

“They buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.”

p

The heavy restrictions on the traditional mass commemorations of the fallen on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day have caused considerable upset to some veterans, forces families, and patriots, however, with the public being prevented from attending the Cenotaph and most local ceremonies this year, for example.

“[Prime Minister Boris] Johnson and [Health Secretary Matt] Hancock, our prison governor and chief warder, [have] once again made normal life illegal,” complained Peter Hitchens, the Christian conservative journalist (and brother to late atheist left-wing journalist, Christopher Hitchens).

“I am not sure I will ever be able to forgive the people who made it a crime to sing O God, Our Help In Ages Past at an English village war memorial,” he wrote.

The two parties have called on the left-wing coalition government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to freeze tax collection in areas declared as “red zones,” which are seeing the strictest lockdown measures enacted to stop the spread of the Wuhan virus.

League MP Paolo Grimoldi noted that the government had suspended taxes for businesses and individuals in February during the first wave of infection and called for similar measures to be taken for the entire region of Lombardy, Il Giornale reports.

“As was done in February it must be done again today and must be done immediately,” Grimoldi said, adding: “It is easy, Minister Gualtieri only has to redo the February decree, adapting it to the whole of Lombardy.”

Swathes of Italy Locked Down Again After Being Deemed Coronavirus ‘Red Zones’ https://t.co/WeXOZBJLvW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 6, 2020

Gianluca Comazzi, a member of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, agreed with the proposal, saying he would table a motion in the Lombardy Regional Council to implement tax relief.

“Our region has faced this tragedy with dignity and courage, now we expect concrete help,” Comazzi said.

Forza Italia MP Mariastella Gelmini has also called for other regions facing lockdown to have their taxes frozen, saying: “To those who cannot work the state must not ask for a euro of taxes.”

An estimated 16 million people are set to be affected by the new lockdown measures with deaths from the coronavirus totalling nearly 450 on Thursday and the country seeing over 34,500 new cases of the disease.

As lockdowns are implemented for Italian citizens, however, the country still sees continued landings of migrants in areas like the island of Lampedusa.

League leader Matteo Salvini spoke out about the double standard for migrants on Monday, saying the lockdown edicts of the government “do not apply” to migrants coming into the country illegally.

I’m Irish.”

Vote counting in the U.S. continues in some areas and results have not been officially certified, with President Donald Trump alleging fraud and declining to concede — yet much of the mainstream media have declared Mr Biden the winner or at least the projected winner of the election regardless.

The publicly-funded British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was one such outlet — but neither this nor Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s arguably premature rush to congratulate the Democrat seems to have done them any favours, as they discovered when they asked him for a “quick word” for their viewers.

“The BBC? I’m Irish,” Biden replied, walking away with a smirk, in what has seen by some as a signal that the Democrat — who has previously made no secret of his hostility to Brexit — would not be as friendly to the United Kingdom as the half-British Trump.

As you can see from this clip, Biden hates the UK. The Conservatives had 4 years to do a trade deal with the USA and pro-UK President, and they failed. There is no chance now. pic.twitter.com/LjOSS8saz5 — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 7, 2020

“As you can see from this clip, Biden hates the UK,” commented leading Brexit campaigner and Trump ally Nigel Farage.

“The Conservatives had 4 years to do a trade with the USA and [a] pro-UK President, and they failed,” he added, referring to the much-hyped British-American trade deal endorsed by President Trump which the British could have signed after reclaiming their right to strike international trade deals from the EU.

“There is no chance now,” Farage predicted, with Britain only just having left the EU at the beginning of 2020 — years after the British people voted for Brexit — and not due exit the ongoing “transition period” which amounts to continued EU membership in all but name until the end of the year.

Regarding himself as an Irishman — although his colonial ancestor William Biden appears to have been an Englishman — Biden has been fairly clear that he takes the EU’s side in its wranglings with the British, pressuring them to give into various EU demands for continued control over their territorial fisheries and state aid and regulatory regime in the name of peace in Northern Ireland, and integral part of the United Kingdom divided between a British unionist majority and an Irish nationalist minority.

Anthony Gardner, an advisor to the Biden campaign and former U.S. ambassador to the EU, has predicted that Biden would issue a “declaration of support for the European Union” early on in an administration — “perhaps first day” — and Britain’s former D.C. ambassador Kim Darroch has also predicted that he may not give Boris Johnson a “warm, welcoming embrace”, due to “resentment” of the British leader among “some Obama people” on his team.

While votes for the presidency are still being counted — a task the Democrats were previously adamant must be completed before any declaration of victory — and no results have been certified, mainstream media outlets from CNN to Fox News have already crowned Mr Biden the winner.

President Trump and his team insist the race “is far from over”, alleging improprieties in the way ballots were cast and counted.

“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed”, he said.

Nevertheless, despite the lack of a Trump concession or certification of the results, some international leaders, perhaps seeking to curry favour with a new administration, are already rushing to congratulate the 77-year-old Democrat and his running mate — including Britain’s Boris Johnson.

“Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as President of the United States and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement,” wrote the Conservative Party politician in a message shared on social media.

“The U.S. is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security.”

Johnson’s snub to the sitting President may come as something of a surprise to observers aware of Biden’s more or less open hostility to Brexit, which stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s early, consistent, and enthusiastic support for Britain’s (still unimplemented) decision to reclaim full sovereignty from the European Union, as well as the media’s habit of referring to him as the “British Trump”.

In reality, the economically neoliberal, pro-immigration Briton has never been very similar to his American counterpart, and slammed him when he was merely a candidate for the Republican nomination, which he was not expected to win.

“When Donald Trump says that there are parts of London that are no-go areas, I think he’s betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of President of the United States,” he said in an interview in 2015, when he was Mayor of London.

“I would invite him to come and see the whole of London and take him round the city except that I wouldn’t want to expose Londoners to any unnecessary risk of meeting Donald Trump,” he added.

“I see a flag there,” the pope said in Saint Peter’s Square in the Vatican following his weekly Angelus message on Sunday. It “makes me think of the populations of Central America, hit in recent days by a violent hurricane, which claimed many victims and caused immense damage, aggravated by the already difficult situation of the pandemic.”

“May the Lord welcome the deceased, comfort their families and sustain those most in need, as well as all those who are doing all they can to help them,” the pontiff added.

Later, the pope’s media team sent out a tweet from his account, repeating the same message in several different languages.

The storm began as a category 4 hurricane on Tuesday but slowly lost force, becoming a tropical rainstorm, but the torrential rains caused extensive flooding and mudslides.

One major mudslide on a mountainside in central Guatemala buried homes in the town of San Cristobal Verapaz, leaving at least 25 dead. Two other avalanches in Huehuetenango killed at least another 12 people, and smaller slides accounted for another 5 deaths.

On Friday, search teams pulled bodies from the earth where a mudslide had buried at least 100 people, the Associated Press (AP) reported. In total, more than 100 are still missing.

Meanwhile, 19 more people died in southern Mexico from mudslides and flooded streams and rivers, Chiapas state civil defense official Elías Morales Rodríguez said.

Early Sunday, Tropical Storm Eta struck Cuba and began moving toward the southern tip of Florida and the U.S. National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm warnings for southern Florida and the Florida Keys.

Given all that has transpired between the socialist regime of Venezuela, led by Nicolás Maduro, and the Trump Administration over the past years, it goes without saying that our eyes are firmly on this election.

Your election was handled much differently than how we’re used to doing ours, and the Electoral College is still a mystery to many non-U.S. citizens. But, in many parts of the world, including Venezuela, they’re seen as a faint glimpse of that which some of us can now only dream of having: the ability to choose our leaders with freedom, to have your vote matter and mean something.

As of the time of writing this, the 2020 U.S. Presidential election is still up in the air, with rampant accusations of fraud in key states that are keeping everyone on edge over what’ll happen. Thankfully, there are trustworthy courts and legal resources that can be used to contest and solve any fraudulent results. Americans can also organize peaceful rallies to demand a fair vote count without worrying that, if the candidate they oppose wins, they may be out of a job, in jail, or worse — get their skull cracked by police in broad daylight, on video. We don’t have that here, not when the Socialist Party controls every step of the process, from the Electoral Council to our Supreme Court.

Unlike in the United States – where the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulates elections and monitors candidate expenditures for fraud, but does not have the power to call federal races – Venezuela’s Electoral Council gets to pick the winners and losers of every election here. And the people running the Electoral Council are all socialists handpicked by Maduro.

I am a little over two months away from turning 33 years old. 25 elections have been held over the past 21 years of “Bolivarian Revolution” and it saddens me to say that I don’t have a single memory of any of them occurring without some sort of controversy, or devoid of any kind of fraudulent antics that have tainted its results.

The twenty-sixth election under Chavismo, if you can call them such, is slated to take place on the 6th of December. This time, it’ll be a parliamentary one to renew the National Assembly, currently under the control of the Venezuelan opposition. The opposition won a majority there in 2015, only two years into the Maduro regime, when he had yet to perfect the fraud machine. In response, Maduro unconstitutionally created a parallel legislature, the “National Constituent Assembly,” claiming its job was to write an entirely new constitution. This year, the fake legislature abruptly declared that it wouldn’t write a constitution at all and that its members would compete in a Maduro-controlled election process for the National Assembly’s seats.

This upcoming “exercise of democracy” is a mockery of the word “election.” It’s rigged to the core. Maduro hijacked opposition parties through the Supreme Court, which placed handpicked collaborationists in control of them, and banned non-socialist candidates and politicians. The regime packed the Assembly with new seats under the pretense of population growth – despite the fact that we’ve actually shrunk as a country due to the ongoing migrant crisis that has forced almost 5 million Venezuelan citizens to flee.

Our electoral system is a contradiction because, on one hand, we have superficial safeguards that don’t even exist in the United States, like the requirement of a valid identification to cast our votes. If you do not bring your ID card, you can’t vote – simple as that (you also can’t buy toilet paper, gasoline, or do nearly anything else without it). On paper, we also count with a highly praised, robust electoral infrastructure system run by Smartmatic, a company used in the United States (despite its alleged ties to George Soros’ Open Society Foundation). Smartmatic claims it makes the process as smooth and painless as possible, audit-friendly, and able to transmit results quite efficiently.

Under the surface, the safeguards do nothing. Smartmatic denounced that it had been compromised in 2017, something that greatly complements the rampant voter coercion that always takes place in each Venezuelan election to make sure that the regime counts with enough votes to create the victory scenario that they see fit, all under a shroud of pretend legitimacy. Following the departure of Smartmatic, Venezuela’s Electoral Council recently revealed a brand new electoral system controlled in its entirety by them. If you didn’t trust the previous system, then you’ll have a harder time trusting this one.

Another safeguard in place is that Venezuela’s electoral law forbids anyone from releasing or publishing polls a week before an election, and no one — including the media — is allowed to publish results until our Electoral Council does so. But the Council is run by chavistas, so, rather than protecting the integrity of the elections, this provision just creates yet another threat of prosecution for speech the government dislikes.

Constant sham elections is how the Chávez and Maduro’s regime is presented as legitimate by international leftist organizations and Marxist ideologues – that is one of the reasons that prompted the Socialist Party of Venezuela to reform our Civil Registry Law in 2009, granting the National Electoral Council the authority to create and oversee a new Civil Registry system. In other words, the chavistas who choose winners and losers also get to decide if you exist or not.

This, coupled with their handling of our Electoral Registry that has been denounced through the years as corrupt, lets them determine who gets to vote. All they need to generate a new person is to insert them in the Civil Registry so they get a Venezuelan ID card number.

Venezuela’s institutions have a long record under socialism of creating “legitimate” documentation for people that have no business having it. For example, while acquiring a passport for an actual Venezuelan citizen is a nightmare, Syrians, Lebanese, Iranians, and Iraqis with ties to Hezbollah have had much more luck, even if they never stepped foot on Venezuelan soil. According to a defecting head of the Office of Identification and Migration (Saime), at least 10,000 Middle Easterners with no ties to Venezuela have acquired official documentation – birth certificate, passports, etc – in exchange for bribes. There is no guarantee these people aren’t voting in December.

My mother’s death certificate bears the logo of the Electoral Council. For what it’s worth, she shows up as deceased if I search her ID number in the public electoral registry lookup, I can only hope that votes under her name haven’t been cast ever since she passed away.

I lost faith in our electoral system long ago. Free and fair elections are not something you get to do here. The last time I voted was in 2013. At the time, I was working abroad and, due to that, I was registered as an abroad voter, which, while a very minuscule group, is heavily anti-chavismo leaning.

A last-minute change by our Electoral Council made it so that absentee voting from abroad was not factored in the first “irreversible” trend result announcements, therefore suppressing them for all intents and purposes. That act, coupled with the socialist regime’s constant rigging of elections, coercion of public employees and recipients of beneficiary programs, and the fact that we don’t really have much of an alternative when it comes to political parties that aren’t shades of left and/or part of the Socialist International simply translates to hopelessness and a complete lack of motivation for voting.

The very dubious and shady 2013 election was Maduro’s first victory, an urgent presidential election that was called following the death of Hugo Chávez. Maduro won it by a very narrow margin.

Despite some initial calls to protest by then-candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, he lacked the conviction to contest them all the way through — the rest is history.

Since I never bothered to update my voting registry information following my return to Venezuela in 2013, I don’t get to participate in this upcoming parliamentary elections. Quite frankly, I’m fine with that – this is, after all, a rigged game where the only winning move is not to play. There are better ways to waste one’s time than in participating in sham elections.

I am not a political analyst, and neither am I the most educated or sharpest tool in the shed, but one thing I know for sure is that the socialist regime of Venezuela is rooting for a Biden victory not because they agree with him, but because during his tenure as Obama’s vice president, he, along with Obama, showed a very lax attitude towards Chávez, Maduro, and Castro. It was a period of time during which Chávez was able to freely spread his Revolution’s influence across the region — and his oil checkbook too; that much I could witness during my short tenure as a local staff at one of Venezuela’s smallest embassies.

Maduro is looking forward to that breathing room again. Case in point, Maduro henchman and TV host Diosdado Cabello’s statements of a “Bolivarian Breeze” that could reach the U.S. — mind you, this is a man with a $10 million bounty on his head.

I do not have the liberty of sharing my political views in an open and free manner here, whether it is about foreign elections or our own. To do so would be like painting a target on my forehead, so I tread very lightly in that regard because I do not have the protection of any political party or high-ranking figurehead to shield me from the regime’s authorities. At the end of the day, I simply am a regular man taking care of my disabled brother no matter what.

“In response to the ballot question ‘Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the union as a state?,’ 52% of voters said yes, while 48% said no,” according to Bay News 9.

Tuesday’s vote was the sixth time the island’s residents made their voices heard on the issue. In 2012 and 2017, Puerto Ricans overwhelmingly supported the move, but opponents quickly dismissed the 2017 results because of low voter turnout and the question’s wording.

The report continued:

The Constitution gives Congress the right to grant statehood, but it does not establish a process for doing so. Typically, Congress requires the territory’s residents to pass a referendum – as Puerto Rico did this week – then representatives from the territory petition Congress for statehood. The Senate and House would need to approve the request and the president would have to sign it. … One major obstacle toward statehood is the impact the island might have on the country’s political dynamics. Most Puerto Ricans who have moved to the U.S. mainland have historically voted Democratic, fueling Republican fears that statehood would lead to as many as seven new left-leaning lawmakers in Washington — and seven electoral votes that are likely to go blue. Some on the island, however, have argued they believe it would be a swing state.

However, the recent favorable vote would give the statehood movement “increased leverage,” according to the Hill.

“They can use that as a way to urge and nudge Congress to act,” said Carlos Vargas-Ramos, director of public policy at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College.

Despite President Trump’s opposition to Puerto Rican statehood, in October the territory’s Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced endorsed the president for reelection and encouraged Puerto Ricans living in the United States to vote for him, according to Breitbart News.

“They have to go to vote, exercise their right to vote and evaluate who has represented being a person who thinks about Puerto Ricans and their needs at the most difficult moment: It is Donald Trump,” she said."

Human Rights Council Member-Elect Cuba,"The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention wrote in a letter to an NGO revealed Monday that it had found evidence of serial human rights violations, particularly “a systematic problem of arbitrary detentions,” in Cuba against political dissidents.

Cuba was elected in an uncontested race to a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council this year. The communist dictatorship will join the Council in 2021. The NGO U.N. Watch revealed following elections last October that 60 percent of the membership of the Human Rights Council will be made of up repressive dictatorships when the new term begins.

Cuban Prisoners Defenders, a human rights NGO, revealed the response of the U.N. Working Group to its inquiry regarding the events surrounding the arrest and conviction of José Daniel Ferrer, the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), last year. UNPACU is believed to be the island’s largest pro-democracy group. The Prisoners Defenders network works to take legal action to bring justice to individuals whose rights communist states have violated.

State security initially arrested Ferrer in October 2019 after organizing a peaceful protest honoring the feast day of Our Lady of Charity, the patroness saint of Cuba. Police disappeared Ferrer into the prison system and, when they finally allowed family to visit, relatives said he showed obvious signs of torture. Ferrer said prison guards attempted to feed him unsanitary food and regularly beat him, causing a massive weight loss and the exacerbation of preexisting health conditions.

Cuban police sentenced Ferrer to four years in prison in April. In response to international pressure, the Castro regime is allowing him to serve under house arrest, which he is doing currently. Ferrer was convicted of “assault” — the state never clarified when or against whom — and the Cuban state insists that he is an ordinary, not political, prisoner.

In a letter responding to a legal complaint on his behalf by Cuban Prisoners Defenders, which the NGO shared with Breitbart News, the United Nations found sufficient evidence to declare that the Communist Party had violated Ferrer’s rights, including specific violations of multiple United Nations human rights statutes. It urged Cuba to allow international investigators into the country if it insisted that the Party was innocent and noted that Cuban diplomats had ignored a request to visit.

The U.N. Working Group demanded Cuba reverse the four-year prison sentence against Ferrer. It did not address the issue of Cuba’s return to the Human Rights Council in less than two months.

The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is part of the U.N.’s Office for the High Commissioner on Human Rights.

Cuban Prisoners Defenders called for the removal of all repressive regimes from the Human Rights Council.

“Al Capone cannot be appointed Chief of Police, just as Cuba should not have come to aspire to be on the Human Rights Council as long as it does not respect either these or the treaties that protect human rights,” the NGO said in a statement regarding the latest U.N. statement on Ferrer’s arrest.

The U.N. Working Group confirmed several shocking details of Ferrer’s time as a pro-democracy dissident, among them the fact that Cuban state security have arrested him over 100 times since 2011. Ferrer was also arrested during the “Black Spring” protests of 2003, serving eight years in prison. The 100 arrests occurred after the state deprived him of eight years of his life.

The nature of those arrests, the U.N. confirmed, was “violent, with beatings, threats, and home invasions, stealing [his] personal belongings, including technological and communications material, food, household goods, books, or furniture.”

For his most recent arrest, the U.N. letter stated, Cuban state security sent 60 agents to Ferrer’s home with a court order to arrest him, giving him no clarity as to why he was being detained.

Cuban dissidents often report that police steal their food and basic goods, as the communist country faces severe shortages of both on a regular basis.

It also validated reports by Cuban Prisoners Defenders at the time that Ferrer was subject to routine beatings, had large hematomas around his body, and was forced to drink “fecal” water and rancid food.

The U.N. concluded that Ferrer’s arrest “was used as a tool to limit Ferrer’s peaceful exercise of the fights to freedom of opinion, expression, assembly, association, and participation [in politics], as well as to restrict his activities as a human rights defender and pro-democracy activist.”

The letter also included other forms of intimidation and outrageous manipulation to hurt Ferrer. One such incident involved an individual who was involved in a motorcycle accident.

“Political police presented itself in the hospital where the gentleman involved in the motorcycle accidents was being treated to pressure him to tell a version of events in which his injuries were caused by Mr. Ferrer García,” the U.N. noted, as the accident occurred near the headquarters of UNPACU. “Additionally, neighbors near the UNPACU headquarters had been visited by political police to force them to declare that they had witnessed an alleged fight between the individual and Mr. Ferrer García, which they refused to do.”

The U.N. noted that the Castro regime responded late to a request for an explanation regarding Ferrer’s case. It again requested that Havana allow an investigator to inspect the situation. It also concluded that, from the evidence it possessed, Cuba was systematically violating human rights. The NGO noted that the letter indicated that Cuba violates at least seven of the 11 crimes against humanity mentioned in the Rome Statute on human rights.

“This is not the first case regarding arbitrary deprivation of liberties in Cuba that the Working Group has analyzed in the past few years,” the letter read. “The conclusions … show a systematic problem with arbitrary detentions.”

Cuban Prisoners Defenders is requesting that the United Nations reconsider allowing Cuba on the Human Rights Council.

“There is no binding and authoritative monitoring and reporting mechanism on human rights in Cuba,” the NGO noted, adding, “The fact that the United Nations Human Rights Council includes a State, Cuba, that commits flagrant crimes against humanity … and that it also rejects any mechanism for reporting and monitoring human rights, is born of an evident anomaly in the definition of the Human Rights Council.”

Both Trump and challenger Joe Biden have claimed victory in last week’s election. Several left-leaning American mainstream outlets proclaimed Biden president-elect Saturday. Trump has vowed legal challenges in several swing states where conservatives say poll workers may have counted illegal votes, including votes from people who died before the election.

Trump’s definitive win in Florida triggered a deluge of hateful statements against the state’s Cuban-American population, where Trump made double-digit gains in support from 2016. A poll of Cuban-Americans released prior to the election showed that over 75 percent of Cuban refugees who fled the island between 2010 and 2015 identify as Republicans, contradicting left-wing conventional wisdom that only members of the historic Cuban exile community skew conservative. In response, Biden supporters, left-wing commentators, and celebrities have flooded social media with ethnic slurs and other insults against Cuban people.

Los 3 de la Habana grew to national prominence after releasing “Trump Song,” a lively dance hit whose chorus proclaims, “Oh my God, I will vote for Donald Trump.” The song became a fixture of Trump rallies and caravans and the band joined the Trump campaign and members of the Trump family for several events.

Love these guys!! #LatinosForTrump “Eric Trump sings with Los 3 de La Habana!!!” #los3delahabana pic.twitter.com/hKpR2GVNRh — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) October 16, 2020

The members of the group – Ana Páez, Germán Pinelli, and Tirso Luis Páez – published a live video on social media Sunday to address the negative comments they had received. They also clarified that their absence from social media in the past week was not an attempt to hide from the political controversy the nation is currently facing; they simply had a planned family vacation.

In the Spanish-language video, titled “We Are Receiving Death Threats,” the band thanked both supporters and those who, through their negative comments, keep the band relevant.

“Thank you for sending us so many messages of love. Those are the ones that stay in our heart because those people who threatened us with death – poor people, poor souls,” Ana Páez said in the video. “Poor souls, because I would be incapable of offending anyone because they think differently from us. We come from a country where we all had to think the same and thanks to this great country and democracy, we all think how we like.”

Ana Páez also thanked those sending hateful comments and “those who make the memes … keep using the song, we make money off of that!”

Pinelli asserted that, despite the death threats, “there’s no fear here” and that the group has no intention of silencing itself in the face of offenses.

“Living in a country like this, with the opportunities we have, defending democracy, that we have to respect how each of us thinks – I want to tell our people, our fans, the people who took the song and made it their anthem: don’t feel bad at all, don’t feel embarrassed! We’re not embarrassed for saying what we think,” Pinelli said.

Pinelli noted that election disputes are not over and Biden is technically not the president-elect of the country.

“I feel very proud of these people you see right here, super proud, of saying what we feel,” he continued. “I feel super proud of our family … I feel very proud of all of you, so many friends from around the world writing to us every day, thanking us for saying what we feel”

“You don’t have to thank me, you have to join me every day [in demanding] that every human being has to be free to say what they think and express what they feel – That is how we are going to find a better future for us, for our family, and for all. That’s it,” he concluded.

Tirso Luis Páez noted favorably that supporters of the president had not erupted in violence in response to major news organizations crowned Biden the winner.

“I am super proud of the 71 million people who have not gone out to burn down cities, who have not looted Walmart. Let’s keep it up, let’s keep it up, please,” Páez said. “Losing elections in a democracy is normal, not losing democracy in an election. Trump has a right to challenge things and we will wait.”

“If Biden proves he did not cheat and he becomes president, he is going to be the president of all Americans and we are not going to burn down any homes or anything,” he concluded. “We are going to respect him for four years and then choose who to vote for in four years.”

Ana Páez, who revealed herself to be a Democrat supporting Trump, noted that she had handled personal disagreements in the aftermath of the election by choosing to keep Biden supporters in her life.

“I have a lot of friends who support Biden and I was pissed at them the first few days, but then no more, because love can do it all. I love them because the first thing is to respect each other. I have to respect them, she said.

The group concluded promising to perform “Trump Song” “wherever anyone asks for it.”

The news out of Florida, presumed to be a swing state before Trump’s solid victory there – and the victories of at least two new Cuban-American members of Congress, Maria Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, in the state – prompted an outpouring of hatred against Cuban-Americans in particular, and the growing minority of Venezuelan-Americans in the state who arrived fleeing socialism at home. Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, accused Cuban-Americans of supporting the “genocide” of their own families. Left-wing agitator Al Sharpton, a Fidel Castro supporter, dismissed the support for Trump in the community as a result of “propaganda.” Biden supporters on social media eagerly revived the ethnic slur gusano (“maggot”), adopted by Castro’s supporters in the 1960s to refer to counter-revolutionary Cubans and accused Cubans, whose culture is largely influenced by their Nigerian Yoruba heritage, of being white supremacists. Black Cuban dissidents have protested for years that the majority white Castro regime systematically discriminates against them.

Cuban-Americans made significant gains in Congress, increasing their representation in the House of Representatives to three people. Joining Salazar and Gimenez will be Nicole Malliotakis, a conservative Cuban/Greek-American from New York in the House.

Nearly two days after polls closed, the outcome of the presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden remains unclear, with several states yet to certify their results and declare a winner.

Responding to the events in a televised speech, Maduro boasted that, under his socialist regime, the “electoral results are given on the very night of the elections in an exact manner.”

He then referred to the campaign for next month’s parliamentary elections, already dismissed by most of the free world as a sham. Maduro controls who can run in those elections and uses government jobs, armed militias, and food bribes to control the vote. He is expected to seize back control of the National Assembly as the majority of opposition politicians are boycotting the elections due to the regime’s record of rigging them in their favor.

“Yesterday, the electoral campaign in Venezuela began,” he said. “It is a demonstration of how in a civilized manner, in peace, we have a proven, transparent electoral system.”

In what appeared to be a barb against Trump, Maduro added that “whoever wins,” he would accept the result of next month’s elections. Given the lack of opposition and the regime’s record of sophisticated electoral fraud, the majority of those “elected” to the chamber will likely be representatives of Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV).

“We do not interfere in the internal affairs of the United States,” added Maduro. “And we hate it when they pretend to give lessons in democracy to the world.”

On Tuesday, Maduro retweeted a post falsely suggesting that armed militias supportive of Donald Trump had been tasked with intimidating voters in the run-up to the election.

Over the course of the Trump presidency, Maduro has long railed against the Trump administration, which has pursued a policy of seeking to remove him from power through the imposition of economic sanctions. Among his claims include repeatedly accusing Trump of ordering his assassination and comparing him with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

Maduro has met Biden once, at the inauguration of socialist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in 2015, where Biden complimented the dictator’s hair. “If I had hair like that, I would be the president of the United States,” Biden reportedly told Maduro. Shortly after that meeting, Maduro accused Biden of plotting his assassination.

“I accuse U.S. Vice President Joe Biden who personally spoke with the presidents and prime ministers about the plan,” he warned at the time. “The imperial power has entered a dangerous phase of desperation and has been talking to governments of the continent to announce the toppling my government.”

728,2020-11-05 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/05/bolsonaro-comforts-fans-worried-trump-hope-is-last-thing-die/,Bolsonaro Comforts Fans About Trump: 'Hope Is the Last Thing to Die',"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a conservative and vocal ally of President Donald Trump, comforted supporters concerned about the ongoing vote counts in the American presidential election late on Wednesday, asserting, “hope is the last [thing] to die.”

Bolsonaro admitted that, like millions around the world, he was riveted watching the vote counts for Trump and rival former Vice President Joe Biden trickling from battleground states and expected a fair result.

According to Brazilian newspaper O Globo, a small group of supporters met Bolsonaro in front of the official presidential residence, the Alvorada Palace, late Wednesday. Bolsonaro responded to a woman who asked “what would become of us” without him or Trump, and later to someone asking if he was following election results from America.

“What do you think? Everybody is following,” Bolsonaro responded. “It seems like the business over there is going to the courts, one state or another. Let’s wait a little bit.”

To the first question, Bolsonaro reportedly answered, “hope is the last to die.”

Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, a lawmaker, has also commented on the election through his Twitter account, sharing vote totals that some conservatives have regarded as suspect in critical states and comparing them to elections in Brazil where the socialist candidate found a surprise windfall of uncounted votes late in the process.

“The left is well-organized at a global level. That is why it is important to follow the U.S. elections,” the younger Bolsonaro wrote on Wednesday. “What happens there could be repeated here.”

President Bolsonaro has openly supported the Trump presidency throughout his tenure for sharing political values. He and Trump have met on several occasions to expand trade cooperation between the two countries and discuss international issues of mutual interest, such as the Venezuelan migrant crisis and the growing negative influence of communist China. As a result, Brazilians who support Bolsonaro largely support Trump and Brazilian-Americans who support Trump also support Bolsonaro.

“Trump is our Bolsonaro,” a Brazilian-American voter told the BBC in Miami this week.

“To be a leader, the president has to have integrity and has to know business … he has to understand how to negotiate, foreign policy is business,” another Brazilian-American said. “Trump is a good president because he is a good businessman and is direct. I think he is honest.”

In Sao Paulo, hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters organized this weekend to oppose the Chinese coronavirus policies of a rival of the president’s, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria. Several supporters carried signs reading “Go Trump!” and other pro-Trump slogans.

The Brazilian president has also clashed with Biden personally, particularly following a bizarre declaration by the Democrat during the first presidential election debate that he would attempt to destroy the Brazilian economy if Bolsonaro did not accept $20 billion from him.

“Brazil, the rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States,” Biden said. “Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, ‘Here’s $20 billion. Stop, stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.’”

Elsewhere in the debate, Biden argued that Trump had been needlessly antagonistic to global allies.

Bolsonaro responded by calling Biden a “coward” and exclaiming in an official statement, “what a shame!”

“What some have not yet understood is that Brazil has changed. Its President, unlike the left-wing presidents of the past, does not accept bribes, criminal land demarcations, or coward threats towards our territorial and economic integrity. OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE,” Bolsonaro wrote in response to Biden.

The president appeared to be referring to past socialist presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a convicted felon found guilty of using millions in public money for a luxury beachfront property, and his protege Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached out of office.

Bolsonaro also called Biden’s threats “disastrous and unnecessary.”

At press time, several key states are continuing to count votes, particularly votes sent in by mail through programs meant to keep people home to protect from the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in Michigan and Wisconsin regarding questionable vote-counting methods and the legitimacy of some mail-in votes. In states like Arizona and Pennsylvania, Republicans have expressed concerns regarding evidence that deceased individuals may have had ballots to their name or that duplicate or otherwise illegitimate ballots may be added to the final tallies. Conservative voters have begun organizing rallies in remaining states demanding a process to verify the legitimacy of votes.

729,2020-11-03 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/11/03/trump-biden-built-cages-for-immigrants-complimented-nicolas-maduros-hair/,"Trump: Biden 'Built Cages for Immigrants,' Complimented Maduro's Hair","President Donald Trump told Colombia’s most influential newspaper, El Tiempo, in an interview published Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden was a “diminished and very weak man surrounded by Marxists,” condemning him for his relationships with Latin American socialists.

Colombian-Americans are an increasingly powerful part of the nation’s Latino electorate, particularly in states with high Latino populations like Florida. The Obama era saw Colombia welcome a “peace deal” with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Marxist terrorist organization, that then-President Juan Manuel Santos pushed through Congress unconstitutionally after the Colombian people voted against it. The deal granted uncontested congressional seats to the terrorist group, among other concessions. Since the 2016 peace deal, for which Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize, several high-ranking FARC leaders have fled into the jungle and announced a new insurgency against rural civilians.

Trump particularly, and repeatedly, condemned Biden for complimenting Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro — responsible for a regime that regularly kills and tortures dissidents — on his voluminous hair.

“For 47 years, Biden had the chance to help Latin America and he didn’t not give it enough importance because he is a corrupt elitist,” Trump told the newspaper. He later continued, “The problem is that Joe Biden is a diminished and very weak man surrounded by Marxists who can control him because he has always been weak on socialism. Look at his record. It’s embarrassing what he has done.”

Trump condemned Biden for going along with former President Barack Obama’s policies on Cuba, which resulted in windfalls for the Castro regime from technically-legal American tourism and a related rise in state violence against dissidents.

Biden, he said, “gave millions to the Castro in exchange for nothing in a very bad deal with the communist dictatorship in Cuba that I terminated.”

“Biden even complimented Maduro and congratulated him on his hair when he was killing his own people,” Trump noted. “He is a very, very weak man and incredibly corrupt.”

Trump later again recalled the Maduro hair incident.

“Look at what he did in Venezuela,” he said of Biden. “He was very, very weak with [late dictator Hugo] Chávez and Maduro. He even congratulated him on his hair. He was pathetic.”

Biden met with Maduro during the inauguration of socialist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached from office, in 2015. Biden reportedly told Maduro during that meeting, “if I had your hair, I would be president of the United States.” A month later, Maduro claimed that Biden was personally orchestrating a plot to kill him, citing no evidence.

Biden condemned Trump for stating that he would be open to meeting Maduro under the right conditions in June, despite having met Maduro himself already.

“Now that Colombia has a failed socialist state on its border, Biden is the last person that Colombians need in the White House because he has been very weak, inconsistent, and has erred throughout his career,” Trump asserted.

Trump also condemned Biden and the Obama administration for what he described as a cruel policy against illegal immigrants.

“Look at what he did to Hispanics in our country,” Trump said. “He raised their taxes, imprisoned millions with his terrible crime law, and built cages for immigrants. That is something the dishonest fake news doesn’t tell you. Biden built the cages, I built the strongest economy in history for Latinos.”

Trump has experienced significant increases in support from Hispanic voters, according to recent polls, compared to 2016. One poll found that in California, a longtime stronghold for Democrats, one poll found an eight-percent increase in Latino support for Trump between September and October. The Trump campaign has nurtured that increase in support through repeated attacks on Biden for his support from socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and, in Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who ran a failed hard-left presidential campaign against incumbent President Iván Duque in 2018. Trump again mentioned Petro’s support for Biden in the El Tiempo interview.

Biden defended himself from those attacks in responses to his own interview questions from the Colombian newspaper.

“I’m going to be clear: I am not a socialist,” Biden told the newspaper. “And a wide and united coalition of Americans has joined me and my vision for the future of this country, which includes independents, Republican ex-officials, and people appointed by Republican presidents.”

“Trump resorts to lies, disinformation, and invites foreign interference in our elections, all to distract from his failures as president,” Biden asserted.

Biden also called Trump’s Cuba policy “a cheap spectacle” and claimed it was a failure because the Castro family was still in power, not addressing directly the iconic images of Obama standing in front of art honoring communist mass murderer Ernesto “Che” Guevara in Havana or doing the “wave” with Raúl Castro at a baseball game.

“Trump has weakened our democratic institutions, coddled dictators, abandoned or intimidated our democratic allies and, also, severely mistreated migrant populations in the United States,” Biden said.

The protesters chanted slogans like “my body, my choice” – made popular by the pro-abortion movement – and some were seen holding up signs in support of American President Donald Trump, who is facing an election on Tuesday. Some wore protective masks reading “Doria out” in Portuguese and at least one group brought a pixuleco of Doria: a type of inflatable caricature that became popular during the 2016 protests demanding the resignation of socialist President Dilma Rousseff (Rousseff was shortly thereafter impeached).

Doria defied conservative President Jair Bolsonaro and reportedly made an order for 46 million doses of a vaccine candidate by Sinovac, a Chinese pharmaceutical company, last month alongside Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello. The Sinovac candidate is one of several Chinese vaccine experiments and part of a group of dozens of vaccine candidates currently undergoing clinical testing around the world.

Bolsonaro personally intervened, asserting, “the Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig.” Bolsonaro has also opposed calls from the left for the vaccine to be made mandatory, a power that current Brazilian law grants the president. Doria said in mid-October that, if it passes clinical trials, he will make the vaccine mandatory in the state.

Bolsonaro has also staunchly opposed economic lockdowns to prevent the Chinese coronavirus from spreading, claiming they do needless destruction to the economy while not doing enough against the virus to justify the damage. Brazil runs on a federal system, meaning Bolsonaro does not have the power to stop lockdowns; Doria imposed one on Sao Paulo in March.

According to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, about 300 people attended the anti-Doria march on Avenida Paulista, the city’s major thoroughfare, on Sunday. Most appeared to be supporters of Bolsonaro, though the prevailing sentiment was reportedly more against Doria than in Bolsonaro’s favor. The left-wing Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper did describe the crowd as bolsonaristas.

One group of protesters held up a sign apparently referencing Bolsonaro’s message about the vaccine candidate, reading “Doria, I am not a guinea pig.” Others held signs reading “my body belongs to me.” One gentleman brought a large sign reading “Go Trump,” apparently in support of the American president’s re-election bid. In addition to the Brazilian flag, and many Brazilian soccer jerseys, participants waved American and Israeli flags.

“We’re against the authoritarian Chinese ambassador João Doria, who would now make the vaccine compulsory against our wishes,” Andre Petros, a protester, told Reuters. Another protester described the would-be mandatory vaccine, according to Folha, as a “socialist experiment.”

Brazil has documented about 5.5 million cases of Chinese coronavirus. Not counting rogue regimes highly suspected of undercounting cases like China, Russia, and Iran, that makes Brazil home to the third-largest number of diagnosed cases in the world after the United States and India. It has more deaths documented than India, however, at a little more than 160,000 at press time.

Bolsonaro has attracted significant criticism from the left for his opposition to nationwide lockdowns, which extended to personally patronizing businesses and encouraging bystanders to continue engaging in regular commerce. Bolsonaro tested positive for coronavirus in the summer and used the opportunity to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial, to fight the virus. Scientific testing on the potential of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus remains inconclusive at press time.

Bolsonaro has since focused his attention to the issue of vaccine distribution, taking a vocal stance against mandatory vaccinations. As Folha noted, Bolsonaro has called Doria a “lunatic” and “authoritarian” for supporting mandatory coronavirus vaccination and speculated that Doria is seeking to inject people with the vaccine candidate as soon as possible to take credit for the end of the pandemic.

“It is going away, that happened already,” Bolsonaro reportedly said last week, claiming that the pandemic is receding naturally. “I think he [Doria] wants to vaccinate people quickly because it’s going to end and then he’ll say, ‘it ended because of my vaccine.’ What is ending is his government, that’s for sure.”

Bolsonaro has also faced challenges to his rejection of the Chinese vaccine from his own government. In addition to Health Minister Pazuello agreeing to help Doria buy vaccine candidate doses, Vice President Hamilton Mourão said last week, “it’s logical that the government will buy a vaccine developed in China,” prompting yet another statement on Bolsonaro’s part that no member of his government will override his veto.

“The Bic pen is mine,” Bolsonaro said in response to Mourão’s statements to the Brazilian magazine Veja, meaning only he can sign a deal to buy the product.

China is the origin country of the Chinese coronavirus. The Communist Party’s pharmaceutical industry is notoriously unreliable in manufacturing safe vaccines. China has struggled this year to convince its own citizens to take domestic influenza vaccines, largely considered safe and given annually, after a major scandal erupted in 2018 when the government revealed that as many as 1 million children received faulty vaccines, meaning they were not functionally immunized at all. The scandal caused mass protests and violence, including the public beating of a Communist Party official at the hands of angry parents in Jiangsu province last year.

In September, a vaccine factory in China caused thousands of cases of brucellosis, an infectious bacterial disease, by leaking dangerous pathogens into the air in Lanzhou."

Morales Offers Support For Jeremy Corbyn,"Ousted Bolivian President Evo Morales expressed his solidarity with fellow left-winger Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday, as he reacted to the UK Labour party suspending their former leader.

Morales appeared to offer his full-throated support of Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday when he took to social media to offer his solidarity. The Bolivian Marxist, who believes eating too much chicken turns men gay, said that his one-time British counterpart has been “unfairly suspended”.

Affirming his faith in Mr Corbyn, Morales — who was confirmed to have fathered a child with a minor during his time as President — continued: “Jeremy is a political leader and social fighter who defends the just causes in the world.”

Mr Corbyn was suspended from the political party he led until only recently on Thursday, following a damning report on the failings on antisemitism that swirled around his leadership. Mr Corbyn rejected the findings of the report and replied that antisemitism in the Labour party has been “dramatically overstated for political reasons.”

Confirming years of complaints and speculation about the party, last week’s Equality and Human Rights Commission report found that harassment of Jews had taken place, and there had been political interference in dealing with complaints when they were made. The body said of their findings: “The equality body’s analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it.”

Morales and Corbyn have a long history of giving each other political support. When Morales resigned his position in 2019 after an investigation revealed widespread electoral fraud to rig the competition, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn called it a “coup” by the military which went against social justice.

Joe Biden’s younger brother Frank leveraged the Biden name for lucrative deals in Costa Rica and Jamaica, while Hunter used his father’s name to push through a massive deal in Colombia involving a vast Chinese energy corporation.

Costa Rica

In August 2009, a partnership to “reform real estate in Latin America” was announced between Costa Rican agencies and Cygnus International, Frank Biden’s company. The “sustainable” and “socially sensitive” projects for this partnership included the Guanacaste Solar Park, developed in 2014 with another business owned by Frank Biden, and a luxury country club with a top-shelf golf course. The proposal was valued at over $1 billion.

Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís wrote a letter to Frank Biden thanking him for getting involved with the country club project, which included everything from renewable energy deals to waste disposal and a hospital. Solís’s letter said the development would include over 1,000 homes.

The waste-to-energy element is interesting because Solís’s letter referred to a company called Westinghouse-Plasma that Biden seemed reluctant to name, although he frequently alluded to having a “strong waste-to-energy partner.” Joe Biden occasionally praised the company during his vice presidency, literally pitching its services to the Czech Republic in 2009.

Westinghouse-Plasma went through a few ownership changes over the years, but within a year of the thank-you letter President Solís wrote to Frank Biden, the company was purchased in a surprise acquisition by a Delaware-based corporation named Harvest International that is wholly owned by a Chinese company, Sunshine Kaidi New Energy Corp.

A Costa Rican newspaper called El Observador reported that in February 2020, after years of promoting the Guanacaste megaproject, Frank Biden denied through his law firm that he or Joe Biden had ever been involved with it. The project was never completed, and investors reportedly said they never got their money back.

“There is no project in Costa Rica. Never was,” Biden claimed in comments to El Observador – eight years after he said he couldn’t wait to be part of the Guanacaste “community” and boasted that his country club would not have any walls because “most of the amenities are public and it’s the Guanacaste people who have permitted us to be here.”

Frank Biden’s partner in the Guanacaste project, Craig Williamson – named in the 2009 announcement of Biden’s involvement, hailed by Biden as a “business partner and friend” who would help him prove that “protecting the breathtaking beauty that is Costa Rica is a money maker” – was sued for fraud in Costa Rica and currently has an outstanding arrest warrant.

El Observador in February quoted unhappy investors who said they put money into the country club project largely because of the Biden name. Former Costa Rican President Solís said in the same article that he “didn’t ask for resumes” when he met with Biden and his partners.

Frank Biden and Craig Williamson also worked together in Belize, where their real estate partnership ERA Real Estate Costa Rica had interests. In 2007, Biden was named director of development and marketing for a humanitarian nonprofit organization called Hand in Hand Ministries that had significant operations in Belize. The health ministry of Belize, which received a $1.9 million grant in 2011 from a U.S. government program called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), made Hand in Hand Ministries their primary AIDS relief organization.

Jamaica

As vice president in 2014, Joe Biden announced the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI), a program intended to facilitate investment in wind and solar energy projects with U.S. taxpayer subsidies. Biden hosted a major summit for CESI the following year.

Among the projects funded by CESI was a 20-megawatt solar power plant in Jamaica. A $50 million deal to develop the plant was signed in February 2016 by Sun Fund Americas, which is based in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, and is presided over by Frank Biden. The plant officially opened in 2017.

“We have strong partners in both PV Solar and Waste to Energy, and our resort development partner has crafted the best possible development model for green resort and residential communities,” Biden said when announcing the Jamaica deal, vaguely referring once again to a strong waste-to-energy partner.

“From our base in Costa Rica, we are working with several other countries to bring this combined development array in the near term. These countries will benefit from our solutions providing clean energy, and eliminating solid waste, medical waste and water treatment sludge with zero toxic byproduct while creating thousands of jobs locally,” Biden said.

Colombia

Hunter Biden and Joe Biden’s other brother James used the former vice president’s name in 2017 while pushing a deal in Colombia. The investment outline prepared by the Bidens and their partners prominently featured a photo of Joe Biden shaking hands with then-Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and touting the “strong” relationship between them.

The investor Hunter and James Biden was seeking to court for oil investments in Colombia was none other than CEFC China Energy, the shadowy corporation linked to the Chinese Communist government and People’s Liberation Army that figures heavily in the emails recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop. CEFC abruptly went bankrupt in 2018 after its founder Ye Jianming was linked to corruption in Africa and disappeared into the Chinese prison system. The Biden proposal touted Colombia as CEFC’s “gateway to Latin America.”"

The four illegal oil shipments, totaling over a million barrels of petroleum, were bound for Venezuela in defiance of U.S. sanctions.

Sherwin said a “great portion” of the $40 million would be placed into a U.S. fund for the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Iran has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to the victims of terrorism supported or orchestrated by the regime in Tehran, but the regime refuses to make the payments.

Venezuela has enormous oil reserves, but its economy has been comprehensively wrecked by the socialist policies of dictator Nicolás Maduro, who has been reduced to importing fuel from Iran and paying with planeloads of gold. Both Venezuela and Iran are under U.S. sanctions.

The Justice Department also announced on Thursday that it has filed the court paperwork to compel the forfeiture of Iranian missiles seized en route to Yemen, where Iran has been supporting the Houthi insurgency that overthrew the internationally-recognized government in a 2015 coup.

The U.S. Navy confiscated the Iranian shipments of surface-to-air and anti-tank missiles in November 2019 and February 2020 after intercepting vessels in the Arabian Sea that were operating without national flags. The Navy also confiscated enough blasting caps to supply the entire U.S. military for a year.

“The two forfeiture complaints allege sophisticated schemes by the IRGC to secretly ship weapons to Yemen and fuel to Venezuela, countries that pose grave threats to the security and stability of their respective regions,” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Demers said in a statement on Thursday, referring to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the wing of the Iranian military controlled by Iran’s theocracy and a designated terrorist organization.

More specifically, the U.S. said the illicit Iranian shipments were made by the Quds Force, the subversive and destabilizing black-operations unit of the IRGC headed by Brig. Gen. Qassem Soleimani until he was eliminated by a U.S. drone strike in January 2020.

According to Demers, the intercepted shipments to Venezuela and Yemen represent the U.S. government’s “largest-ever civil seizures of fuel and weapons from Iran.”

Demers said he felt “great satisfaction” that much of the money recovered by selling Iran’s illegal oil shipments to Venezuela would be directed to the U.S. Victims of State-Sponsored Terrorism Fund.

Eliott Abrams, the U.S. State Department’s special representative for Iran and Venezuela, said funds from selling the seized Iranian oil “will now go to a far better use than either regime, Iran or Venezuela, could have envisioned because it will provide relief for victims of terrorism rather than the perpetrators of such acts.”"
734,2020-10-30 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/10/30/jair-bolsonaro-condemns-global-renewed-coronavirus-lockdowns-i-dont-understand-it/,Bolsonaro Condemns Global Renewed Coronavirus Lockdowns,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro spent much of the week condemning measures such as widespread lockdowns and mandatory vaccination planned against the Chinese coronavirus. He stated Wednesday morning he did not understand why countries would return to lockdowns and repeated his vow not to import Chinese vaccines the next day.

Bolsonaro has spent much of the latter half of the week on Brazilian airwaves – first on a visit Thursday to Maranhao state and later that day on his regularly scheduled Facebook Live video.

Prior to visiting Maranhao, on Wednesday night, Bolsonaro addressed cases in Europe of a return of strict measures preventing the free movement of people in much of Europe in response to growing numbers of Chinese coronavirus cases. France and Germany imposed formal lockdown measures this week, while Spain and Italy opted for curfews and other measures that restrict trade and deprive citizens of their freedom.

“I just cannot understand measures like that because the virus is there. You’re going to have to confront it,” Bolsonaro, who was diagnosed with the coronavirus in July and has since overcome the infection, said. “You’re wearing a mask, it’s all good, but in a little bit of time none of that will free you of the virus.”

Bolsonaro added that the only service lockdowns provide, in his opinion, is to “mess up the economy.”

“The objective of social isolation – which is wrong, and I said it was wrong from [the beginning] – it only served to mess up the economy and it was supposed to be so that there wasn’t as much contagion and, at the same time, the hospitals weren’t overwhelmed,” he said.

Among the many topics Bolsonaro discussed in his Thursday night Facebook Live video, which lasted nearly an hour, was pandemic policy. He used some of his time to rekindle an ongoing dispute with the left in his country – and, in particular, Sao Paulo Gov. Joao Doria – over the wisdom of importing a vaccine candidate from China.

Doria had joined Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello to announce the purchase of a large shipment of Chinese vaccine candidate doses in October that Bolsonaro canceled, asserting, “The president here is me.” The governor has been at the forefront of calls from the Brazilian left to mandate that Brazilian citizens take a coronavirus vaccine. Doria also imposed strict lockdown measures in his state despite Bolsonaro’s objections; like the United States, Brazil operates as a federalist system in which governors have more power than presidents regarding local policy:

“Nobody is going to take your vaccine by force, ok? Find somebody else,” Bolsonaro said during Thursday’s broadcast, presumably addressing Doria. “And I, who am the government – the money isn’t mine, it’s the people’s – will not buy your vaccine either, no, ok? Find somebody else to pay for your vaccine.”

Despite Bolsonaro’s opposition to the Chinese-made vaccine – and opening his Thursday night broadcast with a call to eradicate communism from Brazil – Bolsonaro has proven a lucrative friend for Chinese communist dictator Xi Jinping. Bolsonaro visited Beijing last year to sign eight trade agreements between the two governments. Since then, Brazilian companies have signed major deals with Chinese counterparts in industries such as mining and agriculture. Brazil recently became the third-largest oil exporter to China in the world.

“It may sound racist to differentiate development based on culture. But after living in Brazil for a while, you will find out the answer. … Brazilians are not willing to be as diligent and hard-working as the Chinese,” the Chinese government publication Global Times declared in an article published in 2018. “Neither do they value savings for the next generation, like the Chinese do. Yet they demand the same welfare and benefits as those in developed countries.”

Despite Bolsonaro’s rejection of lockdown measures and other policies that freeze economic activity, Brazil experienced a dramatic rise in unemployment and a fall in economic activity since the coronavirus outbreak struck in March – largely because governors such as Doria have the power to impose the measures despite Bolsonaro’s opposition. Brazil’s unemployment rate from June to August rose to 14.4 percent, or 13.8 million people, the highest number since 2012. From June to August 2019, that number was 11.8 percent. Economists noted that the unemployment rate rose in part due to the fact that by the end of that period, restrictions had begun to lift, so more people began actively looking for work, rather than dropping out of the workforce entirely.

Brazil has documented about 5.5 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, as of Friday. Of these, 158,959 have died. The nation has a higher death toll, officially, than any country except the United States, and only America and India exceed its number of cases. These numbers only take into account the official tallies recorded by sovereign states, however, which includes several counts from rogue states that experts consider, at best, dubious. North Korea, for example, claims to have documented zero coronavirus cases on its soil despite bordering China, the virus’s origin country, and Russia, which has a high number of cases. China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have all stood accused of documenting fraudulent cases and death counts.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said it was “startling” that a former operative of the Venezuelan government is employed at Facebook, in a comment to Breitbart News.

Earlier this week, Breitbart News reported that a former longtime operative of the Venezuelan government, who built a website to help propagandize for the socialist regime, is employed at Facebook.

The employee, Martin Sanchez, spoke at Trotskyist conferences in the U.S. prior to joining the tech giant.

“The fact that a Venezuelan socialist leads a key content classification team at Facebook should be startling to all who value our First Amendment rights,” said Sen. Blackburn in a comment to Breitbart News.

“People bring their personal experiences to work with them, and Sanchez spent much of his career advocating for ideals that are at odds with those of the United States. The American people have seen the devastation that was brought upon Venezuela by socialist policies, and do not want to see the U.S. face the same fate.”

Facebook did not respond to Breitbart’s request for comment on Sanchez, including a question about whether Sanchez is allowed any influence over decisions related to content that could impact U.S. elections.

Sanchez got his start in tech when he co-founded the website Aporrea.org, a pro-Chavez site, in 2002.

Venezuelan writer and Breitbart News contributor Christian K. Caruzo describes Aporrea as “one of the first, if not the first pro-Chavez website… Ground zero for Chavista stuff online. This was back before Facebook, Twitter.”

Despite alleged concerns about “foreign interference” related to U.S. elections on Facebook, the mainstream corporate media has paid scant attention to Sanchez’s presence at Facebook.

Bolsonaro has risen to become the most prominent head of state campaigning against Christophobia, or the persecution of Christians due to their faith. In his remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in September, he warned of growing Christophobia around the world and urged the U.N. to act to protect Christian groups. At the same assembly, the prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, demanded the U.N. enforce a global ban on anti-Islamic blasphemy.

While Bolsonaro himself is Christian, Christianity is not the state religion of Brazil. He has, however, been significantly more vocal against Christian persecution than the leaders of officially Christian states like Vatican City, Argentina, or Greece.

“She was there praying, this guy who detests Christians comes in,” Bolsonaro said during his broadcast, a regular Facebook live talk on Thursday night, referring to Barreto’s final moments. “We’re talking about Christophobia.”

“He stabbed this lady in there. We mourn the deaths of the three people,” he continued.

The killings occurred in the Basilica of Notre Dame of Nice, where Barreto, age 44, was praying when the suspect came in and stabbed multiple people. French media sources have identified the killer as a Tunisian immigrant named Brahim Aouissaoui. Subsequent reports indicated that the suspect may have had an accomplice. Police said he repeatedly shouted the slogan “allahu akbar,” which roughly translated to “Allah is superior to all,” while he attacked his victims. Jihadists often use this slogan while killing to cement the intention of their actions.

Barreto died trying to run into a neighboring restaurant, French police said, in an attempt to flee the church during the stabbing. Her last words were reportedly, “tell my family that I love them.”

Barreto, a native of the suburbs of Salvador, Brazil, lived in France and had three children. She was a French citizen and was working as a caretaker for the elderly, the Brazilian outlet Terça Livre reported, though she was also a trained cook.

The jihadist killed two others in the attack: an older woman praying at the church, who was “almost beheaded,” and a man identified as “Vincent,” who worked at the basilica.

“The Brazilian Government deplores and vehemently condemns the atrocious attack that took place today inside the Basilica of Notre Dame of Nice, in France, where a terrorist murdered three people,” Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, said in an official statement.

“The Brazilian Government informs, with great regret, that one of the victims killed was a 44-year-old Brazilian woman, mother of three, residing in France,” the statement continued. “President Jair Bolsonaro, on behalf of the entire Brazilian nation, expresses his deep condolences to the family and friends of the citizen murdered in Nice, as well as to those of the other victims, and extends his solidarity to the French people and government.”

“At this moment, the Brazilian Government expresses in particular its solidarity with Christians and people of other denominations who suffer persecution and violence due to their belief,” the statement concluded.

France is currently in the midst of a wave of jihadist violence following the beheading of Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher, on October 16. Paty had used cartoons from the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to teach a class on free speech – some of which featured haram depictions of Muhammad – prompting a grassroots campaign among Muslim parents to kill him. The killer in his case was identified as a teen from the Muslim Russian region of Chechnya.

French Police Swoop on 80+ Extremists Who Expressed Support for Paris Beheader https://t.co/V8Ch9AixIH — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2020

In response to the beheading, French President Emmanuel Macron award Paty the Legion of Honor, France’s highest award for civilians, posthumously, and asserted to the Muslim world, “we will never give up cartoons.” In solidarity, some French cities projected Charlie Hebdo cartoons on the sides of buildings in defiance. The magazine itself suffered a jihadist massacre in 2015 in response to refusing to stop printing its cartoons.

Macron’s response triggered condemnation of his dedication to free speech – not of the beheading – from the leaders of nations like Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran. Muslim protests have occurred in Bangladesh and India as well as the aforementioned countries calling for a boycott of France. France itself fielded at least five attempted jihadist attacks on Thursday, a Muslim holiday observing Muhammad’s birthday.

Bolsonaro has become one of the world’s leading voices against the persecution of Christians.

“Liberty is humankind’s greatest asset. I call upon the entire international community to protect religious liberty and fight against Christophobia,” the Brazilian president told the United Nations last month. “Peace cannot possibly be disassociated from security. Cooperation among people cannot possibly be disassociated from freedom. … Brazil is a Christian and conservative country and has family as its foundation.”

737,2020-10-29 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/10/29/maduro-venezuela-less-three-weeks-left-gasoline-supply/,Maduro: Venezuela Has Less than Three Weeks’ Left of Gasoline Supply,"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro claimed on Wednesday that his country had just under three weeks’ worth of gasoline left, blaming the shortages on a supposed terrorist attack against an oil refinery in Falcón state.

“Venezuela at this moment only has gasoline reserves for the next 20 days,” Maduro said during a press conference. “We have managed to accumulate some and are hoping to extend this to 30 days. These gasoline reserves have been achieved as a result of the fact that we are producing 30 more than the country’s consumption and that gasoline imports have arrived from various regions.”

According to Maduro, the shortage of fuel was the result of a “terrorist attack” at the Amuay refinery in Falcón state after there was an explosion at the facility on Tuesday afternoon.

“Yesterday, the Amuay refinery was attacked with a powerful weapon,” he declared. “They wanted to cause total destruction of the refinery. They demolished a tower with a level of thickness in its steel superior to a war tank.”

Maduro did not present any evidence for his claim or further description of the alleged “weapon.” He also did not accuse anyone of staging the alleged terrorist attack. Maduro typically blames most ills in his country on the Trump administration and the United States, which have led efforts to remove his regime from power by imposing severe economic sanctions on the country’s oil industry.

National Assembly member Luis Stefanelli Barjacoba contended that the incident was most likely caused by a “hydrofluoric acid leak.” He also accused the state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) of an “irresponsible attitude in failing to contest Maduro’s questionable version of events.”

PELIGRO Amuay vuelve a ser escenario de alerta máxima, con la actitud irresponsable de PDVSA que ha mantenido cosetudinariamente desde la tragedia de Amuay…abro hilo pic.twitter.com/XpCT97vV8m — Luis Stefanelli (@LuisStefanelli) October 28, 2020

“We are returning to normal from a very hard blow,” Maduro claimed. “The United States has for a year tried to block the gasoline that we are importing. Even in August, they stole three million barrels from us at sea, with the help of [opposition leader] Juan Guaidó.”

Even as Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian situation reached dire proportions in recent years, most people could access gasoline practically for free as part of the socialist regime’s gas subsidies first introduced under Hugo Chávez. Despite having the largest oil reserves in the world, oil production has plummeted in recent years as employees resigned en masse from PDSVA. Replaced by socialist cronies with little functional engineering experience, PDVSA’s oil refineries have fallen into such decay as to render them largely inoperable.

As a result, the crisis-stricken country has for the past two years experienced chronic shortages and removal of subsidies that have made gasoline unaffordable for most people. Those who can afford it are often forced to wait for hours or even days in queues as motorists desperately try to access what has become the most precious of resources.

Should Venezuela run out of gasoline entirely, this would likely lead to the most severe situation ever experienced there, as there would be no available transportation for people, food, medical supplies, and just about every other living essential. Even with access to gasoline, the average Venezuelan is now living off just a few dollars a month and remains unable to provide sufficient food, shelter, and basic living standards for their family.

738,2020-10-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/10/28/brazil-becomes-chinas-third-largest-oil-provider/,Brazil Becomes Third-Largest Provider of Oil to China,"September saw Brazil become the third-largest provider of oil to communist China for 2020 so far, according to data the Chinese Customs Administration revealed this week.

The data show total exports from Brazil to China last month were 4.49 million tonnes, equivalent to an average of 1.1 million barrels per day (BPD). This is a more than 30-percent increase compared with September 2019, when the figure was around 2.96 million tonnes and 723,000 BPD.

The total exports from January to September this year amounted to 33.69 million, equivalent to around 915,000 BPD. This is a 15.6-percent increase against the same period last year, despite the fact that this year both countries have faced lockdowns as a preventative measure against the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

The rise in shipments means that China now represents more than 70 percent of Brazil’s total oil exports, which remain a vital part of the country’s economy.

Reuters reported in May that executives at Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras remained bullish about the future at the time and saw no need for cuts in oil production, despite a fall in global demand, largely because the demand in the Chinese market remained robust while domestic consumption is beginning to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Growing exports to China are in part the result of the company’s close relationship with independent refineries in China’s Shandong Province, which have become one of Petrobras’s leading customers. This also comes at a time when American oil firms, including Chevron, have cut back their production in response to falling demand.

“Our commercial team has been developing a long-term relationship with Shandong refineries in China where our oil has strong demand even during the crisis,” Petrobas Chief Logistics Officer André Barreto Chiarini said during an investors call, the news agency reported. “Crude oil from the Lula, Iracema, Sapinhoa, and Buzios fields have the same overall characteristics as specific Chinese oils … that are experiencing declining production.”

The move towards Latin American imports also comes as China faces pressure to move away from importing Iranian oil to avoid U.S. economic sanctions, which have already been imposed on various Chinese companies caught violating them. In the quarter of 2020, Iranian exports to China fell by a massive 52 percent, with that figure likely to continue falling unless sanctions relief is provided.

Despite campaigning on a hardline anti-China platform similar to President Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has seemingly embraced a warm relationship with Beijing since assuming office at the beginning of 2019. Last year, Bolsonaro signed eight separate trade agreements with the communist state and declared that Brazil “needs China” and that the two countries were “completely aligned, in a way that reaches beyond our commercial and business relationship.”

739,2020-10-28 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/10/28/cuba-claims-be-testing-two-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates/,Cuba Claims to Be Testing Two Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates,"The Communist Party of Cuba announced on Tuesday that it had registered the second of two vaccine candidates against the Chinese coronavirus, which would begin its first round of trials “soon” — Havana promised results on the vaccine studies by January 2021.

Cuba is home to one of the world’s most deteriorated healthcare systems after decades of communist rule and heavy investment in its slave doctor system, which rakes in for the regime an estimated $11 billion a year. Cuban officials admitted last year to an increasingly alarming shortage on the island of basic drugs, long before the Chinese coronavirus pandemic swept the world.

The two vaccines, dubbed Soberana [“sovereign”] 01 and Soberana 02, are the latest attempt by the Castro regime to inject itself into the global race to end the pandemic. Cuba’s second-in-command, Miguel Díaz-Canel, claimed at the debut of the first vaccine candidate that its name “evokes the feelings of patriotism and revolutionary and humanistic commitment with which it has been worked on, and also the commitment to the foundational, and when we talk about foundational, we are talking about the Commander-in-Chief [Fidel Castro].”

Cuban government agents, along with allies in socialist dictatorships like Venezuela, have also promoted the use of interferons — anti-viral proteins — to treat the virus, despite no evidence in the free world that the treatment works and warnings from legitimate doctors that improper use of interferons could kill patients.

The Russian news agency TASS revealed on Tuesday that Cuba had announced the launch of Soberana 02. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, teased the vaccine candidate last week, claiming it was “unprecedented among all of those being developed to face [Chinese coronavirus] around the world.”

Vicente Vérez Bencomo, the director-general of the Finlay Vaccine Institute in Cuba, told the state propaganda outlet that Soberana 02 would work as a “conjugate vaccine,” a type of immunization mechanism most commonly used against bacterial infectious disease.

“The conjugate vaccines currently know[n] have two distinctive properties: they induce long-term immunity and the antibodies generated not only protect against disease, but they block bacteria from colonizing the oropharynx of the vaccinated,” Vérez said. The doctor added that he expects “similar” results against the Chinese coronavirus despite the fact that it is not a bacterium.

Vérez added at the time that initial trials on Soberana 01 were a success and that patients receiving the vaccine candidate had “very few side effects, all of them light,” calling into question the need for Soberana 02. The initial vaccine remains in Phase One clinical study.

In August, Vérez claimed that he personally received Soberana 01 as part of its study, as well as two other members of the Finlay institute.

The Castro regime occasionally declares itself the source of a miracle vaccine; last year, it claimed to have produced a vaccine against lung cancer. Yet, it imports many doses of basic vaccines necessary to maintain a functional healthcare system, sometimes raising health concerns at home. Last year, Cuban doctors killed a one-year-old girl, Paloma Domínguez Caballero, by giving her a standard Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine at her 12-month well visit. Shortly after her death, reports revealed that Cuba was importing its MMR vaccines from an Indian company linked to the deaths of three children via faulty vaccines in Cuba in 2002. The Castro regime did not, apparently, change sourcing for vaccines after the deaths.

At the time of Domínguez’s death, reports from Cuba suggested that several other children — the number varied in reports from four to eight — also experienced extreme adverse effects from the MMR vaccine offered at the same clinic where staffers killed Domínguez. After Domínguez’s mother began using social media to attract attention to her case with success, the Communist Party attempted to intimidate her into silence, resulting in both of the child’s parents fleeing the country just a month later. Cuban authorities did not update on the status of the other children, nor did any other parents surface with complaints.

Regarding the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in particular, doctors have warned that the Communist Party’s claims that interferons cure coronavirus may seriously hurt patients.

“When the Government of Cuba assures that the Interferon developed in Cuba cures the coronavirus, it is committing a serious crime against world public health, since this drug not only lacks any scientific proof, but also where it has been tested has already given null results of encouragement,” a group of doctors said in a letter published by the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders in April.

“Cuba should receive a formal warning from the authorities of the World Health Organization for publicizing a media hoax about which there is no evidence, but quite the contrary, and whose consequences may be harmful to the lives of thousands of patients worldwide,” the doctors concluded.

Cuba’s alleged vaccine candidate is competing with 43 other vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials and dozens of others identified as being in a “pre-clinical” stage, according to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) master list. China dominates the list of vaccine candidates, though the list includes a variety of other nations such as the United States, Japan, Germany, and Kazakhstan.

The groups often consisted of families: grandparents, parents, and children – a testament to how the cause of the liberation of Cuba has been transmitted inter-generationally for over six decades. Before the afternoon ended, an unprecedentedly massive 30,000-car caravan would take place, driving out of the parking lot at 10 a.m. and finding its way into national headlines and the history of Miami.

By 9 a.m., half an hour before the event was slated to begin, the assigned parking lots were overflowing. The organizers had printed cardboards with numbers on them, from one to 1,000. They sought to carefully number the participants so as to preempt disputes on total participation by the media. The 1,000 cardboards were almost gone by 8:50 a.m.

Greeting the vehicles coming in were gray-polo-wearing teenage volunteers belonging to Students for a Free Cuba, grandchildren and children of Cuban exiles. These kids have grown up as witnesses to the harrowing personal accounts from their families about how Cuba, Nicaragua, and then Venezuela were lost to socialist-communist totalitarianism. The idea of addressing the continued dire human rights situation on the island has motivated them to organize. The grassroots mobilization for the anti-communist caravan inspired them to volunteer for the event.

Car number 19 was driven by José Antonio Rodríguez Sosa. As a young navy cadet in Cuba in 1959, he witnessed up close the Communist takeover of the prestigious Mariel national naval academy where he studied. It became clear to him that the new Communist overlords were reshaping the armed forces into an ideological instrument and not as an institution of the republic. He vowed to resist and spent the next ten years of his life at the helm of rebel ships supported by the CIA, which raided military objectives along the coast and brought in men and supplies to aid the internal underground.

Castro’s imposition of communism initiated a long and bloody civil war waged in the cities, hills, and coasts of the island. Many of its survivors are in exile and their commitment has not waned. The end of CIA support did not mean the end of José Antonio’s efforts and the rest of his life has been dramatically marked by his commitment to the struggle for Cuban freedom. He agreed that October 10, 2020, the anniversary of the start of Cuba’s first war of independence against Spain, was a fitting day to make a statement. He and other veterans of the Cuban freedom struggle joined the caravan.

One of the main exile organizations coordinating the event was precisely the Bay of Pigs veterans of Brigade 2506 led by its president, retired U.S. Colonel and Vietnam veteran Johnny López de la Cruz. Their vow to liberate Cuba, taken when they were as young as the Students for a Free Cuba high school volunteers are now, remains as firm as ever. For the first time in many years, they not only carry that conviction but also have hope.

Many of the participants in the Caravan brought Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan flags. Also to be seen were Puerto Rican and Colombian flags, as well as the rainbow flag of the LGBTQ movement – a very formally and informally organized community from the grassroots up, mobilized organically that day.

There was a great outpouring of both young Cuban recent arrivals and the new generation of Cuban-Americans. A great majority of vehicles had Trump signs and banners. Although the caravan was assembled on a nonpartisan basis, participants were free to bring the symbols they chose. For thousands who turned out that day, Trump’s relentlessly consistent policies of enforcing political and financial sanctions on the Cuban communist regime and its allies in Venezuela and Nicaragua has signified that the current administration seeks true change on the island.

Cuban exiles know communism well. They know its structure and the indoctrination of its militants. They know how it tried to destroy the basic nucleus of Cuban culture: the family. They lived through its persecution and undermining of spiritual faith. They know of its unquenchable, brutal thirst for power over the innermost sanctum of the human person and its multiple methods of thought control.

They know of the concentration camps set up to stamp out social plurality. How a broad range of people, from Jehovah’s Witnesses to artists to homosexuals were herded into those camps to be “re-educated” according to Castro and Ernesto “Che” Guevara’s vision of what a “revolutionary man” should be.

They know how communism mutates, shifting shapes in a chameleon-like fashion to always offer what people seek in desperate situations to lure them into the totalitarian trap. The hammer and sickle symbols and hateful violence against public institutions that raged this summer in the U.S. had all of the call signs that exiles recognize. They’ve seen them before, as well as heard the neo-Marxist babble of so-called educators, entertainers, and politicians seep progressively into the mainstream. Their powerful life experiences do not allow for confusion. Be it in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Maoist China, Castroite Cuba, or the Venezuela of Chávez and Maduro, socialism always brings the same results.

As the caravan proceeded, local radio station La Poderosa 670 AM not only broadcast the event live, but also held a seminar on communism and socialism where leading academic experts on the matter from throughout the hemisphere analyzed and discussed the issue in a thorough way.

Cuban culture is very much about individual freedom and achievement and, therefore, like the American, deeply egalitarian. But equality, equal dignity under God as should be reflected in law, does not mean the artificial sameness imposed by socialism and communism to achieve population control. Individuality signifies plurality.

A free people respects itself and extends that respect to others. The first thing the farmers and landowners who rose up against Spain on October 10, 1868, did was free the slaves and invite them to join the Army of Liberation. The freed slaves eventually became leaders of the new government and army and the sons and grandsons of the farmers and landowners fought and often died under their command. That powerful, active memory of freedom remains in the Cuban psyche. Hence, by the thousands, they have resisted communism in the island or fled it. Both firing squad walls and oceans depths are full of corpses that testify to Cubans’ love for freedom.

October 10 is also the birthday of Jorge Luis García Pérez “Antúnez,” who spent 17 years as a political prisoner in Cuba and is often referred to as “the Cuban Mandela.” He grew up under communism but his own, innate thirst for truth and liberty led him to question the regime and attempt to change it through civil resistance inside the prisons and on the streets. The main speaker at the rally, he was visibly moved by the outpouring of support for the cause that day.

For decades, exiles have seen how their message of freedom for Cuba is either distorted or ignored by many in mainstream media and Hollywood. Poll after phony poll, decade after decade, has decreed the end of the Cuban exile freedom movement. Pundits spewing ideological lines have rambled on about how young Cubans, turning away from their parents, seek to engage and open up to Castroism. These lies have not weakened the community for, in exile, Cubans comprise a young nation with deep truths.

As in 1868, they still deeply believe in individual freedom, in the right to private property, in the right to life, in the rule of law. They deeply love America because it has institutionally enshrined these values and thereby made possible the opportunity to prosper, to be self-reliant, to be free. As a free people, they hold loyalty as a value and are deeply loyal to America.

As with authoritarian colonial Spanish rule, Cubans have rationally sought to recover these freedoms under communism. Repression was the response of the corrupt military governors in the 19th century and, in a much more systematic and cruel way, repression is the response of the current Marxist overlords. That repression has been exported to countries such as Venezuela and Nicaragua. Cubans know that the Marxist oligarchs must be pushed out of power for, if not, Cuba will continue to spiral into decay and despair, and the ideological disease will further uncontrollably spread beyond Cuba’s borders.

Ours has been a lonely, decades-long fight to proclaim this truth. We have not faltered, and have grown in strength from it.

“This is the mother of all caravans,” proclaimed a sign carried by Reynol Rodríguez, one of the key organizers of the event, as he walked in the casino parking lot. Of few words, very tall and still strong, he is now almost 80. He was a minor when he began to fight in the ranks of the Student Directorate for political freedom against the Batista regime, and did not hesitate to continue that fight when Castro installed a communist dictatorship. Over many decades he constantly risked his life and put his family through much sacrifice in that struggle.

He looked around at the turnout, and at the many young people sitting in their cars, surrounding him. “We will be free,” he said under his breath to one of his sons next to him, and held his sign higher.

Bolsonaro said he would meet with his health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, to handle the legal process around distributing vaccines, objecting that the matter of vaccination had been “judicialized” and that vaccines “are not a matter of justice, but a matter of health above all. A judge cannot decide if you are going to get a vaccine or not, that doesn’t exist.”

Bolsonaro made the remarks amid growing pressure to his left for his administration to import dubious vaccine candidates from rogue states like Russia and China. The governor of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria — a Bolsonaro rival — ordered the importing of Chinese vaccine candidates made by the firm Sinovac this month, prompting Bolsonaro to interject and cancel the orders. Bolsonaro affirmed that, so long as he is president, Brazil will not administer experimental Chinese vaccine candidates.

Bolsonaro’s comments on Monday echoed sentiments shared over the weekend, following his declarations on the Sinovac vaccine candidate specifically. Bolsonaro posted a message to his followers on social media Sunday reading, “Good night to all. Here, vaccines are only mandatory for Faisca.” The accompanying photo revealed that Faisca is a dog; faisca is the Portuguese word for “bolt.”

– Boa noite a todos.

Brazilian law does allow the government to impose vaccinations. According to O Globo, Brazil’s Ministry of Health has mandated a specific vaccine schedule for all citizens from birth since 1973. That schedule lists vaccines that are common around the world and have been proven safe for decades, however, not experimental candidates like those currently in development for the Chinese coronavirus.

The newspaper noted also that Bolsonaro’s executive order on the Chinese coronavirus, signed in February, allows for mandatory vaccinations. It does not require Bolsonaro to mandate them, but gives him the power to do so if he chooses.

The debate over vaccines indicates that Bolsonaro is not keen to use that power, particularly in light of his very public disagreements with Doria, the governor of Sao Paulo. While Bolsonaro is allowing American pharmaceutical companies to conduct testing in Brazil, he adamantly rejected news of the Chinese vaccine candidate coming to the country after news reports revealed that Doria and Pazuello, the health minister, had agreed on a plan to buy 46 million doses of the Chinese vaccine candidate. Bolsonaro canceled the shipment, stating in a social media post, “the Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig.”

Doria insisted again on Monday that the Chinese vaccine candidate was on its way despite the president’s objections.

In response to Bolsonaro’s intervention, Brazil’s Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), its top court, has also weighed in. The STF, run by judges appointed by prior socialist presidents, was the first to use the word “judicialization” to describe the process of vaccinating Brazilians.

STF President Luis Fux reportedly said that the process of vaccinating should go through a “judicialization” but implied that Brazil had time to figure it out.

“We want to find a solution for this case,” Fux said last week. “Based on what everything indicates, everyone says the vaccine that took the least time [to be developed] until now took four years. I don’t see why we should get ahead of it.”

Brazilian media reported on Tuesday that the STF may be considering an intermediary measure, one that does not criminalize rejecting a coronavirus vaccine but restricts the freedoms of those who opt against it. Citing anonymous court sources, O Globo reported that some suggestions on the table include making vaccines mandatory to travel out of state or allowing businesses to require vaccines for customers in places like bars and restaurants.

A poll released Tuesday found high rates of Brazilians interested in taking the vaccine that dwindled significantly when they were told the vaccine was of Chinese or Russian origin. According to the Research Center for Political Communication and Public Health at the University of Brasília, 78.1 percent of respondents said they had a “high” or “some” chance of taking the vaccine if asked only if they were interested in a coronavirus vaccine. O Globo noted that the study found the number dropping by 16.4 percent if told the vaccine is Chinese; 14.1 percent fewer people said they had some or a high chance of taking it if it was identified as Russian.

The number of people answering affirmatively to the question rose 7.9 percent when told the vaccine was American. A similar increase, 7.4 percent, occurred when told the vaccine was British.

The poll also found that supporters of the Bolsonaro administration were much more likely not to accept a Chinese vaccine.

Brazil has one of the highest rates of coronavirus infection compared to other free states (rogue states like China and Russia have documented low rates that experts have questioned). At press time, Brazil has confirmed 5.4 million cases of coronavirus and 157,397 deaths attributed to the disease.

In an interview with Variety ahead of next week’s all-important election, Martin touted Biden’s decades in high-level politics as a reason to vote for him.

“I’ve been supporting Biden forever,” he said. “I think he is the only option we have and he is great and he has been in politics all his life. This is the moment. We all need to get together and be loud about the course of this nation.”

Watch below:

The 48-year-old also attempted to portray himself as a victim within Trump’s America because he and his family belong to certain minority groups.

“I am a Latino, gay [and] married to an Arab living in Trump’s America,” he said. “We check all the boxes.”

Discussing Latino support for Trump, which is especially strong in Florida where he resides, Martin described such differences of opinion among the Hispanic community as “really scary.”

“It is super sad,” he admitted. “Trumpeters make a lot of noise. And it’s scary to see their enthusiasm but us, we’re doing what’s right, the right way and we’ll see what happens in November. I’m very optimistic.”

The singer also attempted to play down the significance of the decision of Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez to endorse Trump over Biden. “Who is that? Next,” he said. “She doesn’t exist. She wasn’t even elected by the people. She’s not part of this conversation.”

Last month, Martin joined actress Eva Longoria and singer Luis Fonsi for a Biden event in Florida aimed at courting the Hispanic vote. During the event, Biden attempted to impress the audience by playing Fonsi’s hit song “Despacito” on his phone. However, various polls indicate that the 77-year-old is struggling among Latino voters, with Trump holding a small but noticeable lead according to current voting intentions.

Breitbart News recently published a conversation between international news editor Frances Martel and investigative reporter Ildefonso Ortiz on the Hispanic vote and the values of the Democratic Party conflicting with Latino Americans.

“Our culture and Hispanic values do not align with progressivism, with the far left, and you see that in the fact that family is everything for Hispanics,” Martel said in a conversation with Breitbart News border reporter Ildefonso Ortiz. “We are a people of large families, big holiday parties.. we are very catholic, deeply religious… wherever we go we are working, we open businesses, we have an ambition to improve ourselves.

Lawmakers announced they will also proceed to begin a legal process against conservative President Jeanine Áñéz, who oversaw the electoral process, for alleged genocide and violation of the constitution.

On Monday, the socialist government under President Luis Arce announced that the legal system would drop charges against Morales, who remains in exile in Argentina. These charges included a variety of crimes against humanity, including planning acts of terrorism and attempting to starve parts of the country’s population. The Áñez government had also opened an investigation against Morales for allegedly engaging in acts of pedophilia after authorities found a birth certificate for a child born to a minor that identified Morales as the father.

The Bolivian legal system will also reportedly drop charges against other members of Morales’s Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, including former Solicitor General Héctor Arce (no relation).

The new leftist regime has confirmed that it will pursue charges of constitutional violations against Áñéz, who filled the power vacuum last year following Morales’ resignation amid reports of irregularities and voter fraud in the 2019 presidential election. Áñez, a conservative senator, became president after everyone above her on the chain of command fled the country with Morales.

The accusations against Áñez are related to the use of force against violent leftists in the districts of Sacaba (Cochacabama) and Senkata (La Paz) following Áñez’s inauguration last year, as well as the imposition of Supreme Decree 4078, which temporarily exempted military and police officials from prosecution.

“There are two trials of responsibilities, one for the signing of Supreme Decree 4078, with the classification of resolutions contrary to the Constitution and breach of office,” Victor Borda, the president of the socialist-controlled Mixed Constitutional Commission of the Legislative Assembly, told Página Siete. “The other is for the massacres of Senkata and Sacaba, for crimes of genocide and murder, among others.”

Responding to the charges, Áñéz accused the MAS of persecuting its political opponents.

“The MAS recovers its habit of prosecuting those who think differently. That is why we must remind them that democracy is not only the rule of the majority,” she wrote on Twitter. “Furthermore, it is the government that must adjust to the law and it is the government that must respect freedom.”

El MAS recupera su costumbre de enjuiciar a los que piensan distinto. Por eso hay que recordarle que la democracia no sólo es el gobierno de la mayoría. Además, es el gobierno ajustado a ley y es el gobierno que respeta la libertad. — Jeanine Añez Chavez (@JeanineAnez) October 26, 2020

Since Arce’s electoral win last week, where he received approximately 55 percent of the vote – enough to avoid a second-round run-off – demonstrations have taken place around Bolivia amid fears that the country will once again slide into the kind of authoritarianism Morales practiced alongside other left-wing Latin American regimes.

Many protesters claim that this month’s election was fraudulent. Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Acre on his victory in what he described as a “credible [electoral] process.”

744,2020-10-26 00:00:00,http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/10/26/venezuelas-maduro-everybody-in-the-united-states-thinks-trump-faked-coronavirus/,Venezuela’s Maduro: ‘Everybody in the United States’ Thinks Trump Faked Coronavirus,"Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro questioned President Donald Trump’s Chinese coronavirus diagnosis during his regular television program on Sunday, claiming Trump used the disease as a “campaign strategy” to “victimize himself” and gain sympathy.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Chinese coronavirus in early October, prompting some time in isolation to recover. Trump has since tested negative, according to his doctors, and returned to the campaign trail.

In his remarks Sunday, Maduro said that he was not alone in doubting that Trump had lied about contracting the disease: “In the United States, everybody doubts it.”

Elsewhere in the broadcast, Maduro claimed his socialist regime had developed a “100 percent” effective treatment for the coronavirus, a reiteration of his assertions that Venezuelan “miracle droplets” and “rectal ozone therapy” were saving people in his country from dying of the disease. No credible international health agency has approved of Maduro’s alleged cures.

Maduro made his remarks in a beachside edition of his In Contact with Maduro program while condemning the “civilized” West for a small spike in coronavirus cases in the past month:

#EnVivo 📹 | Jornada de balance de la aplicación del método 7+7 Plus, en el marco de la lucha contra el Covid-19.https://t.co/n5Q3k1L9De — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) October 25, 2020

“Donald Trump doesn’t wear a mask,” Maduro asserted:

We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktN — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2020

“Donald Trump allegedly had coronavirus – allegedly,” Maduro emphasized. “Today, I doubt it, in the United States everybody doubts it, it looked like a campaign strategy to victimize himself.”

Maduro claimed the evidence of Trump lying to the world about a coronavirus diagnosis was that he was not wearing a mask when he first appeared in public after testing negative for the virus. Doctors do not consider people who test negative after being diagnosed, therefore defeating the infection, contagious in the immediate aftermath of the disease.

The dictator’s declaration on Sunday differed significantly from his initial reaction to the news of Trump’s infection.

“We send our human solidarity. We hope he recovers his health and his life,” Maduro said at the time, hoping that the virus would lead Trump to “be more reflexive and more human for the protection of the people of the U.S.”

In addition to condemning Trump, Maduro condemned the global public health community for ignoring the alleged success of Maduro’s bizarre quarantine strategy, dubbed “7+7.” The Venezuelan regime is imposing week-long total lockdowns nationwide to prevent the spread of the virus, followed by one week of freedom.

“If Reuters, AFP, EFE, told their countries what Venezuela is doing, perhaps they could take some lessons from us Venezuelans about how to combine quarantine and care with flexibility,” Maduro said.

Maduro also used his time on national television Sunday to announce that Venezuela was pursuing the approval of a “cure” for the Chinese coronavirus. Venezuela, he said, had “acquired a medicine that 100 percent cures the coronavirus” and that Caracas would soon put the alleged cure at the disposal of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).

“The study has been verified by experts and scientists and in the next few days we will proceed to construct a route so that, through the W.H.O., we can ratify the results,” Maduro said.

Maduro identified the “cure” as a “TR-10 molecule” that was “totally isolated and previously confronted with the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” which “resulted in the 100 percent annihilation of the virus.”

This “cure” appears to be different from three other alleged treatments for coronavirus patients that Maduro has promoted on his television program. Last week, Maduro announced his regime was using “miracle droplets” attributed to José Gregorio Hernández, a beatified Venezuelan doctor from the early 1900s, to cure the coronavirus, as well as “rectal ozone therapy.” The ozone therapy, according to Maduro, has a 96-percent success rate.

Maduro repeated his endorsement of ozone therapy this weekend, vowing on his television program that every “popular clinic” in the country would soon have access to the treatment.

According to the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ozone is “a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy.”

“Venezuela is almost ready, we just need the results of the molecular investigations because we have an antiviral that is going to be a slam dunk against the coronavirus, made by Venezuelan minds, with Venezuelan wisdom and science,” Maduro promised.

In March, Maduro claimed that Venezuela would have access to yet another unproven and potentially dangerous “cure”: interferons manufactured in Cuba. Interferons are proteins that often surface in animals with viral infections. A group of doctors alongside the human rights NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders condemned Havana’s communist regime in April for promoting its alleged interferon cure, stating the treatment could “kill, rather than cure” coronavirus patients and that its promotion was a “serious crime against world public health.”

“Cuba is at the head, at the vanguard — Cuba, always Cuba, is at the vanguard, with interferon, a medicine created with Cuban medical technology,” Maduro said in March. “Cuban interferon is in Venezuela to help patients who might have this issue in the future.”

Maduro’s Venezuela claims to have documented nearly 90,000 cases of coronavirus and 773 deaths since the outbreak began, despite the Maduro regime’s close ties to nations with significant outbreaks, such as China and Russia. Many global experts doubt the authenticity of the Maduro regime’s numbers, as only individuals the socialist regime approves may access tests to confirm a coronavirus infection. Venezuela is home to one of the world’s worst healthcare systems, lacking proper supplies of nearly every drug on the W.H.O. list of medicines necessary to run a functional medical system.

While everyone from world leaders to Republican U.S. Senators have rushed to congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, President Trump has not conceded. Votes are still being counted from Pennsylvania to Arizona. There are now reports that several Georgia counties used the same electronic voting software that flipped some 6,000 votes intended for President Trump in Michigan to Joe Biden. That software is being used in 28 states, according to the company’s website.

Officials in Georgia have announced a recount because the race in the Peach State is too close to call. The Trump campaign has issued several legal challenges and has lawsuits pending in several states. The Nevada Republican Party, alleging thousands of instances of voter fraud, had its legal team issue a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding the alleged voter fraud.

He was 80.

Trebek died at home early Sunday with family and friends surrounding him, “Jeopardy!” studio Sony said in a statement.

Trebek presided over the beloved quiz show for more than 30 years.

He was a master of the format, engaging in friendly banter with contestants and appearing genuinely pleased when they answered correctly.

He was also able to move the game along in a brisk no-nonsense fashion whenever people struggled for answers.

The Canadian-born Trebek was more than qualified for the job, having started his game show career on “Reach for the Top” in his native country.

Moving to the U.S. in 1973, he appeared on “The Wizard of Odds,” “Classic Concentration,” “To Tell the Truth,” “High Rollers,” “The $128,000 Question” and “Double Dare.”"

Matt Gaetz Has Coronavirus,"Actor Chris Evans spread a claim that Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has the coronavirus as Gaetz has said “this story is false.”

“Mark ‘Not Controlling the Pandemic’ Meadows AND Matt ‘Gas Mask’ Gaetz both test positive for Covid???? Wow. Just wow. The timing is stunning,” tweeted Chris Evans on Saturday. “Also, when I typed in ‘gaetz’, I swear on everything, my autocorrect changed it to ‘farts’.”

The Avengers star, however, had tweeted a false claim, as representative Gaetz maintained that he does not have the coronavirus.

“This story is false. I have the antibodies, not the virus. Politico DC is barely journalism,” the congressman said.

This is not the first time Chris Evans may have posted questionable content to his social media accounts.

In September, the Captain America star appeared to accidentally share a picture of a penis to Instagram, sending Twitter and social media wild in speculation that the photo was in fact one of himself.

While playing a round of the smartphone game “Heads Up,” Evans shared an unedited video with his 5.7 million followers which revealed a bunch of personal videos and photos, including one of an erect penis.

Over the summer, the Trump-bashing star launched what he called a “bipartisan” political website, claiming to present a fair and unbiased take on important issues, despite attacking the president and other conservatives for years.

Evans had already made his own political biases known by repeatedly attacking President Trump, calling the commander in chief a “dumb shit,” a “shitty playground bully,” and a “reckless moron.”

“That motherfucker’s not alive. That’s not a live person. That’s a corpse y’all that’s talking to us right now. Piece of shit. Piece of indignant ass shit. You’re supposed to answer questions motherfucker. You are [a] fucking official,” Jones screamed.

On Friday, McConnell refused to take questions on the state of the presidential race, instead referring to his latest tweet on the matter. “I know it’s reasonable for you to ask, but I get to decide what I say,” he said at the time. “I’ve already explained it. I’ve already explained it. It won’t make a difference how many times you ask. I’ve already given you my answer. I say to America, just take a look at what I had to say this morning.”

“Here’s how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not.

“There’s no reason why that can’t be done while they count. They’re not mutually exclusive,” Alex Winter said in a tweet on Friday.

In another tweet to his more than one hundred thousand Twitter followers, Winter said “Breaking news: Joseph Biden elected 46th president of the United States (there, I called it, have a great weekend everyone).”

The presidential election isn’t over. Votes are still being counted from Pennsylvania to Arizona. There are now reports that two Georgia counties used the same electronic voting software that flipped some 6,000 votes intended for President Trump in Michigan to Joe Biden. Officials in Georgia have announced a recount because the race in the Peach State is too close to call. The Trump campaign has lawsuits pending in several states. The Nevada Republican Party, alleging thousands of instances of voter fraud, had its legal team issue a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding the alleged voter fraud. Justice Sam Alito, on Friday, issued an order to election officials in Pennsylvania to segregate mail-in ballots received after Election Day.

Not only does Alex Winter want White House officials arrested, he also said that people shouldn’t “feel for” President Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has contracted the coronavirus."

We have to unite ourselves.”

Maher said, “‘You complete me’ doesn’t mean because we’re exactly alike. It means because we are different. I don’t want to live in a country without the red states. I like traveling there. When people talk to you in Oklahoma, they’re not scanning the room to see if there’s someone more important. Because, frankly, when I’m there, there never is. Also, they laugh like nobody’s watching. They don’t have a non-dairy, gluten-free, hypoallergenic stick up their ass. Even the pro-lifers will laugh at a good dead baby joke. Look, I’m pro-choice, but I also get it that a fetus is irrefutably becoming a human life. So, can I see why some people think you are actually the one who’s deplorable? Yes, I can. So, let’s all stop doing that. Let’s all stop seeing each other as deplorable. Wednesday, Biden said, ‘We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies.'”

He added, “We don’t all see the world the same way. Get over it. During the campaign, there was a lot of talk about who can unite us. No president can unite us. We have to unite ourselves.”

Maher continued that America either has to forgive differences or “turn into the Balkans.” He further stated that “it kinda is happening here. People were afraid in this election to display lawn signs for the candidate of their choice if it was in a neighborhood where that was a decidedly minority opinion.”

“We’re taping this just a little while after Donald Trump walked into the White House briefing room and tried to poison American democracy,” Colbert said in a full-frontal attack against President Trump. “That’s why I’m not sitting down yet. I just don’t feel like it yet. That’s also why I’m dressed for a funeral. Because Donald Trump tried really hard to kill something tonight.”

“Just nonsensical stuff about illegal vote dumps and corrupt election officials and secret Democratic counting cabals and, I don’t know, long-form birth certificates, probably. It’s all the same,” Stephen Colbert continued. “And if you didn’t know that Joe Biden was getting close to 270, Donald Trump just provided all the proof you will ever need.”

Colbert then insisted that Trump’s actions are “breaking his heart.” The president’s campaign is contesting the election in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The Department of Justice is investigating alleged voter fraud in Nevada.

“We all knew he would do this,” Colbert said. “What I did not know is that it would hurt so much. I didn’t expect this to break my heart. For him to cast a dark shadow on our most sacred right, from the briefing room in the White House—our house, not his—that is devastating.”

“This is heartbreaking for the same reason that I didn’t want him to get COVID, certainly why I wanted him to survive, because he is the president of the United States,” he added. “That office means something, and that office should have some shred of decency.”

Colbert then attacked Republicans for not speaking out against Trump.

“For all the predictable behavior of the last few days and the last four years, right now something unpredictable needs to happen,” the host insisted. “Republicans have to speak up. All of them. Because for evil to succeed, all that is necessary is for good men to do nothing. So say something, right now, Republicans.”

Colbert then warned Republicans to “get off the Trump train.”

“You only survived this up until now because a lot of voters didn’t want to believe everything that was obvious to so many of us: that Donald Trump is a fascist,” Colbert exploded. “And when it comes to democracy versus fascism, there are not fine people on both sides. So, you need to choose: Donald Trump or the American people?”

Colbert concluded by saying that he will not replay anything Trump is saying now as the election counts continue. “We’re not going to show you a second of what that sad, frightened fraud said tonight. Because it’s poison. And I like you,” he said.

“Dear Trump voters, Donald Trump betrayed you completely. You deserved better than him,” the Two and a Half Men star said in a lengthy Twitter diatribe.

Dear Trump voters Donald Trump betrayed you completely. You deserved better than him. — Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) November 6, 2020

“Hollywood sold you the image of an incredibly competent business man. But it was a lie,” said Jon Cryer. “His businesses were a mess. They just wanted to make an entertaining show.”

“He never actually had a plan to replace Obamacare. He just knew if he complained about it, folks would support him,” insisted Cryer in a follow-up tweet.

In 2017, however, the individual mandate in Obamacare was repealed by President Trump’s tax bill, which the president said meant Obamacare has “essentially” been repealed.

“Mexico didn’t pay for the wall. Our military did. And he only completed five new miles of it,” added Cryer in his Twitter rant.

President Trump has argued that Mexico helped “pay for the wall” through the tariffs imposed on that country, taxing all imports from Mexico.

Mexico didn’t pay for the wall. Our military did. And he only completed five new miles of it. — Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) November 6, 2020

“He didn’t even significantly change the employment rate. It simply continued the same rate of growth that Obama had,” insisted the Pretty in Pink actor in a follow-up tweet. “All the while he was enriching himself by golfing at and promoting his own resorts. Publicity that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars if it had been advertising.”

“He also enriched himself by using money you donated to his campaign to pay himself and his family. He rented himself office space and gave his kids and their partners jobs,” insisted the Hannah Montana actor in another tweet.

The president’s net worth, however, has actually decreased since taking office as President of the United States. “And he just kept lying to you. Literally thousands of objectively dishonest lies.”

And he just kept lying to you. Literally thousands of objectively dishonest lies. — Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) November 6, 2020

“And now he’s lying to you about the election. He can’t ‘claim’ states. And Republican poll observers ARE watching the vote tabulation. And there’s no evidence of fraud,” added Cryer, suggesting that nothing untoward has occurred during the 2020 election.

“He’s betraying you and American. And like I said, you deserved better,” the actor concluded, attempting to appeal to Trump supporters.

Trump addressed reporters at the White House on Thursday evening and suggested rampant voter fraud was occurring in key states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania. “If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” Trump said. “But we think there’ll be a lot of litigation because we can’t have an election stolen like this.”

According to Kimmel, Trump’s “despicable and incoherent attack on democracy” was sufficient grounds for his arrest.

Watch below:

“Well, that’s a different type of concession speech,” said Jimmy Kimmel after Trump’s address. “This was — I won’t bore you or give him the pleasure of showing what he said tonight. But the only thing he didn’t do is pull off his wig and reveal that he’s been Vlad Putin all along. It was a litany of lies, threats, just a despicable and incoherent attack on democracy in the United States. At the end of that speech, he should have been arrested.”

Kimmel, who has railed against Trump throughout his presidency, struggled to contain his gleeful mood as he described “watching a presidency bleed out in real time.”

“They’re still counting the votes, whether Donald Trump likes it or not. But it would appear that our Burger King has been flame-broiled for good,” said Kimmel. “We are watching a presidency bleed out in real time.”

“By the way, a lot of ballots that come in after Election Day are from our troops serving overseas, and the irony of a draft-dodger trying to negate those votes is more delicious than the 12 little dunk-cups of honey mustard he dipped his McNuggets in today,” he added."

“I hate Donald trump and if you like him: I hate you too. Now what,” the “Fancy” rapper said in response to a Twitter user who told her to be “careful” when it comes to politics. Minutes earlier, the Billboard Music Award winner retweeted a meme depicting her giving President Trump the middle finger.

Indeed, Iggy Azalea is far from the only left-wing celebrity to express disdain for not just the president but those who support him and his re-election. Actress Janelle Monae opted to alienate half the country in an inflammatory, now-deleted tweet of her own.

“Fuck Donald Tromp and every American citizen, celebrity, white woman, black man, ETC who supported him burnnnnnnnnnn,” the Hidden Figures star said alongside a picture of her holding up her middle finger.

Her display of hostility did not come as a surprise given her past remarks. In July 2019, Monae referred to Trump as the “racist in chief” and suggested that “racists, sexists, white nationalists, white supremacists, etc,” comprise the Republican Party.

the Republican Party 🖕🏻has wanted a pawn to carry out their agenda & help do their dirty work for a while .

“There is that unfortunate self-hate through all my culture, through all South America, Central America and the Caribbean from the Conquest. And that’s hard to fight,” said Leguizamo in a recent interview with Hollywood Reporter. “When that beautiful woman from Roma [Yalitza Aparicio] was put on the cover of Latin Vogue, people wrote horrible letters. ‘How dare you put such an ugly face on magazines?’ That’s the insidious self-hate,” continued the John Wick actor, who went on to say that “self-hate” is also why there are Latin Trump supporters.

“I address that back to the self-hate that I was telling you about,” Leguizamo told Hollywood Reporter. “And also sometimes people don’t care about others — they just care about their finances.”

According to exit polls, President Donald Trump’s strength among Latinos in three key battleground states — Florida, Texas and Arizona — helped secure him key electoral votes. Meanwhile, Joe Biden underperformed in Florida’s Miami-Dade County, which is made up of nearly 70 percent of Hispanic voters.

The actor added that he believes President Trump did a better job with the Latino vote than Biden because “he was aggressive about it, you’ve got to court us.”

“He kept saying, even in his debate, he mentioned the word Latinos. Biden didn’t ever want to mention it,” said Leguizamo said of President Trump. “I know Biden had a lot of Latin people in his campaign, but he needed to talk about our issues and about us and mention us. And court us. You’ve got to court us.”

Leguizamo went on to reiterate that Latin people who are Republicans suffer from “self-hate,” adding that it could also have to do with them being “hyper-religious,” or their “machoism.”

“There are Latin people that are Republican for whatever reason — self-hate or hyper-religious. It touches on some of the machoism too,” he said. “It makes them feel, ‘We’re assimilated’ — you know that weird thing that happens to immigrants sometimes: If they attack other immigrants then they look less immigrant? There’s a history here.”

This is not the actor’s first time attacking Latinos who support the president.

Last month, Leguizamo compared Latinos who support Trump to “roaches for Raid,” claiming that they don’t care about other Latinos “who are in cages.” On Wednesday, the actor compared Floridians to rats after President Trump secured a convincing victory in Florida with the support of Cubans and Venezuelans voting for the president over Biden on Election Day.

Leguizamo is not the only member of Hollywood trying to wrap his head around why an increasing number of Latino or Hispanic people are Trump supporters.

Actress Natalie Morales recently took to Twitter to deliver a tirade in which she claimed that the hundreds of thousands of Cuban Americans who voted to re-election President Trump “are 10000 percent brainwashed.”

Anderson made this belated discovery while playing her latest role as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the epic Netflix series The Crown. As she is at pains to emphasise, Anderson does not remotely share the Conservative leader’s politics.

She tells Harper’s Bazaar that it was all she could do to stop herself complaining that the script — written by her boyfriend Peter Morgan — didn’t go in hard enough on Mrs Thatcher’s supposed political failings:

At times, she says she found herself questioning the portrayal – why wasn’t there more on the poll tax or Northern Ireland? But she was given no special treatment as the writer’s partner to shape her character. “For our own sanity, and actually for the benefit of the relationship, we had very clear boundaries,” she says. “I am not going to comment on the script, but you are not allowed to comment on the performance!”

But then Anderson had the most amazing insight. Pretending to be Margaret Thatcher doesn’t mean you actually are Margaret Thatcher or that you endorse any of her policies:

“I had to get to a point where it’s nothing to do with my opinions of her policies, of her actions,” says Anderson. “It is only about her as a human being and her motivation as a politician and as a mother.”

Well done, Gillian! The name for this mysterious process is ‘acting’.

‘Acting’ — pretending to be someone you are not — is a technique which has been known since at least the era of Aristophanes. When audiences saw men on stage wearing masks, some of them impersonating women, they weren’t fooled. They knew that feigning was part of the deal. That’s why actors were known as ‘hypocrites’. (Ancient Greek: hypokrites).

However in the last decade, due to a collective outbreak of woke amnesia from Hollywood to the BBC, the entire film and TV industry has forgotten what acting actually involves. Hence the new strictures on playing outside your life experience: gay men can only be played by gay men, lesbians only by lesbians, people of ethnicity only by people of the precise ethnicity, disabled people by disabled people, and so on.

Gillian Anderson had better keep quiet about this dangerous discovery she’s just made. If she’s not careful it could easily cost her her job.

Joe Biden underperformed in Florida’s Miami-Dade County — which is made up of nearly 70 percent of Hispanic voters, including Cuban Americans. “The ads, FB videos and misinformation targeting FL **SINCE BEFORE OBAMA** about how all Dems are radical socialist commies have been widely and continuously spread and also widely underestimated,” continued Morales in a follow-up tweet. “And, they work. They work because they use and abuse the trauma of my people.”

Morales goes on to say that many Cuban Americans are not voting for Democrats due to the similarities they see the party having with socialism, as they themselves have actually experienced and fled a socialist country. “They were sold the same promises in their countries: ‘Equality for all!’ ‘Socialism works and everyone is equal!'” wrote Morales.

Cuban Americans, whoever, have told Breitbart News that Democratic Party policies promoted by the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are the reason their parents fled communist Cuba to come to the U.S.

“But those promises turned sour. They turned communist. They turned into Castro. Into Maduro. They turned into suffering and fleeing and death and trauma,” the actress added.

Democrats, pundits, many in the elite media, and large chunks of the Hollywood left have spent years constantly castigating President Trump and his supporters as racists. Despite the smears, President Trump won the highest share of non-white voters of any Republican presidential candidate since 1960.

Trump won 26 percent of the non-white vote, according to an Edison exit poll. That’s the highest share of non-white voter support for a GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon, who won 32 percent of the non-white vote in 1960. Trump won 21 percent of the non-white vote in 2016.

In fact, 18 percent of black men voted for Trump this year compared to 16 percent in 2016, according to the Edison exit poll. Black women backed Trump at a 4 percent clip in 2016. In 2020, 8 percent of black women backed his re-election. Trump even doubled his share of gay, Jewish, and Hispanic voters.

President Trump increased his share of minority voters across the board in this election. Indeed, Trump earned more non-white votes than any Republican since 1960, at 26 percent, according to Yahoo News.

Also, an Edison exit poll found that 18 percent of black men voted for Trump this year compared to 16 percent in 2016. His share of the black women voters also rose, going from 4 percent in 2016 to 8 percent this year. Trump even doubled his share of gay voters and Hispanic voters.

This week, Black Entertainment Television (BET) founder and business mogul Bob Johnson said four more years of Donald Trump in the White House would be a good thing for black Americans.

“For African-Americans, under Trump’s leadership, we have the lowest unemployment rate for black Americans in over 50 years. We also saw investments in black businesses and black communities through the Opportunity Zones,” Johnson said on CNBC.

In an article written by Lily Herman for the publication aimed at young people, she admits that there was no “resounding repudiation” of Trumpism that the left had been hoping for.

Herman wrote:

The 2020 election is not going to be the resounding repudiation of Trumpism that many had hoped for. I hate to break it to those people, but that was never going to be the case. There was a certain kind of traumatic shock that came with the 2016 election, particularly among liberal white voters. Who knew that white America was that racist? they asked. Who knew it was so misogynist? Who knew so many people could be so easily duped? This time around, there was hope that Biden could pull off a landslide and prove that 2016 had just been a fluke. But that faith was predicated on the ahistorical notion that Americans — especially white Americans — would rise to the occasion, and that Biden’s promises of a return to an immediate normalcy would in fact hold true

""Throwing blame on a lone scapegoat is easy; acknowledging and then dismantling a structurally oppressive system filled with people very loudly advocating for a white Christian ethno-state is much harder, less convenient, and more violent."" –@lkherman https://t.co/66JBrcsjvM — Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) November 5, 2020

Herman went on to explain that the reason for Biden’s lack of success is a result of “white supremacy, misogyny, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and so much more.”

She wrote:

To be completely honest, while various pundits may say otherwise, I’m not sure any other Democratic candidate would’ve fared much better than Biden. That’s not due to the fact that he was some sort of ultra-unifying candidate of sheer perfection, but instead because it’s hard to go up against a gigantic machine of people who are actively and enthusiastically voting for white supremacy, misogyny, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and so much more.

All this is despite the fact that President Trump secured a far higher percentage of the minority vote than he did in 2016, especially among Hispanics, Jews, and African-Americans. He received 26 percent on the non-white vote, the highest percentage for a Republican president since 1960. Meanwhile, the only group Trump lost ground with was white men. Yet according to Herman, those people were “very loudly advocating for a white Christian ethnostate.”

“Throwing blame on a lone scapegoat is easy; acknowledging and then dismantling a structurally oppressive system filled with people very loudly advocating for a white Christian ethno-state is much harder, less convenient, and more violent,” she wrote."

However, Steelers fans’ takeover of AT&T Stadium in Dallas this weekend has Ben Roethlisberger thinking that a newer and larger title might be in order for his team.

After a hard-fought win over the Cowboys on Sunday, Roethlisberger remarked that the large number of Steelers fan in attendance suggests his team deserves an international nickname.

“We know that everybody is coming for us,” Roethlisberger said. “I don’t want to take any shots at anybody, but if you didn’t know who America’s Team was, then you should’ve seen the stands and all the Terrible Towels. Dallas might be America’s Team, but we are the World’s Team.”

The Cowboys have been known as “America’s Team” for quite some time.

“Bob Ryan, an editor-in-chief at NFL Films, gave the Cowboys their nickname in a 1978 team highlight film,” Pro Football Talk reports.

“TV ratings, merchandising sales, Forbes’ estimated franchise valuations, Harris Polls and stadium attendance say the Cowboys still are “America’s Team.” That despite their 25-year championship drought and their current 2-7 record, which has them closer to the No. 1 overall choice than a Super Bowl title.”

Normally, there are large numbers of Steelers fans whenever Pittsburgh is on the road. Along with the Green Bay Packers, the team has fan clubs in most major cities across the country."

De Blasio said that “the more that people wear masks, practice social distancing, all those basics, the more we’re able to fight back that second wave.”

Later, in response to a question on the celebrations over the weekend possibly increasing cases, de Blasio said, “We’re always looking at that and any other situation like it,” and continued, “I had this conversation with the doctors this morning, the huge difference between outdoors with a mask versus indoors without a mask. This is really what we’re seeing, decisively. Those outdoor gatherings, always something to keep an eye on, but if people have a mask on and they’re outdoors, we haven’t seen too much ill come of that. Increasingly, the concern is more and more people indoors…not enough…wearing a mask, that’s overwhelmingly where our concern is.”

In the suit, Luhnow claims Astros Owner Jim Crane and MLB Rob Manfred made him a “scapegoat for the organization” in the aftermath of the scandal, CBS Sports reported.

Luhnow further claims that in place of a real investigation into the actions by members of the team, the league and team ownership engaged in a “negotiation resolution” to enable the team to “keep its (2017) World Series championship, went to great lengths to publicly exonerate Crane, and scapegoated Luhnow for a sign-stealing scandal that he had no knowledge of and played no part in.”

The suit further alleges that the league bartered with Crane to get him off the hook, including vetting penalties with Crane in a series of proposals during their discussions. “Those negotiations proved beneficial to Crane and the Astros,” Luhnow’s filing alleges.

Luhnow has maintained his innocence since the scandal erupted across the baseball world, but MLB handed him a one-year suspension as it did with Astros manager AJ Hinch. The Astros fired both men immediately. The team was also fined $5 million and lost four high draft picks for the 2020 season.

It may not end up sending him into retirement, though. The 53-year-old executive is in the running for several front-office openings now that his suspension has ended.

With the Lakers taking the prize during the NBA Championships this season, the prospect that the team would visit the White House were not good. But James was quick to jump to Twitter this weekend to say that he is finally ready to go to Washington.

On Saturday, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green asked the hardcore left-wing basketball star if he was ready to visit the White House.

“Yoooo @KingJames y’all can go to the White House and celebrate y’all title G!” Green tweeted.

To that, James replied, “YO we back up in there my G!!! I’m taking my tequila and vino too!”

LeBron James gave his nod to the Biden/Harris ticket in a last second endorsement only one day before Election Day.

Should Biden be certified as the 46th president of the United States and the L.A. Lakers do go to the White House to celebrate their championship, they will be the first NBA team to visit the people’s house in four years.

Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner for flaunting the league’s coronavirus rules during the World Series, after the player apologized.

“I sincerely apologize to everyone on the field for failing to appreciate the risks of returning to the field,” Turner wrote in a statement issued on Friday. “I have spoken with almost every teammate, coach, and staff member, and my intentions were never to make anyone uncomfortable or put anyone at further risk.”

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred also commented on the incident noting that Turner was “actively encouraged” to apologize for ignoring his sentence of isolation after having tested positive for the virus as the World Series was coming to its end.

Turner tested positive ahead of Game 6 of the 2020 World Series, was removed from the game, and ordered to go into a period of isolation per the league’s coronavirus policies. But as soon as the game ended, the player left his isolation room and went onto the field to celebrate the big win.

The league excoriated Turner for so baldly ignoring the isolation rules, claiming that Turner “emphatically refused” to obey the rules and “put everyone he came in contact with at-risk” of contracting the virus.

Turner went on to apologize further for his actions that night.

“I was under the impression that team officials did not object to my returning to the field for a picture with my wife,” Turner continued. “However, what was intended to be a photo capturing the two of us turned into several greetings and photos where I briefly and unwisely removed my mask. In hindsight, I should have waited until the field was clear of others to take that photo with my wife.”

That simple and direct way of addressing our nation’s current election drama did not sit well with Fox Sports 1’s Jason McIntyre, who captioned the tweet with, “CTE,” implying that Walker was suffering from brain damage.

Walker, contrary to McIntyre’s assertion, functions quite well mentally and physically, and has enjoyed great success both during and after his professional sports career.

McIntyre, meanwhile, apparently doesn’t enjoy much. His Twitter timeline contains several mean-spirited political tweets. Specifically, one where he seems to be in favor of cops using tear gas, or some type of force to remove “Stop the Count” protesters in Michigan.

Olbermann took to Twitter to rail at Carlson’s discussions about the 2020 election results.

The former ESPN anchor jumped to Twitter to accuse Carlson of calling for Trump voters to engage in violence after he assumed that Carlson noted that it is the right side of the political aisle that owns most of the guns in the nation.

Olbermann reacted to someone else’s tweet that claimed, “Tucker is now telling his audience that Trump’s supporters own 6–70% of the guns and they could take to the streets blood ‘would flow.'”

To that, Olbermann said, “Again, this is an overt and unmistakable call for widespread violence and requires the arrest of Tucker Carlson.”

Olbermann later tried to delete the tweet so that no one could see it.

The truth is, though, that Tucker Carlson did not call for Trump voters to engage in political violence with their guns. He also did not even hint at such a scenario. The segment liberals misconstrued did feature someone saying that Trump voters own “60 to 70 percent of the guns” and that there could be blood in the streets, but it was not Carlson who said it. It was a Democrat operative named Lawrence Wilkerson.

Here is what the Democrat operative said in August on Bill Maher’s NBO show:

“If Trump calls his base to the streets with their guns — his base owns something like 60 to 70% of the 300, 400 million guns in America. If they answer that call and come to the streets with guns, then we probably are going to have a need for the military. And then all bets are off as to how much blood might flow.”

The news was initially broken by MLB Network reporter Jon Heyman:

Breaking: Alex Cora is back as Red Sox manager — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) November 6, 2020

Red Sox people flew down to Puerto Rico to interview Cora late last week. Apparently, he answered all their questions satisfactorily. — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) November 6, 2020

Heyman added that Cora apparently beat out Sam Fudd for the job.

Cora, who was the Astros manager for the World Series-winning 2018 season, was suspended by MLB for his role in that organization’s sign-stealing scandal. Cora lost his job one day after MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred declared that Cora was “an active participant” in the sign stealing scheme.

“Given the findings and the commissioner’s ruling, we collectively decided that it would not be possible for Alex to effectively lead the club going forward,” the team said in a statement attributed to owner John Henry, chairman Tom Werner, CEO Sam Kennedy and Cora.

Cora was suspended from pro baseball for a single season. That suspension is now over since the 2020 season is finished. Indeed, Cora was not permitted to even discuss future work in the MLB until his suspension ended on October 27.

The Astros also fired manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow over the scandal.

NASCAR’s only Black full-time driver didn’t watch the news before this summer, one of national unrest over politics and racial justice.

He tuned in and quickly became an unwitting national activist. Wallace successfully called on NASCAR to ban the display of the Confederate Flag at races, ran a “Black Lives Matter” paint scheme and became the central figure in a sport facing its own racial reckoning.

Wallace overnight had a national audience for his “Peace. Love. Understanding,” mantra and a position to exact change. On Friday, the 27-year-old was named the Comcast Community Champion of the Year, a prestigious industry award that honors NASCAR members for philanthropic efforts.

“I just did what I felt was right and what needed to be said and done and stood behind that proudly,” Wallace told The Associated Press. “To outsiders looking in, they think it takes a lot of courage, but it’s just another day to me.

“I said ‘Let’s take down the flag.’ It shouldn’t be a big deal, but now people say it is a big deal and its reshaping the sport. I didn’t have my mind set out to do that.”

Comcast donated $60,000 to Wallace’s “Live To Be Different Foundation” that aids individuals in overcoming race, gender, disabilities or socio-economic situations to fulfill their potential.

“Bubba embodies everything this award stands for and we look forward to standing together as he continues to make a positive impact in all of our communities and the industry,” said Matt Lederer, Comcast Vice President of Brand Partnerships and Activation.

Comcast, a premier partner of NASCAR’s Cup Series and the title sponsor of the second-tier Xfinity Series, has donated more than $700,000 to 18 different charitable organizations since launching the award in 2015.

Wallace was one of three semifinalists. He joined Martinsville Speedway President Clay Campbell and Matt Kaulig, owner of Xfinity Series team Kaulig Racing. Comcast awarded $30,000 each to the Campbell Family Foundation and the Kaulig Charitable Giving Programs.

Wallace until this year considered himself a millennial just trying to jump-start his career. He had a good job as driver of NASCAR’s iconic No. 43 for Richard Petty Motorsports, a mid-level team that struggled with securing sponsorship and posting consistent results.

Although Wallace has six career Truck Series victories and is the first Black driver to win a NASCAR national series race since Wendell Scott in 1964, he’s winless in 111 starts at the elite Cup level. His RPM team isn’t among the best and the team has outperformed to Wallace’s career-best 22nd ranking headed into Sunday’s season finale at Phoenix Raceway.

Now he’s NASCAR’s newest superstar team with a foundation just finding its footing. Wallace launched “Live To Be Different” in 2017 to award $10,000 merit-based scholarships for students at his North Carolina alma mater Northwest Cabarrus High School.

His mission has since multiplied. It began this spring when he first began speaking out against racial injustice in America and then he called for a ban of Confederate flags at NASCAR events.

Some fans railed against Wallace, who was assigned security at tracks because of threats NASCAR received against the driver. A plane in June pulled a Confederate flag over Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, where a parade of Confederate flag-waving protesters drove back and forth outside the track entrance.

When an RPM crew member discovered the garage pulldown rope in Wallace’s stall had been fashioned into a noose, NASCAR called the FBI and said Wallace was the victim of a hate crime. An investigation found Wallace was not a victim, leading to accusations he was part of a hoax.

The calls of fraud included one from President Donald Trump, who suggested Wallace owed an apology to the rival race teams that stood in solidarity with him at Talladega. Wallace now found himself in the middle of a fierce political debate with a responsibility to back his words with action.

“Being thrown into the political fire motivated me to do what’s right — I need to do what’s right and control my own destiny,” Wallace said of voting. “That was a pretty big to do and I didn’t know what to do. It was kind of hectic for me because first time, and kind of a big thing to do, so walking out of there, my knees were trembling.”

Wallace has become his own “BW” brand and pulled in millions of dollars in sponsorship that gave him free agent flexibility to take NASCAR to another level. He will be the driver next season of a new No. 23 Toyota for team owners Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin and the car will be primarily funded by sponsorship Wallace sold. Jordan becomes the first Black majority NASCAR team owner with a Black driver.

Social media last week was full of photos of young Black children dressed as Wallace for Halloween, images that again reminded Wallace of the impact he’s made. He’s honored but doesn’t feel he’s done anything besides speak for peace, for love, and for understanding.

“People say I’m doing this all for attention … that’s not true,” Wallace said. “This is who I am. I’ve gotten (fined by NASCAR) for saying what’s on my mind, my wallet has been hurt because of that.

“This is me. I feel what’s right, I say it, and that’s it,” he added. “It’s Bubba Wallace and I say what I want to.”"

These penalties are in addition to a $250,000 team penalty and a $100,000 penalty assessed to head coach Jon Gruden, after masks were found to be worn improperly during the team’s Week 2 game against the Saints.

According to ESPN:

Also, tight end Darren Waller was fined $30,000 and nine teammates, including quarterback Derek Carr, were dinged $15,000 each for appearing Oct. 5 at a Waller Foundation charity event maskless and mixing with the crowd. In total, Las Vegas has racked up $1.185 million in fines for breaking COVID-19 protocols, and the Raiders are the first team to lose a draft pick over the violations. … Two weeks ago, Pro Bowl right tackle Trent Brown tested positive for COVID-19, but because he was not wearing his tracer at the team facility, and several players were not wearing masks after rookie cornerback Damon Arnette had gone on the reserve/COVID-19 list, the four other members of Las Vegas’ starting offensive line — left tackle Kolton Miller, left guard Denzelle Good, center Rodney Hudson and right guard Gabe Jackson — were deemed high-risk close contacts and all had to self-quarantine during the week.

The call for Trump’s apprehension came during a rant on Olbermann’s YouTube program Olbermann vs Trump, shortly after Trump addressed the nation on Thursday evening.

“We think there’s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof, it’s going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land, you’ll see,” Trump told the nation from the White House. “We think there’ll be a lot of litigation, because we cannot have an election stolen like this.

“We want every legal vote counted, and I want every legal vote counted,” Trump added. “We want openness and transparency – no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day.”

This bit of defiance and determination to take the election to the courts was not well-received by Olbermann who launched into a tirade.

“TRUMP HAS LOST HIS MIND AND MUST BE REMOVED, TONIGHT,” Olbermann wrote in a caption of the tweet for his video. “The coup attempt, we can survive. A mentally incompetent president, we may not. Instead, he will stay, and when he concedes he will simultaneously begin a campaign for 2024.”

In the video, Olbermann referred to Trump as “President Karen” and called him a “lame duck president.” The former SportsCenter anchor also referenced a report which claimed that Trump had said he would run again in 2024, should he lose the election.

TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED AND ARRESTED, TONIGHT. Gripped by a paranoid delusion, threatening the nation's safety, this can't wait any longer. It won't happen; in fact he'll probably concede and instantly announce he's running in '24.

Olbermann is a frequent and vocal critic of Trump. Last month, Olbermann said that Trump should be given the “death penalty” for “each count” of the 220,000 Americans who have died from the coronavirus."

“It says so much about America,” she tweeted on Nov. 5, “that black people protest because of a lack of justice, dignity and respect and white people are “protesting” because they can’t get a racist president in office.”

Hill has been tearing up her Twitter account during these contentious days after Election Day. On Wednesday, she warned Democrats not to reach out to Republicans even though this close election proves that the left does not have the votes to rule over politics.

Even on Election Day, before the nation knew just how contentious the election was going to be, Hill was attacking white people, accusing them of being racists for voting for Donald Trump.

It is not precisely clear how the leftist Hill and her media cohorts, who always call Trump a “racist” and a “white nationalist,” have missed that the president increased his share of minority voters across the board.

The numbers already show that Trump earned more non-white votes than any Republican since 1960, according to Yahoo News.

Yahoo cites an Edison exit poll that found that 18 percent of black men voted for Trump this year compared to 16 percent in 2016. His share of the black women voters also rose, going from 4 percent in 2016 to 8 percent this year. Trump even doubled his share of gay voters and Hispanic voters.

The team will work remotely after linebacker Jacob Martin tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. The Texans had to shut down last week as well, after guard Max Scharping tested positive.

Coronavirus concerns also complicate the NFL’s scheduled Thursday Night Football game. The 49ers had a player, Kendrick Bourne, test positive from a sample collected on Tuesday. Two players who had close contact with that player, tackle Trent Williams and receiver Brandon Aiyuk, will not play due to their close contact with Bourne.

The Texans are scheduled to play the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. The league has not yet said whether that game is in jeopardy of being postponed."

Pitaro revealed the news in a memo to ESPN employees Thursday morning:

“Prior to the pandemic, we had been deeply engaged in strategizing how best to position ESPN for future success amidst tremendous disruption in how fans consume sports.” Pitaro wrote. “The pandemic’s significant impact on our business clearly accelerated those forward-looking discussions. In the short term, we enacted various steps like executive and talent salary reductions, furloughs and budget cuts, and we implemented innovative operations and production approaches, all in an effort to weather the COVID storm.

Pitaro continued, “We have, however, reached an inflection point. The speed at which change is occurring requires great urgency, and we must now deliver on serving sports fans in a myriad of new ways. Placing resources in support of our direct-to-consumer business strategy, digital, and, of course, continued innovative television experiences, is more critical than ever.”

As Breitbart’s Warner Todd Huston reports:

ESPN is not alone in losing customers. In general, cable is experiencing steep declines in customers as Americans cancel their cable and opt for streaming services. In July, for instance, Verizon reported a loss of 81,000 pay-TV subscribers for its FiOS service which is on top of a 25 percent decline in revenue for its media unit. Only months before that, AT&T noted that it had lost 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2019.

It’s unknown how many of the eliminated positions will be at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, and how many will be from their national and international workforce. At the moment, ESPN has 4,000 employees at Bristol and roughly 2,500 nationally and internationally.

The Ranger Carbon Hunter 22″ has a MAGPUL MOE fixed stock, a Brenton USA trigger that breaks crisp and clean, and a carbon fiber reinforced handguard.

The reinforced handguard provides strength and integrity that allows for flawless use with bipods and tripods. We put an Accu-Tac bipod on our Ranger Carbon Hunter and also used a tripod in the field.

The Ranger Carbon Hunter has a NiB coated bolt carrier assembly, which Brenton USA suggests is an integral aspect of the rifle’s performance in harsh or unwelcoming conditions. This rifle was not made to be babied, but to be used. It was designed to be the rifle you carry out into the field, whether it is a sunny autumn day or a rainy, cold and windy night.

The bolt assembly also contributes to an action that is among the smoothest we have felt.

The Ranger Carbon Hunter also ships with a threaded barrel, so it is suppressor ready. We put a Phoenix Weaponry .30 caliber suppressor on the Ranger Carbon Hunter and it was quiet; real quiet.

The Carbon Hunter we shot was chambered in 6.8 SPC (Special Purpose Cartridge), giving the rifle accurate, knockdown power up of 300 yards. We put this distance to the test on a coyote hunt in which the predators were roughly 225 yards out and the Carbon Hunter delivered.

The combination of the indefatigable action, the Brenton USA trigger, the 22″ free-floating barrel, the ergonomics, and overall design of the rifle, made for hunting and targeting shooting experiences that were rewarding. Brenton USA talks a lot of talk about the Ranger Carbon Hunter, and the rifle backs up that talk with performance.

Brown signed with the Bucs on Oct. 27, despite his claims that he was going to retire from the NFL. Brown, though, could not hit the field right away because he was still forced to fulfill several weeks of suspensions for multiple off-field incidents.

In January, the 32-year-old player faced a possible life sentence for felony burglary with battery after being arrested for an assault of a truck driver in Florida.

He was also ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation over the incident.

The team also made several other roster moves with Brown’s return, including signing offensive lineman John Molchon to the practice squad. Running back Kenjon Barner was also moved off the reserve/suspended list and into the practice squad. Meanwhile, Zack Bailey and Aca’Cedric Ware were both released from the practice squad.

In conjunction with bringing Brown back to active status, the team also waived receiver Cyril Grayson.

According to ESPN, the bench on the sidelines will now stretch 60 yards and will be situated between the 20-yard lines. With the increased length, the league aims to encourage social distancing among the players sitting on the sidelines.

In addition, the league will require masks in all situations in the locker room, and on or off the field, during all pre and post-game activities. Masks are also “strongly” recommended for players sitting on the bench if they are “not participating on the field or about to enter the game.”

In a recent call with the press, NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Allen Sills explained the policy update.

“What we are trying to convey and say is that masks can prevent you from becoming a high-risk contact,” Sills said on the call. “This is our goal. So it’s in [everyone’s] best interest to wear a mask for their protection and to reduce their exposure. … We believe that mask use, whether it’s in the locker room or on the sideline, it just reduces your chance of becoming a high-risk contact should someone turn positive.”

The league will also ban any in-person meetings among staffers once a positive test is reported in the front offices or among the coaching staff.

One of the most recent positive test reports came from Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey who announced on Twitter on Sunday that he was handed a positive test.

No’,"Jemele Hill communicated in no uncertain terms that she is unwilling to reach out to Trump supporters who feel like their vote was suppressed during Tuesday’s election.

Hill, who has frequently spoken out about perceived Republican efforts to “suppress” the black vote, seems to have changed her tune now that she thinks her side has won the White House.

The former ESPN personality took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack Trump’s voters, writing, “So when this is all over, we’re just supposed act like everything is cool with these people and try to reach them? Fuck. No.”

Hill was reacting to a tweet featuring a video of Trump supporters attempting stop the continued counting of votes that many fear are being manufactured to make sure Biden wins.

So when this is all over, we’re just supposed act like everything is cool with these people and try to reach them? Fuck. No. https://t.co/qfVKuyunWe — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) November 4, 2020

But, is Hill’s hateful attack on the people in the video a good recipe for growing the Democrat coalition? In an election that is coming down to a handful of votes in multiple states, it is clear that the far-left Democrat Party is not in such a strong position that they can turn their backs on all Trump supporters. The party will have to reach across the aisle to govern. But this is exactly the opposite of what Hill is suggesting.

Hill’s exclamation of hate is not a call to “heal” and begin a new government. It is a call to continued turmoil and vitriol against the Americans she clearly dislikes.

ESPN has more than 6,000 employees, but as it is losing upwards of $2 billion in annual revenue due to a constant stream of lost subscribers and difficulties arising from the coronavirus, network owner Disney clearly feels something has to give. So, according to The Athletic, ESPN is set to begin layoffs, maybe as soon as Thursday.

The site notes that a portion of the budget savings will be realized by allowing contracts with some talent to go un-renewed. Still, many behind the scenes workers — especially in remote locations — are also expected to be let go.

ESPN has been steadily shedding employees by the hundreds since 2015 when ESPN cut 350 employees. Then, in 2017, the company shed another 100 employees. Also, in 2017, the company cut its budget by $80 million.

ESPN is not alone in losing customers. In general, cable is experiencing steep declines in customers as Americans cancel their cable and opt for streaming services.

In July, for instance, Verizon reported a loss of 81,000 pay-TV subscribers for its FiOS service which is on top of a 25 percent decline in revenue for its media unit.

The day before San Francisco was set to take on the Green Bay Packers on Thursday Night Football, the team had a player test positive for the virus. Reportedly, the infected player is wide receiver Kendrick Bourne.

The team announced the closure of their facility on Wednesday.

“The San Francisco 49ers were informed today that a player has tested positive for COVID-19 and the individual went into self-quarantine,” the team confirmed in a statement. “Our organization has entered the NFL’s intensive protocol and we are working with the league on contact tracing to identify high risk individuals. All team functions will be conducted virtually today.

“The health and safety of our players, staff and community are the organization’s highest priority. We will continue to work closely with the NFL and medical professional and will follow their direction.”

Bourne gave his sample for the test on Tuesday morning. Given that Tuesday was a workday for the Niners, there’s a chance that he could have infected other players.

The NFL has not yet announced whether they will allow San Francisco’s game against Green Bay to go forward."

In quotes obtained by Sports Business Daily via Pro Football Talk, Fauci explained the even with the development of a vaccine, “mask wearing will continue well into the third or fourth quarter of 2021.”

Fauci also predicted a “graded, gradual progression towards normality.”

“Ultimately, when we get this under control — not only at the domestic, but [at] the global level — we will start to approach what we call normal,” Dr. Fauci said. “I don’t think . . . that it’s going to be at a level where people are going to feel like there are no public-health measures to be implemented until we get to the end of 2021 — at least.”

That timeline could see a significant reduction if the league develops a system which can accurately and quickly test fans at the gate. Though, that technology isn’t being widely used as of yet."

Doug Jones (D-AL) in Alabama’s race for the United States Senate.

With nearly 1.6 million votes in, and 48 percent of precincts reporting, Tuberville leads Jones 61 percent to 38.7 percent.

As of 9:18 p.m. CT, the race has been called in Tuberville’s favor by the New York Times and the Associated Press.

What was viewed as a contentious race in Alabama after Jones defeated Republican nominee Roy Moore by a 1.63 percent margin, or a little more than 20,000 votes, in 2017, ended with a victory for Republicans on Tuesday.

Tuberville received an endorsement, from President Donald Trump back in March, when Tuberville was still campaigning against former United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

….(which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2020

”Tommy Tuberville is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama,” Trump wrote. “Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down!”

“Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump added, saying “I love Alabama!”

In addition to his endorsement from Trump, Tuberville also received endorsements from the Alabama Forestry Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, and Sessions.

Democrats and certain organizations attempted to prevent Republicans from taking back Jones’ seat by fueling money towards television advertisements against Jones’ challenger.

It was reported in late August that Duty and Honor had “launched a $500,000 television advertising blitz in support of Jones’ Yellowhammer State reelection bid.”

Last year, before becoming the Democrat vice presidential nominee, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) sent out a fundraising email to her supporters after it was reported that Sessions was preparing to announce a bid to return to the Senate.

The email solicited funds and also pledged to split each contribution raised between Harris and Jones.

“Doug Jones is a great Senator, a strong defender of civil rights, and a fighter for the people of Alabama. Let’s re-elect Doug and make sure Jeff Sessions never sets foot on the Senate floor again,” the email’s pitch stated.

In recent weeks, Alabama-based Yellowhammer News broke a story detailing a group’s support for Jones and Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden, which offered Black Belt pastors $6 “per person” they get to vote early ahead of November 3’s general election.

Yellowhammer News’ Sean Ross also highlighted the spending throughout the presidential election, noting that “Jones raised $25,258,418.06 in his reelection bid, spending $24,851,769.65” and “Tuberville raised $7,226,009.13 and spent $6,730,151.08.”

Biden previously praised Jones ahead of the election, saying he needs “Doug’s voice in the Senate,” if he is elected president.

“I need Doug’s help in the Senate,” Biden said in an emailed statement. “You know, I always say this election is a battle for the soul of our country. In few places are those stakes as clear as in Alabama.”

“Every time we needed him to stand up for us, Doug Jones was there. I’m going to need Doug’s voice in the Senate,” Biden stressed.

Currently, 15 players and 12 staff have tested positive for the disease since October 24th. The team is not practicing or engaging in any football-related activities amid the outbreak.

“I share in the disappointment of our student-athletes and staff,” Wisconsin Athletic Director Barry Alvarez said.

“We have seen a level of improvement in our testing numbers, but not enough to give us confidence to resume normal activities and play our game on Saturday,” Alvarez explained.

Big 10 rules require infected players and staff to isolate form the the team for 21 days before they can return.

According to the Hill:

The Big Ten is playing a condensed eight-game regular season format. Due to its canceled match-ups that cannot be scheduled, Wisconsin must play the rest of its games this season to be eligible to compete in the Big Ten Championship game. If other teams cancel more games, the conference reportedly might use a rounded average number of games played per team to adjust the minimum rule.

Reports indicate that the Badgers starting quarterback and head coach are among those infected."

Authorities arrested two people including a woman who allegedly lured the victim to Mexico for the kidnapping.

New information revealed that a firefighter from Los Angeles who had been kidnapped in Mexico in late August was killed and his remains charred in an attempt to dispose of the body, officials in Mexico reported. This week, the Baja California Attorney General’s Office reported they discovered the remains of 48-year-old Frank Aguilar Cornejo in the beach resort city of Rosarito. According to El Imparcial, the remains had been charred in an attempt to dispose of the body. Investigators are conducting forensic and DNA testing.

As Breitbart Texas reported, Aguilar Cornejo went missing in late August while staying at his beach house in Rosarito. The case garnered the attention of the FBI who was in contact with Mexican authorities during the investigation. The most recent information released by the Baja California AG’s Office points to Aguilar going to meet a woman named Fanny “N.” She, with the help of Santos “N” and a third suspect still on the run, attempted to kidnap the firefighter. During the attempt, the suspects shot and killed Aguilar Cornejo. They drove the body to a location off South Boulevard 2000 in Rosarito where they tried to incinerate the remains.

According to El Imparcial, on October 9, authorities arrested Fanny and Santos on “forced disappearance” charges. A Mexican judge ruled the arrest illegal and ordered their release. Authorities obtained a second arrest warrant on kidnapping charges and have been able to hold the two since that time.

Agents assigned to the Laredo North Border Patrol station shortly after midnight on November 6 received a call for assistance from the Laredo, Texas, Police Department. Agents responded to the location and found an abandoned tractor-trailer parked on a side street in front of a local business, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents heard noises coming from inside the locked trailer. Laredo police officers broke the seal on the rear of the trailer and opened the door. Inside were 76 migrants who had been locked inside with no means of escape and limited air circulation. None of the 67 migrants work masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, photographs of the scene revealed.

67 people illegally present in the U.S., were discovered inside this latched tractor trailer parked outside of a nearby business. This callous and dangerous act is another example of the lack of regard human smugglers have for those they exploit for profit. https://t.co/aTgMpnZz99 — Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak (@USBPChiefLRT) November 6, 2020

Agents conducted immigration interviews and initial medical screenings. The agents determine all 67 to be in good health, officials reported. The interviews identified all 67 to be illegal aliens from Mexico and Guatemala, officials reported.

“Strong partnerships between law enforcement agencies keeps our community safe and saves lives. I commend these Laredo Police Department officers for their quick response and diligence in locating this vehicle and helping stop another dangerous human smuggling case,” said Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak in a written statement.

Agents arrested the 67 migrants and seized the tractor-trailer.

Under Title 42 coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all 67 will likely be returned to Mexico.

The Chinese national has a violent criminal history and an outstanding order of removal from an immigration judge.

Houlton Station Border Patrol agents working the border near Bangor, Maine, on November 2 encountered a suspicious vehicle with Massachusetts plates. The agents ran a records check on the vehicle and discovered it belonged to a previously deported Chinese national. The man reportedly has an extensive criminal history,

Records warned agents the subject should be considered to be armed and dangerous. His criminal history includes convictions for Larceny, robbery, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Border Patrol agents arrested the Chinese man and transferred him to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers who will process him for removal to China.

The agents from Maine kept a dangerous criminal alien from remaining in the U.S. where he could be a threat to American citizens.

It is not clear if the U.S. Attorney’s Office will seek to prosecute the violent previously deported illegal alien for illegal re-entry after removal. If prosecuted and convicted, the man could face up to 20 years in federal prison.

Breitbart Texas reports extensively on the arrest by Border Patrol agents of previously deported criminal aliens. These often include previously deported sex offenders including child sex offenders and rapists.

In many cases, previously deported illegal aliens are simply returned to Mexico or Canada under Title 42 coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This protocol allows most migrants to be expelled from the U.S. within two hours to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The seizures came in two failed drug-trafficking events at the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge.

CBP officers assigned to the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge on October 30 observed a Toyota Sequoia approaching for entry into the United States, according to information recently released by CBP officials in South Texas. The officers referred the driver to a secondary inspection area for further investigation.

A secondary inspection led to the discovery of 24 packages of drugs, officials reported. Officers test the drugs and identified them as 1167.77 pounds of methamphetamine. The drug shipment has an estimated street value of $3,355,500, officials reported.

Officers arrested the driver, a 23-year-old male Legal Permanent Resident living in Edinburg, Texas. They seized the drugs and the vehicle.

A second incident occurred on the same bridge the following day, officials reported. Officer observed a Hyundai Elantra approaching from Mexico for entry into the U.S. Officers referred the driver, a 62-year-old female U.S. citizen from Rio Grande City, Texas, to the secondary inspection area.

A search of her vehicle led to the discovery of three packages containing cocaine. Officials weighed the drugs at 7.14 pounds and reported the estimated street value to be about $55,000.

CBP officers utilized non-intrusive imaging systems and K-9s trained to detect drugs to screen the vehicles prior to physical inspections.

“These are great interceptions of hard narcotics that our officers accomplished due to outstanding teamwork, resiliency and commitment towards our mission of keeping dangerous drugs from crossing our border and entering into our communities,” said Port Director Carlos Rodriguez, Hidalgo/Pharr/Anzalduas Port of Entry.

CBP officers turned both subjects and the drugs over to ICE Homeland Security Investigations for further investigation into drug trafficking charges.

Defense Secretary’s U.S. Arrest,"The Mexican government ordered its top military officials to remain silent regarding the recent arrest of a former secretary of defense by the U.S. on drug trafficking charges.

Former Secretary of Defense Salvador Cienfuegos is currently in U.S. custody after pleading not guilty to drug trafficking charges on Thursday. U.S. authorities arrested Mexico’s former top military official last month when he landed in California for a vacation. Cienfuegos led Mexico’s military and counter-cartels efforts during the administration of former President Enrique Pena Nieto. U.S. prosecutors claim that while supposedly fighting cartels, Cienfuegos was actually a drug lord himself, nicknamed “El Padrino or Godfather” who protected a faction of the Beltran Leyva Cartel called “H2.” The arrest sent shockwaves through Mexico’s government, leading to speculation about which public official will be named next.

Breitbart Texas obtained a copy of a letter that Mexico’s Defense Ministry issued to all of its top military officials, ordering them to not make any statements “particularly to the press” about Cienfuegos’ arrest.

The letter was distributed on October 27, days after Cienfuegos’s highly publicized arrest. Officials are notified to keep silent about the case.

While Cienfuegos is not part of the current administration led by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), he along with his top government officials recently voiced outrage at having been left out of the loop which has caused diplomatic tensions. The arrest also raised a cloud of corruption over Mexico’s military. That perception comes as AMLO uses the military as the backbone of many of his projects, including the development of key infrastructure.

In an effort to be respectful to the process, he will wait until all legal matters are resolved before congratulating the winner.

During a news conference on Saturday night, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the establishment rushing to steal an election is exactly what happened to him during his failed 2006 presidential election.

“In regards to the elections in the United States, we will wait for the legal issues to be resolved,” Lopez Obrador said. “We don’t want to be imprudent, we don’t want to act lightly and we want to be respectful … of foreign law.”

According to AMLO, during his 2006 presidential bid, the establishment rushed to declare former President Felipe Calderon the winner and the president of Spain at the time was quick to congratulate him before votes had been counted.

“That was an imprudence and we do not want to do that.”

AMLO claimed to have a good relationship with both candidates and that ten years ago he met Democratic candidate Joseph Biden for the first time.

“I presented him a letter at the time about our movement and our struggle,” he said. “We spoke about immigration and other matters. There are no bad relations here.”

AMLO also said that he has had a good working relationship with current President Donald J. Trump.

“President Trump has been very respectful with us and we have achieved very good accords,” he said. “We thank him for not having been a meddler and he has respected us … we have no quarrels with any of them.”

Michoacán Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo posted a video on Twitter where he called on “paisanos and paisanas” to vote for Biden, claiming President Donald Trump hates migrants. In early 2018, Nicolas “El Gordo” Sierra, the leader of Los Viagras Cartel, claimed Aureoles paid large sums of money to cartels to generate votes.

Mexico’s Secretary of the Interior Olga Sanchez Cordero scolded Aureoles through a hand-delivered letter with copies sent to the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Mexico’s Attorney General, and other officials. Cordero told Aureoles Conejo that Mexican law prohibited international election interference. Relations are to be maintained at federal levels, the letter explained. Mexico’s federal government posted the letter online.

Hours after the public scolding, the governor took to social media again to share a tweet by Biden, where he called on paisanos and paisanas to “vote for love and unity and not hate and division.”

A nuestros paisanos y paisanas que están en EUA, reitero mi llamado a votar por la unidad y el amor, no por el odio y la división; denle voz a la dignidad de México. https://t.co/C5H7h5uJzp — Silvano Aureoles (@Silvano_A) October 31, 2020

Mexico’s federal government has not responded to questions from Breitbart Texas about Aureoles Conejo and whether he will face any further consequences.

Biden lost more counties than almost any Democrat candidate in Texas’s history, according to a political consultant interviewed by Breitbart News.

Statewide, Biden only won 21 of the Lone Star State’s 254 counties — 12 of these in the state’s border region.

“There is a systematic bias in the Democrat world that pigeonholes people into voting certain ways,” Dave Carney, chief political consultant for Texas Governor Greg Abbott, told Breitbart Texas Wednesday afternoon. “There is a belief that if more Latinos voted, more Democrats would get elected.”

Tuesday, more people, including Texas Hispanics, voted and yet, Republicans continued to win. Results for Republicans actually improved in many counties south of San Antonio, Carney explained.

In 20 Texas counties located on or near the state’s border with Mexico, President Donald Trump won eight, according to numbers widely reported on the day after the presidential election. This is up from only three counties won by the 2016 Trump campaign. While these counties that run from Brownsville to El Paso remained predominantly Democrat, President Trump increased his number of votes in 19 of the 20 counties. He only lost ground in El Paso County when compared to 2016 results.

In contrast, Joe Biden’s numbers only increased in seven of the 20 counties and dropped in 13 counties.

Statewide, Biden only won 21 of the Lone Star State’s 254 counties — 12 of these in the state’s border region.

President Trump mobilized Texas voters in this region by delivering on his promises regarding economic growth and border security, Carney said.

“Trump’s performance with Latino voters was impressive,” Carney stated. “In many counties, he doubled his 2016 turnout.”

More people voted, he said, and Texas is redder than before.

The counties surveyed include, in no particular order, Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Zapata, Webb, Willacy, Kenedy, Brooks, Jim Hogg, Dimmit, Maverick, Presidio, Val Verde, Brewster, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Terrell, Kinney, and El Paso.

Texas Democrats promised 2020 would be the year Texas turned blue, the Texas Tribune reported on Wednesday.

“But 2020 proved another disappointment for the state’s minority party as Republicans remained dominant in Texas, appearing poised to maintain victories in all statewide offices and both chambers of the Legislature,” the Texas news outlet reported. “In what has become a familiar refrain, Texas Democrats pointed to 2020’s narrow losses as symbolic victories — signs that the state will one day change in their favor.”

Dave Carney, chief political consultant for Texas Governor Greg Abbott, told reporters in a conference call that “Democrats over-promised and under-performed” in the 2020 General Election. He called their performance the “worst caucus campaign ever.”

The campaign to replace the Republican majority in the Texas House drew more than $30 million from outside the state, Carney stated. Despite this massive influx, Democrats did not flip a single seat as of this writing.

Texas Democrats did not describe their loss as a disappointment, the Tribune reported. Instead, they called their losses “hopeful omens for next time.”

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo was more direct in his reaction to the statewide losses.

“Texas Democrats can thank ‘socialist democrats and defund the police crowd’ led by @GregCasar, @JimmyFlannigan and the rest of the Austin City Council,” Acevedo tweeted. “Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism.”

Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism. — Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) November 4, 2020

Carney said Governor Abbott’s political campaign spent $6 million to help protect the House Republican majority. The campaign identified key districts and issues for those voters and developed ads to focus on the issues important to those voters, he explained.

Carney said Texas voters soundly rejected the message delivered by failed senate and presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. “That just doesn’t sell in Texas,” Carney said.

Instead, he said, Texas Republicans focused on recruiting “real candidates” and focused on “real issues.” He said Republicans recruited the most female candidates and most minority candidates.

In addition to keeping their majority in the Texas House, Republicans also maintained control of the Texas Senate, the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Railroad Commission.

U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) won in his re-election campaign against Democrat MJ Hegar by more than 10 points.

The promised flipping of Texas into the blue column for Joe Biden also failed to materialize. President Donald Trump carried the Lone Star State.

Republican control of the Texas Legislature allows the party to continue to direct important issues during the upcoming session. Those include redistricting, law enforcement, criminal justice reform, property taxes, and other issues voted on by Texas voters. Legislators will also be selecting a new Speaker of the House during the opening of the 2021 legislative session.

The Mexican politician is the second to make a social media appeal favoring Biden in recent days in contrast to local law.

In recent days, San Pedro Mayor Miguel Bernardo Trevino de Hoyos used Instagram to publish posts asking his followers to vote for Biden. “If you vote for Trump I will take it as a personal offense,” Trevino scolds.

The politician also posted a photo from an article in The Economist titled “Why it has to be Joe Biden.“

Trevino is the second Mexican politician who openly called for those living in the U.S. to vote for Biden. Mexico’s Secretary of the Interior Olga Sanchez Cordero recently sent a reprimand to Michoacán Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo, who posted a video asking for people from his state to vote Democrat, claiming Trump hates migrants. In the reprimand, Cordero said that the comments went against Mexico’s law of not interfering in another country’s politics, adding that international relations are to be maintained at federal levels. Mexico’s federal government posted the letter online. Even after the letter went public, Aureoles Conejo continued to ask his followers to vote for Biden.

Trevino has become a controversial figure in Nuevo Leon, where he routinely boasts about the effectiveness of his local police force. Law enforcement reports obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that for a long time, his department has been deeply infiltrated by operators loyal to FBI Most Wanted fugitive Jose Rodolfo “El Gato” Villarreal.

Villarreal is wanted by U.S. authorities for a cartel execution in Southlake, Texas. Though he is a top fugitive, El Gato operates drug trafficking, extortion, and money laundering operations in San Pedro.

In the video, residents of an apartment complex located directly above the Starbucks can be seen looking out the window as the potential arson developed.

The sheriff’s office report states:

The group continued moving west on SW Montgomery St. Individuals focused on the Starbucks located in the ground floor of an apartment building on Montgomery St. People broke windows and entered the business. At about 9:15 p.m., the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, Portland Police Bureau and Oregon State Police operating under a unified command structure declared the gathering an unlawful assembly due to criminal activity occurring and ordered individuals to disperse. During the response, officers interrupted a possible arson attempt. Officers found a flammable liquid spread throughout the inside of the business.

Police arrived before the rioters could ignite the flammable liquid found throughout the inside of the vandalized Starbucks, officials reported.

Another video shows apartment residents looking down on the scene.

Police moved in and moved the rioters away from the building.

Police declared the assembly due to vandalism and “gasoline left inside Starbucks.”

Rio Grande City Border Patrol agents responded to a group of people in an area well-known for human smuggling. As one of the agents arrived on scene, he observed two people fleeing into the brush near the Rio Grande, according to information provided by Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agent found the two men hiding in the brush. Suddenly, one of the men became combative and attacked the lone agent. He managed to gain control of the agent’s ECW and struck the agent several times in the face and head. The attack caused multiple lacerations, officials stated.

Officials said the “suspected illegal alien” fled after the Border Patrol agent regained control of the ECW.

The late commander received several threats by organized crime prior to his execution.

The murder took place on Saturday morning in the Tamaulipas capital city of Ciudad Victoria. Commander Tomas Charles Ortiz and his brother Alejandro pulled up to a pharmacy in the bureaucrat’s neighborhood. An unknown number of gunmen went up to the duo and shot them several times with handguns before escaping. Residents called 911 to report the murder. State investigators responded to the scene and sealed the area as they carried out the preliminary investigations.

Tomas Charles Ortiz had served as the Tamaulipas State Police Delegate in Reynosa and had been in charge of overseeing numerous operations by state police officers. A motive for the murder has not been revealed. Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that one of the main investigation theories points to gunmen from the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas. In recent days, state authorities seized several weapons and armored vehicles from cartel gunmen in the area known as La Riberena that is located immediately south of Starr County, Texas.

Breitbart Texas reported that the area has been the source of much conflict as the CDN worked to systematically take away control of that region from the Gulf Cartel. The region is one of the main smuggling areas in Tamaulipas since it has approximately 43 miles of unfenced border area where the only obstacle for cartel smugglers is the shallow waters of the Rio Grande.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

The murder comes as Mexican government officials continue their claim that safety in Mexico is improving.

The murder took place on Thursday night in Ciudad Juarez when two gunmen shot and killed Arturo Alba Medina. The journalist works as the local anchor for the Multimedios TV station. His murder took place shortly around 10 p.m. after the journalists finished his nightly newscast. Two gunmen ambushed him as he drove near the Hidalgo neighborhood. Local news outlets claim the gunmen shot the journalist at least 11 times. Information released by the Chihuahua Attorney General’s Office indicated the gunmen used two different weapons for the murder.

Alba Medina, 49, was a long-time journalist in Ciudad Juarez and also worked at a local university. In the aftermath of the journalist’s murder, the state governor and city officials took to social media to voice their concerns about the case.

Lamento y condeno el cobarde asesinato del periodista y conductor de @Multimediosjuar, Arturo Alba Medina en #CdJuárez, también vocero del @InstitutoTecno4. He instruido a la @FiscaliaNorte para que se haga una investigación exhaustiva y den con los responsables. Se hará justicia — Javier Corral Jurado (@Javier_Corral) October 30, 2020

Medina’s murder is the sixth murder of a journalist in Mexico this year. According to various international press freedom groups, Mexico is considered one of the most dangerous places for journalists to work. In the state of Chihuahua, there have been 23 murdered journalists since 2000.

According to various reports from the Committee to Protect Journalists, one of the alarming trends in Mexico deals with the high level of impunity when it comes to crimes against journalists. They claim most cases of aggression and murders against journalists go unpunished.

The agents described the benefit to Hispanic communities across the country.

In a series of videos, both in English and Spanish shared on Twitter, officials with National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) provided a glimpse into their personal experiences as Border Patrol agents and voiced their support for U.S. President Donald Trump.

In one of the videos, NBPC Vice-President Art Del Cueto said that the Latino community has flourished under Trump’s immigration policies.

“We’ve had the highest average annual income among Latino communities and minorities,” Del Cueto said. “The lowest unemployment rate among Latino communities and minorities.”

In another video, NBPC member Maria Salcido said she was a mother of four and the daughter of legal immigrants. In her video, Salcido said her relatives supported her career in law enforcement.

“They understand that rule of law keeps the Latino community safe,”

NBPC member Gabriel Class said he was the son of an African American mother and a Puerto Rican father. “In New York, I personally witnessed the negative effects of illegal immigration,” Class said.

The case of Luciano Leal Garza signifies the wave of violence attributed to the two main factions of the Gulf Cartel in northern Tamaulipas. The gunmen lured Luciano to the plaza square in the farming community of San Fernando, where he thought he was going to meet a girl. The teen’s family is known in the region for owning several legitimate businesses.

Breitbart Texas reported on Luciano’s kidnapping in August after relatives grew increasingly desperate for public help. The cartel kidnappers demanded $100,000 USD. The family was unable to pay the full amount despite efforts to meet the ransom. Although the relatives contacted authorities soon after the abduction, the boy’s parents initiated their own investigation.

The parents were able to learn that the kidnapping was carried out by the Gulf Cartel in San Fernando under orders of local plaza boss Guadalupe “El Camaron” Flores Silguero. Erick Gamaliel Garza and Ubaldo Garza allegedly took the boy. The kidnapping was greenlit by regional Gulf Cartel boss Carlos “El Pawa” De La Cruz, according to the family.

On September 11, Tamaulipas state authorities arrested El Camaron, but refused to talk. Authorities were not able to move forward with the case. Desperate relatives began to hold protests and rallies to pressure officials to ask for answers.

The break in the case came on October 15, when Tamaulipas state police arrested Erick Gamaliel Garza in Matamoros. During questioning, Gamaliel told authorities that Luciano was dead and led them to an abandoned suitcase in San Fernando. The teen’s remains were found stashed.

San Fernando has a long history of terror at the hands of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Violence spiked after the now rival cartels fractured in late 2009. Since then, the Zeta faction in San Fernando has rejoined with the Gulf Cartel, while others remain violently splintered. In 2010, Los Zetas murdered 72 migrants who were trying to reach the U.S. border. A few months later in 2011, authorities began unearthing dozens of mass graves in ranches around San Fernando. State authorities at the time stopped searching after finding 193 bodies. Los Zetas and the Gulf are linked to countless murders and kidnappings where they target innocent farmers, ranchers, and business leaders.

An innocent bystander was seriously injured in crossfire. The gunmen are part of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas. At least two of the dead gunmen are believed to be current Mexican Army soldiers or deserters.

The two shootouts took place on the south side of the city. While Mexico’s federal government has not released any information, military sources shared some information with Breitbart Texas.

The shootouts began when a group of soldiers patrolling the streets of Nuevo Laredo encountered gunmen who started firing to cover their escape. The gunmen climbed into a Ford Raptor with Texas license plates as they sped off. The military forces requested backup and gave chase, reaching them near the Longoria neighborhood. Authorities described the gunmen as four aged 20 years or younger, while one of them was roughly 50-years-old. All wore military-style clothing with CDN-branded body armor.

Soon after the first shootout, military forces clashed with a second SUV full of gunmen along the highway that connects Nuevo Laredo with Monterrey. The gunmen were riding in a 2007 GMC Sierra also with Texas plates. The gunmen fired at the military forces as they tried to flee, but crashed into an innocent motorist. A 34-year-old woman was caught in the crossfire and needed immediate medical attention after being struck by shrapnel in her face and eye. The troops were able to kill five additional gunmen in military-style uniforms with CDN body armor.

Through a video posted on Twitter, Michoacán Governor Silvano Aureoles asked “paisanas and paisanos” in the U.S. to vote in support of Biden, claiming that President Donald Trump hates migrants.

Mensaje a nuestras paisanas y paisanos con motivo de las próximas elecciones presidenciales en EUA. pic.twitter.com/VcxEebViM8 — Silvano Aureoles (@Silvano_A) October 29, 2020

“This November 3, the U.S. is having elections that are determining for you who live and work and have family on the other side,” Aureoles said. “You have an opportunity to choose a humanitarian government with a different approach that knows and understands the needs of migrants.”

According to Aureoles, there are more than 4 million with roots from Michoacán living in the U.S. and he called on those with voting rights to give voice to those “living in the shadows.”

“While Donald Trump builds walls to stop migrants and separates families, and promotes hate and racism against those who need to go to the other side [of the border],” Aureoles said. “At the same time, he only benefits the rich.”

In the video, Aureoles praised comments made by Biden about providing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

“On the contrary, the candidate to replace him is pushing an agenda that carries a lot to the historic hopes and dreams of the migrant community through a naturalization program,” Aureoles said. “[Biden] has a vision for all Americans–even for those who don’t yet have papers.”

Aureoles has been a controversial figure since taking office due to the raging violence in his state where large swaths remain under the control of cartels. The escalating turf wars have led to mass kidnappings without any real response by authorities. In early 2018, Nicolas “El Gordo” Sierra, the leader of Los Viagras Cartel, claimed Aureoles paid large sums of money to cartels to generate votes.

Police intervened and made arrests on the scene.

A Twitter video shows protesters in the lobby of KING5 NBC Seattle on Thursday evening. Protesters expressed outrage about the television news station reporting the news of rioters being arrested.

A Seattle police officer can be seen calling for backup as the situation appears to become more intense.

One woman bemoans the news station’s reporting the public information of people who are being arrested during protests and riots in the Seattle area.

“They did an investigation and they’re doxing protesters,” the woman yells into the news station’s lobby. “They need to dox the police officers that kill people.”

She then yelled about the officer threatening to arrest her (for trespassing).

The next Twitter video shows police arresting one man in the lobby of the station after apparently moving protesters out onto the sidewalk.

“He was sitting down,” a woman yelled as officers put the subject into the police car in handcuffs. The man allegedly refused to leave the lobby of the TV station after being warned about trespassing. “He was sitting! He never said a f*cking word.”

Officials report the U.S. citizen woman attempted to use her teen son to smuggle methamphetamine and fentanyl into Texas.

CBP Office of Field Operations officers assigned to the Ysleta Port of Entry in El Paso on October 21 observed a vehicle approaching from Mexico for entry into the United States. Officers selected the vehicle for a random secondary inspection, according to information obtained from El Paso CBP officials.

During the secondary inspection, officers noted the 31-year-old U.S. citizen female was traveling with her three children — ages 13, 12, and 5, officials reported.

A search by a CBP K-9 resulted in an alert due to an odor it is trained to detect coming from the front passenger seat. The 13-year-old boy occupied that seat, the report indicates. Officers searched the boy and found a “square-shaped item” protruding from his back. The package contained multiple bundles of drugs that were taped to the boy’s body.

Officers tested and weighed the drugs. They confirmed 2.25 pounds of methamphetamine and 1.1 pounds of highly dangerous fentanyl.

Officers arrested the woman and turned the children over to another family member. The mother faces federal charges for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine and fentanyl into the United States. It is not known if Texas CPS will get involved.

“Smugglers will use any method they can to attempt to smuggle drugs,” said CBP Ysleta Port Director Arnoldo Gomez, “Unfortunately, in this case, a mother used her 13-year-old son in her attempt to deceive CBP Officers.”

Secretary of Defense,"Mexico’s top diplomat publicly shared that his country’s government is “profoundly upset” after the DEA arrested a former secretary of defense for drug charges without official warning.

During a news conference, Mexican Foreign Relations Minister Marcelo Ebrard said he expressed discontent toward the U.S. Ebrard claimed that U.S. diplomats had told him they could not release information about the sealed grand jury indictment. The diplomat expressed his unhappiness anyway. The official added that Mexico’s government was ready to provide consular assistance to the jailed general.

Earlier this month, the DEA arrested General Salvador “El Padrino” Cienfuegos on drug charges–alleging he worked with and provided official protection to members of the Beltran Leyva Cartel (aka “H2”). Authorities arrested Cienfuegos as he landed in California. A federal judge ruled he will be held without bond.

The arrest sent shockwaves throughout Mexico. Cienfuegos served under former President Enrique Pena Nieto from a rival party to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). Cienfuegos is the second top official to face arrest in recent months. In December 2019, U.S. authorities arrested Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico’s former Public Security Secretary, on drug charges. While Garcia Luna and Cienfuegos did not serve under AMLO, their arrests reinforce the perception of corruption at the highest levels in Mexico City.

The latest arrest is still a headache for AMLO as his administration relies heavily on the military to address cartel and public security issues.

Recently, Tamaulipas state police in Reynosa and in Ciudad Camargo seized armored vehicles as violence in these border regions continues. Officers patrolling in Ciudad Camargo, just south of Rio Grande City, Texas, spotted a gunman who began shooting at them and then ran away into the brush. As police officers rushed to the scene, they found armored vehicles. Inside, police found an explosive device, bulletproof vests, ammunition, and other tactical gear.

In a separate case, gunmen from the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel clashed with Tamaulipas police in the city’s Loma Real neighborhood. Police chased gunmen in a white late-model GMC Sierra that was part of a convoy. A few blocks further, the gunmen left their weapons and the SUV and ran into a neighborhood to hide.

Armored SUVs are now a common tool used by cartel gunmen during their frequent clashes in Tamaulipas. Quite often, gunmen are better equipped than state police–causing a dispute between federal and state officials since Mexico’s recently established National Guard is accused of not taking an active role in fighting cartels.
