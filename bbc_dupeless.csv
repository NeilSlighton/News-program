The Brazilian clinical trial for a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine has been suspended after health authorities reported a ""severe adverse"" incident.

Brazilian health regulator Anvisa said the incident took place on 29 October, but did not give further details.

The CoronaVac vaccine, developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, is one of several in final-stage testing globally.

Sinovac says it is ""confident in the safety of the vaccine"".

The firm has already been using it to immunise thousands of people at home in an emergency use programme.

Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by coronavirus, recording more than 5.6m confirmed cases - the third highest tally in the world after the US and India - and nearly 163,000 deaths so far, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.

Why was the trial halted?

On Monday Anvisa said it had ""ruled to interrupt the clinical trial of the CoronaVac vaccine after a serious adverse incident"".

It did not reveal what happened, nor where it took place. Late-stage trials for the Sinovac vaccine are also being conducted in Indonesia and Turkey, but neither of these countries have announced a suspension.

Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said on Tuesday that its own Sinovac vaccine trials were ""going smoothly"", according to Reuters news agency.

Dimas Covas, the head of Butantan, the medical research institute conducting the Brazilian trial, told local media that the trial's suspension was related to a death. However, he insisted that the death was not related to the vaccine, Reuters said.

Sinovac said on Tuesday that it was communicating with Brazil about the reported incident.

""We learned the head of Butantan Institute believed that this serious adverse event (SAE) is not related to the vaccine,"" it said in a statement. ""The clinical study in Brazil is strictly carried out in accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) requirements and we are confident in the safety of the vaccine.""

Butantan has said it will hold a news conference on Tuesday at 11:00 local time (14:00 GMT).

A pause in a clinical trial is not unusual. In September, the UK paused trials for another Covid-19 vaccine after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction.

The trials for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University were resumed a few days later after regulators said it was safe to continue.

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been open about his preference for the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, saying his government would not buy a Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccine.

Where are we in the search for a vaccine?

CoronaVac is one of around a dozen vaccines in the final stage of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - around the world.

This is a crucial point in vaccine development, where some experimental vaccines will fail.

The news of its suspension in Brazil came shortly after a rival vaccine developer, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, said its own vaccine candidate had shown 90% effectiveness.

Last month the Oxford vaccine trial reviewed the death of a volunteer in Brazil, saying an assessment had revealed no safety concerns.

How has China used experimental vaccines?

Separate to the phase 3 trials being held overseas, China is also administering experimental Covid-19 vaccines at home.

CoronaVac is among three experimental coronavirus vaccines China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use programme.

Last month the BBC filmed hundreds of people in the city of Yiwu queuing to get the vaccine after authorities approved the distribution to anyone who wanted the injection.

A businessman who is due to have the second of the required two jabs imminently told the BBC that he would go ahead with it, adding that it is ""worth it considering the high infection rate abroad"".

Sinovac has previously said almost all of its employees and their families have received the vaccine."

Nigeria's Minister of Transport, Chibuike Amaechi, has dismissed allegations that the country offered its sovereignty as collateral when signing a $400m (£300m) loan with China.

The loan agreement - signed in 2014 with China's Export-Import Bank - contained a clause about Nigeria waiving its immunity on sovereignty if it defaults on repayment.

Lawmakers had questioned the intent of the clause and many in the country speculated that it had conceded the country's sovereignty to China, but Mr Amacehi has told the BBC that is not the case.

""The [Chinese] are saying that if we are unable to pay then we should go to court according to the agreement,"" he said.

He accused the country's main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), of misinterpreting the clause to mean that the Chinese would appoint administrators to govern Nigeria if the country was unable to repay the loan."

But what about the Isles of Scilly? This cluster of islands 28 miles off Cornwall’s tip is where some believe the legendary English king is buried, on the site of his final battle with Mordred in the 6th Century. That was in the mythical land of Lyonesse – a flooded country stretching west from Cornwall whose submerged peaks are believed by some to be the Isles of Scilly.

Scilly is an otherworldly, offbeat place

Indeed there are tombs on the islands that date back millennia, and these once-lavish chambers would have been more than fitting for a fabled chieftain. But the likelihood Arthur ever lay in them (if he even existed) is very small. In fact, the legend yoking him to Scilly is much more recent – it’s the work of Alfred Lord Tennyson. The Victorian poet visited the islands on holiday with friends and was so smitten with the landscape, which he thought evocative of a simpler, pre-industrial time, that he co-opted the archipelago as a romantic backdrop when he dashed off his tribute to Arthur, Idylls of the King. This blockbuster piece of populist poetry brought the idea of Lyonesse to wider audiences, while simultaneously cementing its association with Scilly.

Frankly, it’s a shame to know those stories are likely nonsense as you arrive in Scilly. Flying in, the 145-island archipelago resembles dribbles of pancake batter flicked haphazardly onto a hot pan – or in this case, the sea. The tiny, oddly shaped islands shimmer into view almost unexpectedly, hovering on the edge of the modern world, like a real-life Brigadoon. Indeed, ask most Britons about them, and they’ll pause slightly, puzzled, before a flicker of recognition and a smile, much as you would remembering a distant relative you wish you knew better. And with good reason: Scilly is an otherworldly, offbeat place, somewhere it’s easy to imagine, as Tennyson did, King Arthur roaming the hills.

Strolling around Scilly after landing at the airport is like stepping into not-quite Britain

Strolling around Scilly after landing at the airport is like stepping into not-quite Britain. Just five of its islands are now inhabited, though you’ll spot relics of former settlements on several others. Outside one store there’s a chalkboard on which the high tides and wind directions for the day are scrawled; after all, locals commute between islands by boat and need to plan ahead so they’re not marooned by the tides. Most of the houses are small, neat old fishermen’s cottages with tidy hedges in the front garden – not boxwood or yew, though, but supersized succulents that thrive, Triffid-style, thanks to the Mediterranean-like weather here. On Scilly, it’s as if the rules and laws of the rest of the UK seem not to apply, or at least only with an asterisk or two.

That’s certainly what Colin Taylor found when he moved here to be a policeman. Taylor stayed for almost a decade and wrote a memoir documenting his experiences, The Life of a Scilly Sergeant. In it, he wrote about run-ins with burglars who left fried eggs as their calling card, or a short-sighted horse that was wrecking local cars. Taylor discovered the islands much as Tennyson did, when he decided to visit on his honeymoon.

“I said, ‘Let’s go and find this mythical place which is Scilly’,” Taylor told me. Quickly smitten with the quirky way of life, he moved here – only to find himself in an unexpected position: several close encounters with Prince Charles, when the heir apparent flew into the islands and Taylor formed part of the team tasked with guiding and protecting him.

Scilly – call it that, or the Isles of Scilly, but never the Scillies, or the locals will scoff – is part of the Duchy of Cornwall, a centuries-old fiefdom currently under the stewardship of the Prince of Wales. The Duchy supplies Charles with much of his personal income; in 2020, that was £22.2m. Those earnings include rents from almost every hectare of Scilly. Aside from a small patch of Hugh Town, the capital on the main island of St Mary’s, there’s no freeholds here; no resident owns their house outright, but rather rents or leases it from the Prince. To move, people must petition the Duchy, explaining why they need more space, then wait patiently until a potential new home becomes vacant and is offered to them.

The locals, even in Hugh Town, don’t bristle at the system, though. Mention Prince Charles to most and they’ll shift slightly, lips tightening, ready to defend him against outsiders.

“People might say ‘Bloody Duchy!’,” newsagent and newspaper publisher Clive Mumford told me, sitting in his book-strewn study on the main street. “But I look at it differently. If all land and property was freehold, the whole place would be wrecked overnight. It’s anachronistic, but it’s a buffer against overdevelopment.”

The fondness is mutual: Prince Charles visits most years and brought Princess Diana here several times, including a memorable visit with their young sons in 1989. Locals will still proudly tell you that paparazzi who hired boats to spy on the family found themselves taken out to the wrong islands by protective fishermen. This summer, when the pandemic nudged the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to holiday domestically with their kids, they chose to return with their own children. William and Kate didn’t stay at Charles’ private home on St Mary’s, though – Tamarisk, a cottage that is now available for rent via the Duchy – but rather at another of the Scillonian houses earmarked for the prince’s personal use on a different island: Tresco.

Scilly has startling communalities to the Galapagos Islands

Tresco is yet another Scillonian anomaly. Rather than a single house, the entire island is on long-term lease from the Duchy to an aristocratic British family. They first took it over in the 1830s when the ancestor of the current leaseholder, Robert Dorrien-Smith, came here with a fortune and a mind to transform what was then one of the poorest corners of the British Isles.

“He was a philanthropist, and he was looking for somewhere he could try out an experiment, mainly with education, and wanted to find a community where he could rule it,” said Richard Larn, the islands’ foremost historian who also leads tours around the islands. That do-gooder, Augustus Smith, funded universal schooling for children up to age 11 on the islands – a first in England.

Smith had other interests, too, in particular gardening. Because Scilly’s flora and fauna are cut off from the mainland, it has startling communalities to the Galapagos Islands, more than 6,000 miles away. Despite the fact it’s so close to mainland Cornwall, wind and water patterns keep the archipelago isolated from incoming animals, plants and even infections (Indeed, the archipelago remained Covid-19-free until late September, when it detected its first – and so far only – non-lethal case). The native Scilly bee remains free from any of the viruses that threaten bee survival elsewhere and is one of several endemic species on the archipelago, such as the Scilly shrew (Once considered a sub-species of the lesser white-toothed shrew, thanks to its darker fur and unusual beach habitat, it’s now often lumped in with that overall group). Such isolation also means that plants and animals under threat elsewhere can be preserved here. Ash trees thrive unravaged by dieback, and elms are free from disease. Native British red squirrels, which have largely been elbowed out by imported greys on the mainland, have a haven on Scilly, too.

“There are no predators, so they’re quite tame,” said head gardener Andrew Lawson as he stood in the middle of the Tresco Abbey Garden, surveying it proudly. The 17-acre oasis has been Lawson’s turf for more than 30 years, and he works closely with the Dorrien-Smith family to maintain this ecological Eden of 20,000 plants from more than 80 countries.

Lawson is tanned from those decades spent outdoors, his face lined from the sun – an unexpected danger in the UK, perhaps. But Scilly’s weather is also quirky: relentlessly, un-Britishly sunny, it averages 7.6 hours of sunshine per day in July, almost two hours more than London. The weather pattern is the result of lying under the path of the warming winds of the Gulf Stream; they also ensure that it’s rarely frosty in winter – a boon for the Tresco Abbey Garden. If only the Gulf Stream had an effect on the waters here too; though bright blue and pollution free, pause before plunging in. Even on a hot summer day, expect them to be bracing, as they rush in from the Atlantic and remain ice-cold year-round as a result.

The weather, of course, has helped burnish the islands’ reputation as a tourist spot; it also provided the archipelago’s main industry before tourism boomed in the last few decades. Back in the late 19th Century, an enterprising local farmer sent some narcissus flowers to a London market in early spring – see, he said, how much sooner flowers bloom in Scilly. There was a frenzied positive reaction, which helped flower farms and bulbs became the islands’ core industry for several decades. Even now, after globalisation upended the economics of that business, there are around two dozen flower farms still in operation – most of them on St Marys and a few on the northernmost inhabited island, St Martin. Walk around St Martin in the spring, as I did, and you’ll see wildflowers peeking through the grassy slopes.

Close to St Martin are the uninhabited Eastern Isles. Excavations have revealed that Britons called this tiny cluster of islets home in the Bronze and Iron Ages, and a Roman shrine has even been unearthed here, showing the length of habitation. Back then, though, these islets would have been far larger and likely connected to most of the other landmasses – much of what’s now Scilly would have been a single, unnamed island in prehistoric times. They were separated only as sea levels rose; indeed, the harbour on the main island of St Mary’s came into use after the waters rose again in the 1550s and made it viable for shipping.

Even now, during low tides, you can wade between several of the islands. Seeing that, it’s easy to see how Tennyson was inspired to suggest Scilly was once Lyonesse as Taylor explained to me.

“On a really, really low tide, you can see for miles and miles, including all the jagged rocks and peaks that would normally be under the weather and the field systems and walls that vanished when they flooded,” he said, “It’s just like you’ve revealed an Arthurian, legendary world.”

6,2020-11-09 00:00:00,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201109-why-the-funniest-books-are-also-the-most-serious,Why the funniest books are also the most serious,"Novelist Sophie Hannah, who does recognise Murdoch’s comic brilliance and wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of The Black Prince, says the comic and the serious are inextricably linked in her novels: “She understands that the often-comic absurdity of life is absolutely inextricable from its utmost seriousness. The humour enhances rather than detracts from the seriousness, and vice versa.”

If that sounds familiar, then it should: literature is awash with books that are both very serious and very funny. “Writers are funny because life is funny,” as Amis puts it. That’s true not just of satirists like Charles Dickens, but even those traditionally seen as merchants of gloom like Samuel Beckett and Franz Kafka, whose absurdist vision of the world – broadly put – is that if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry. Take Waiting for Godot: what could be funnier, more ridiculous, than waiting around endlessly for someone you know will never turn up – twice?

Mixed emotions

The best comedy needs tragedy, as essential ballast to stop it from floating away: the Booker Prize does from time to time recognise comic fiction, and Howard Jacobson’s Booker 2010 novel The Finkler Question, about ageing and death, is not just connected to tragedy but steeped in it. When a Jewish woman is faced with a feeble attempt at antisemitic intimidation, she “wasn’t going from fear to amusement and back again, she was experiencing both emotions simultaneously. It wasn’t even a matter of recording opposites because they were not opposites for her. Each partook of the other.”

What could be more complete – what could be better value? – than tragedy and comedy entwined? Kurt Vonnegut’s best work exemplified this hybrid approach, in books such as his Holocaust novel Slaughterhouse-Five, his tragicomedy Slapstick – about the modern epidemic of loneliness – and his manic end-of-the-world fable. Marie Phillips, author of several comic novels including Gods Behaving Badly, agrees in a Beckettian way: “The world is absurd even – or especially – at its worst.”

Phillips says that “people make the mistake of thinking that the opposite of funny is serious and thus if you’re funny you can’t be serious and vice versa.” The opposite of funny, of course, isn’t serious; the opposite of funny is unfunny. Funny and serious are symbiotic because humour is not just an example of intelligence but a form of intelligence. It requires lateral thinking; making unexpected connections; being one step ahead of the reader. To another Booker winner, George Saunders, “Comic, for me, means there’s always a shortfall between what we think of ourselves and what we are.” It goes, that is to say, to the heart of character in fiction."

It can prevent cognitive decline in later life, help you live longer, earn more money and be happier. While it is no substitute for a healthy diet and regular exercise, it costs nothing and can be done in seconds. All of this can be yours in exchange for three little words: “I forgive you.”

It is remarkable to think that this simple phrase can be so impactful. And these are just the benefits to the forgiver – so consider the unburdening of guilt on the part of the transgressor too. But an act of forgiveness doesn’t have to follow an apology. Even if the person who offended you shows no remorse, you can forgive them and reap the benefits.

“I don’t know if there is a sphere of your life that will not be positively impacted by being more forgiving,” says Loren Toussaint, a psychologist who studies forgiveness at Luther College, Iowa, US. For Toussaint, there’s no argument for holding back an olive branch.

If you think of our cultural influences, too, forgiveness is everywhere. Is there a culture or religion on this planet that does not encourage reconciliation whether with your God or fellow human?

However, despite how seemingly near-universal forgiveness is, not all acts are created equal. Our cultures and our personal psychologies affect how we choose to offer forgiveness, and the benefits that come with it."

From her first appearance dressed as ‘a mad tree’ at the family home, Corrin commands the screen, capturing both the young Diana’s gawky awkwardness and her desperate desire to be loved.

This is particularly true of what is probably the outstanding episode of the series, episode three’s Fairytale, which begins with Diana’s engagement to Charles and then follows the soon-to-be Princess of Wales through the six increasingly lonely weeks leading up to her wedding. It’s a beautifully paced hour of television, anchored by Corrin’s charisma ­– the scenes of Diana roller-skating around Buckingham Palace, Duran Duran playing on her Walkman, are both charming and very funny – and tempered by dark hints of difficulties to come.

Like Anderson’s, Corrin’s is a performance that only deepens as the series continues and we see Diana not only evolve as a style icon but, more importantly, begin to grasp the unique power that she possesses within the royal family, a power that can be wielded against them as much as for them.

None of this would work, however, if Morgan came down too firmly on one side of the Great Wales Marriage Debate. Instead he paints a sympathetic portrait of all three individuals involved, with the pragmatic Camilla Parker-Bowles (a smart and sexy Emerald Fennell) repeatedly shown to be far more suited to the set-in-his-ways Charles, while Charles himself, genuinely in love with Camilla, is clearly railroaded into a marriage he knows is all wrong even as he desperately tries to believe it could possibly work."

Will only the wealthy be able to travel?

When it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, I keep repeating baseball player and philosopher Yogi Berra’s wise advice that “It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”

In the travel game, it’s tough even to understand what’s going on in the present. Some countries (Australia) won’t let people out, other countries (America) won’t let people in, even when they’re coming from a place with a better virus story. Or you can leave (the UK) and go somewhere else (the list changes daily) only to find (typically at 4 a.m.) all sorts of restrictions on your return.

None of this encourages travel, and it’s probably a safe bet that merely making the decision to head for the departure gate is going to be a fraught choice for some time to come. Quite apart from dealing with the bureaucracy and rules, I’m afraid that post-pandemic travel will be to a very different new world. Will we be welcomed? Will we be safe? And can we afford it? It will be a sad new world if travel becomes something only for the rich and gap-year travel becomes a rite of passage that ceases to exist.

Of course, a travel reassessment will give us the opportunity to tackle some of the industry’s inevitable drawbacks from a fresh perspective, but will we tackle overtourism and climate change, or just turn the power back on and hit restart?

How will AI shape our lives post-Covid?

Covid-19 is a test like no other. Never before have the lives of so many people around the world been affected at this scale or speed.

Over the past six months, thousands of AI innovations have sprung up in response to the challenges of life under lockdown. Governments are mobilising machine-learning in many ways, from contact-tracing apps to telemedicine and remote learning.

However, as the digital transformation accelerates exponentially, it is highlighting the challenges of AI. Ethical dilemmas are already a reality – including privacy risks and discriminatory bias.

It is up to us to decide what we want AI to look like: there is a legislative vacuum that needs to be filled now. Principles such as proportionality, inclusivity, human oversight and transparency can create a framework allowing us to anticipate these issues.

This is why Unesco is working to build consensus among 193 countries to lay the ethical foundations of AI. Building on these principles, countries will be able to develop national policies that ensure AI is designed, developed and deployed in compliance with fundamental human values.

As we face new, previously unimaginable challenges – like the pandemic – we must ensure that the tools we are developing work for us, and not against us.

What will we be craving in a post-pandemic world?

There are three clear legacies from the Covid-19 pandemic. They all derive from the unnatural and unpleasant circumstances imposed by the pandemic and the necessary public health responses.

First, we all want security. The pandemic has filled us with uncertainty and insecurity. The natural response is to want security. This means security in having an income, child care, family leave and other things necessary to care for your family during a pandemic. Every country will have to critically evaluate its social safety net and shore it up.

Second, we all want sociabilities. Human are social animals. The isolation imposed by Covid-19 is debilitating. We want to have opportunities to be with other people, share meals, share a drink in the pub, and share activities. We see this when restrictions are eased how people run for parties and group settings. Opportunities and venues for sociabilities will become huge post-Covid.

Third, travel will explode after the pandemic. People like (safe) novelty and changes of scenery. We have all been locked down with the monotony of the same rooms, same walking routine, inability to see new things. When it is safe to travel, people will go, go, go.

Giuseppe Sala: Mayor of Milan and Chair of the C40 Mayors Covid-19 Recovery Task Force

How can we protect city dwellers?

Cities have already fundamentally changed as a result of the Covid crisis. By delivering a green and just recovery from the pandemic, we can create the cities and the future we want. Working closely with local communities and businesses, mayors around the world have taken urgent action to protect the health and wellbeing of our citizens.

We’re helping create good green jobs, supporting key workers, investing in safe, resilient mass transit, rapidly expanding bike lanes and increasing the amount of green space in our cities. The experience of lockdown has made clear the need for well resourced, local amenities, which is why many people are looking at 15-minute cities, where all city residents are able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes.

Many of these innovations have been introduced incredibly quickly, demonstrating just how fast things can change. And they are here to stay. A return to ‘business as usual’ would not just be a monumental failure of imagination, but lock in the inequities laid bare by the pandemic and the inevitability of more devastating crises due to climate breakdown. That could be the most hopeful legacy of this most challenging year.

Covid-19 at the very beginning is a public health issue, and then was further developed as a political concern. It challenged the nature of urban design, and pushed us to reconsider the use architecture and city space.

“Sharing” used to be one of the most important agenda in urban design and planning. In our past architectural practices, we used to make a lot of efforts on providing more open space to stimulate social interactions, which was considered as a positive and revolutionary action. However, the pandemic led to more discussions on isolation and social distancing, rather than sharing and co-living. Our efforts on providing better public space is questioned, and they might be considered not that important anymore.

However, in the long run, public space will still be the foundation for sharing our cities. We can’t imagine the city as a perfectly functioning hospital, because the city should surpass functionality and reflect our ideal for living. Interpersonal communication is still essential, but in the post-pandemic era might be greatly challenged.

How could cities help solve pandemic inequalities?

With an estimated 90% of all reported Covid-19 cases recorded in urban areas, cities have become the epicentre of the pandemic. At the same time, I believe that the solutions to the socio-economic and health challenges will be found in cities.

Cities are already changing because residents have transformed the way they live and work. Governments have woken up to the urgent need to address issues around inequalities.

It is not the density of cities that leads to people being infected, it is unequal access to adequate housing, energy, water, sanitation, transport, green public spaces, healthcare and education. Cities will see dramatic changes because citizens will not put up with these inequalities. What we will look for in a home and in our living environment will be determined by where we find ourselves. My hope is that people will use their new-found political muscle to ensure that there is an equitable spread of resources in cities. As we build back better, we will need an empathy revolution to ensure we do not leave behind the most vulnerable groups.

Another major change for many is the discovery that we can work from home. We will seek to retrofit our homes to be able to maximise the opportunities and tackle the challenges this transformation presents to us all.

Ultimately, cities are made up of people and the pandemic has shown that infinite growth has its limits. We either need to adapt, or go the way of the dinosaurs. I believe we can and will change. This is our opportunity to plan and regenerate environmentally sustainable cities which power the Secretary-General’s vision of building back better and greener.

What will transport look like?

Just a few months ago, the future of transportation was app-enabled mobility and visions of driverless cars. That version of the future crashed as the coronavirus advanced, and as car traffic vanished from city streets.

The transportation rescue hasn’t come in Ubers or robot cars. Cities on every continent responded by returning to old mobility and reclaiming roads for new uses. Milan, Paris and London are just some of the cities that have converted hundreds of miles of former driving and parking lanes into bus and bike lanes, and outdoor restaurant and café seating, allowing millions of residents to come outside safely simply by providing six feet of safe distance.

These steps, which would have been controversial before the pandemic, are today a first draft of what a new future of transportation could look like in post-Covid cities. Six feet of safe space on roads and sidewalks is all that cities need to transition from life shut indoors to a reopened, outside economy. There is six feet of space concealed within individual lanes on almost every street that can be readapted for safe, socially distant mobility, to create open-air commercial districts, and to make space for outdoor classrooms and civic activities like voting. The six-foot streets that the global economic recovery will be built upon are already within reach, and the outdoor, place-making activities that they make possible can make cities, safer, more resilient and more sustainable long after the pandemic. The six-foot city is already within reach on thousands of roads around the world, and wherever there are six feet, there is just enough space to hold us all together."
27,2020-11-08 00:00:00,https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20201108-why-germans-love-getting-naked-in-public,Why Germans love getting naked in public,"After four years of living in Berlin, I’ve learned to embrace Germany’s anything-goes sprit and more casual approach to nudity than where I grew up in the Midwestern US.

You never forget your first time confronted by public nudity

While nudity in mainstream American culture is generally considered to be sexual, here in Germany, stripping down isn’t uncommon in certain everyday situations. I’ve grown used to nude-by-default saunas; taken dips in pools where swimming suits were birthday suits; and surprised a massage therapist when I disrobed unprompted before a treatment, leading him to remark that Americans usually need to be asked to take off their clothes.

But, as the saying kind of goes, you never forget your first time confronted by public nudity. My introduction came during a jog through Hasenheide, a park in Berlin’s southern Neukölln district, when I came across a cluster of nude bodies taking in the bright afternoon sun. Later, after speaking with friends and acquiring a fairly questionable Google search history, I found out that stumbling across an au naturel enclave in a city park or beach is practically a rite of passage in Berlin.

Stripping down to your essence in the natural world has historically been an act of both resistance and relief

What I’d seen wasn’t part of Berlin’s hedonistic side, however, but an example of Freikörperkultur, or “free-body culture”. FKK, as it’s usually shortened to, is associated closely with life in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany or “GDR”), but nudism in Germany as a public practice stretches back to the late 19th Century. And unlike, say, taking off your top at a beach in Spain, FKK encompasses a broader German movement with a distinct spirit, where stripping down to your essence in the natural world has historically been an act of both resistance and relief.

“Nudism has had a long tradition in Germany,” said Arnd Bauerkämper, associate professor of modern history at Freie University in Berlin. At the turn of the 20th Century, Lebensreform (“life reform”) was in the air, a philosophy that advocated for organic food, sexual liberation, alternative medicine and simpler living closer to nature. “Nudism is part of this broader movement, which was directed against industrial modernity, against the new society that emerged in the late 19th Century,” Bauerkämper said.

According to Hanno Hochmuth, a historian at the Leibniz Centre for Contemporary History Potsdam, this reform movement took particular hold in larger cities, including Berlin, despite its romanticising of country living. During the Weimar Era (1918-1933), FKK beaches populated by “a very, very small minority” of sunbathing members of the bourgeois sprang up. According to Bauerkämper, there was a “sense of new freedom after the authoritarian society and suffocating conservative values of Imperial Germany (1871 to 1918).”

In 1926, Alfred Koch founded the Berlin School of Nudism to encourage mixed-gender nudist exercise, continuing the belief that outdoor nudity promoted harmony with nature and wellness benefits. And while Nazi ideology initially prohibited FKK, viewing it as a spring of immorality, by 1942 the Third Reich had softened its public nudity restrictions – though, of course, that tolerance wasn’t extended to groups the Nazis persecuted, like Jews and communists.

But it wasn’t until the decades after Germany’s post-war division into East and West that FKK really blossomed, particularly in the East – though embracing getting naked was no longer restricted to the bourgeois class. For Germans living in the communist GDR, where travel, personal liberties and sales of consumer goods were curtailed, FKK functioned in part as a “safety valve,” according to Bauerkämper; a way to let off tension in a deeply restrictive state by providing a bit of “free movement”.

Hochmuth, who visited nude beaches with his parents as a child growing up in East Berlin agrees. “There was some sense of escapism,” he said. “[East Germans] were always exposed to all these demands of the Communist Party and what they had to do, like going to party rallies or being asked to perform communal tasks on weekends without pay.”

There was some sense of escapism

While rogue East Germans continued bathing in the buff in the GDR’s early years – while keeping an eye out for patrolling policemen – it wasn’t until after Erich Honecker took power in 1971 that FKK would officially be allowed again. According to Bauerkämper, under Honecker the GDR began a process of opening up foreign and domestic policies, a tactic meant to make itself look more favourable to the outside world.

“For the GDR it was quite useful to argue that, ‘OK, we are allowing and even encouraging nudism, we are kind of a free society’,” said Bauerkämper.

Since East Germany merged with the larger West in 1990 and restrictions lifted in the former communist state, FKK culture has declined. In the 1970s and ‘80s, hundreds of thousands of nudists packed campgrounds, beaches and parks. In 2019, the German Association for Free Body Culture counted only 30,000-plus registered members – many of whom were in their 50s and 60s.

Yet today, FKK continues to leave an impression on German culture, particularly in the former East. It even manages to make the occasional viral headline, such as when a naked man in an FKK-designated area at a Berlin lake this summer was forced to give chase to a wild boar that had run off with a bag containing his laptop.

This media cannot be played on your device.

In fact, FKK and Germany’s longer tradition of nudism has left a widespread tolerance across the country for clothing-free spaces and public nudity as a form of wellness. As I discovered, FKK spaces can still be found without looking too hard, and they’re often tied to health pursuits.

If you are used to seeing people naked, you don’t give much thought about appearances

The listings site Nacktbaden.de offers a well-organised list of beaches and parks throughout Germany where you can sunbathe nude; strip down at saunas and spas; or go for hikes in the buff in places like the Harz Mountains, Bavarian Alps or the forests of Saxony-Anhalt. Or, if you want to be a bit more formal about it, the sporting club FSV Adolf Koch offers nude yoga, volleyball, badminton and table tennis in Berlin.

In many ways, the FKK legacy gives travellers an insight into values that still unite many East Germans. For Sylva Sternkopf, who grew up going to FKK beaches in East Germany, the country’s free-body culture has both reflected and imparted certain values that she’s passing down to her children, particularly the country’s open-mindedness towards their own bodies.

“I think this is still very deeply rooted in my generation in East Germany,” she said. “I also try to give this on to my children, to raise them in this way of being open towards your own body and not being ashamed of being yourself and being naked, of showing yourself naked.”

For Sternkopf, seeing nude bodies in a non-sexualised way also helps people learn to see others beyond their outer appearances. By baring it all, it makes it easier to see not just a body, but the individual.

“If you are used to seeing people naked, you don’t give much thought about appearances,” she said. “I think this is something that is more widespread in East Germany in general: we try to judge people not for their outer appearance, but we always try to look underneath.

It was a blow for the ecocide movement – she had been its leading legal light and fiercest advocate, selling her house and giving up her high-paying job in order to dedicate her life to the campaign. Despite her passing, that the movement now appears to be gaining momentum. After decades of existing at the radical fringes of the environmental movement, ecocide is now being discussed by parliamentarians and leaders across the world.

Among them is Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, who has become one of ecocide’s highest profile supporters. Earlier this year, more than 99% of the French citizens’ assembly, a group of 150 people selected by lot to guide the country’s climate policy, voted to make ecocide a crime. That prompted Macron to announce that the government would consult with legal experts on how to incorporate it into French law. But he went further. “The mother of all battles is international: to ensure that this term is enshrined in international law so that leaders… are accountable before the International Criminal Court,” he responded to the assembly.

Elsewhere in Europe, Belgium’s two Green parties have introduced an ecocide bill that proposes addressing the issue at both a national and international level – an idea that also has support among Swedish parliamentarians. “We have all the conventions, we have all the goals. But the beautiful visions must go from paper into action,” said Rebecka Le Moine, the Swedish MP who submitted a motion to her national parliament. “If these actions should be anything more than goodwill or activism, it must become law.”

Pope Francis has also called for ecocide to be recognised as a crime by the international community, and Greta Thunberg has backed the cause too, donating €100,000 (£90,000) in personal prize winnings to the Stop Ecocide Foundation."

What used to be a collection of vibrant timber and tin-roofed shops is now a heap of charred remains, with many people crowded nearby.

The Ogiek are a hunter-gatherer community that inhabit the Mau and Mount Elgon forests in Kenya and some parts of northern Tanzania. It is those living in the Mau Forest who have suffered the most from evictions from their ancestral land. Traditionally, the community allocated sections of forest to each of its 12 clans. The Ogiek People’s Development Program, a non-governmental organisation, explains that this allocation was to ensure that they “protect, conserve, preserve and utilise the forest in a suitable and sustainable manner”, detailed a document that marries the community’s customary laws to national and international laws. Like the Ogiek, the Sengwer – a larger community of about 33,000 people, within 21 clans – have documented their customary laws, which they vow to abide by if allowed to live in and conserve the forest.

“It is our way of life that preserves the forest and our way of life is guided by taboos that regulated how we interact with each other, the forest and its resources,” says Milka Chepkorir, a member of the Sengwer of Embobut. Elias Kimaiyo, who is also Sengwer, was part of a team that documented these customary laws. “We have put the by-laws in writing so that they can see the difference and appreciate the fact that they are inexpensive and easy to use,” Kimaiyo tells me.

Lina Taploson, an elder and a leader of the Ogiek residing in the forest-edge hamlet of Ndoswa in the Mau, describes a similar relationship between her community and the forest. “We lived in the forest, had our traditions and got everything including food and medicine from the forest,” she says.

Both communities’ lifestyles historically did not depend on cultivation, ensuring that no forest was cleared. “Women and children only picked dry sticks from the ground as it was taboo to cut a tree for the purpose of firewood,” says Chepkorir, of the Sengwer traditions. For medicine, they picked herbs from roots, barks or leaves. “One was required to only pick what was adequate for use only and not to stock the medicine,” says Chepkorir. “[We] were also required to cover the injured part of the root, back or branch where the medicine was harvested from to prevent the tree from drying up.”"
37,2020-10-27 00:00:00,http://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201027-the-fight-to-save-cape-cods-dolphins,The fight to save Cape Cod’s dolphins,"It’s the heavy breath that’s so striking. A gulp of air, drawn by the dolphin calf’s collapsing lungs as it lies stranded on the sands of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. There’s something almost human about the desperate gasp from its blowhole, which makes the sound all the more harrowing.

“When these dolphins strand it’s equivalent to a human being in a car accident,” explains Brian Sharp, the director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (Ifaw) sea mammal rescue team. “They’re feeling the full effects of gravity for the first time, plus the stress and shock.”

The calf has not only been separated from its mother, who has beached 20m further along the shore, it’s also entered an alien world hostile to survival. (Watch the efforts to save the dolphins here.)

The seawater around the calf is rapidly draining with the tide. Stuck in shallow, seaweed-tangled water, the sensitive skin of a dolphin can develop third-degree burns in minutes if left unprotected in the summer sun. The stress of the stranding can also lead to capture myopathy syndrome, where dehydration and exhaustion combine to create rapid, stress-induced muscle degeneration. Heart muscles can often be the first to go.

More dolphins run aground on this stretch of Cape Cod shoreline than almost anywhere in the world. More than 400 strandings happened in 2019, and in August 2020, 45 dolphins beached in one day alone.

The good news is that the Ifaw team has shown it is possible to increase survival rates from such strandings significantly. “When we started doing this back in 1998, the release rate was barely 14%,” says Sharp. “Over the years, as we’ve introduced new technology, new protocols, new techniques; that percentage has increased to over 78%.”

And they are not the only groups using new approaches to save beached ocean mammals. So, what’s changed, and what might the future hold for rescuing greater numbers of these charismatic sea creatures?

The tidal range of Cape Cod Bay is so large that over 50 sq km (19 sq miles) of sand flats are revealed by the retreating water every day. For the pods of dolphins who chase their food here, the shallows can all too quickly turn into a maze of draining water. In the past, the chances of survival were poor.

“Prior to 2010, the leading thinking was that anytime a single dolphin stranded the animal must be sick, diseased, separated from its group and the only responsible thing to do was euthanise it. [But] we can give the animal a second chance,” Sharp adds."

This may not be unusual – but the speed with which she was able to make the transition was. Within a week, she was shadowing a carer in Workington, England. Within a month, she was working as a carer herself.

Not only was her training rapid – it also took place completely in her own home. “I began the recruitment process by e-mail and completed my assessment online, which was followed by an interview and training process that was entirely digital,” she says.

She did this through a UK-based company called Cera Care, a “tech-enabled care provider” that doesn’t own or operate any care homes. It allows families to arrange and manage home care for their relatives using a digital platform that finds a match for customers from a pool of available caregivers. It also uses Uber to ferry patients back and forth to hospitals for appointments and an on-demand delivery service to fetch customers’ prescriptions from pharmacies.

The firm has raised over £20m ($26m) in investment since its inception in 2016 and delivers around half a million home visits every month, Tinkler’s included.

Since Covid-19 struck, hiring managers have had to think creatively about how to streamline their interview processes. With traditional face-to-face meetings on hold, the solution for some has come in the form of asynchronous video interviews, or AVIs, in which applicants film themselves answering a predetermined set of questions, with no human interviewer present.

In some cases, these recordings are then evaluated by a hiring manager, in others artificial intelligence and facial analysis software are used to assess candidates. Companies report that this type of interviewing can make the hiring process more efficient, but for applicants this job screening method − which may feel like a one-way Zoom conversation – can be uncomfortable.

As the pandemic continues to prevent in-person meetings, job seekers in manufacturing, retail and other industries are more likely to find themselves chatting with a bot at their next interview. Adapting to this format and understanding how to maximise the chance of a positive interview could be key to a successful job hunt.

Saving time

Even before the pandemic, AVIs were being used as the first stage of recruitment in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, tech, business and finance sectors, according to Carlos Flores, a career management specialist at Rutgers University in the US state of New Jersey. While exact statistics are hard to come by (AVIs have been adopted relatively recently by major companies and market reports don’t distinguish between them and face-to-face video interviews), experts say that for larger organisations with a national workforce of lower-skilled positions, AVIs have become a convenient way to skim through hundreds or thousands of applicants at a faster rate.

HireVue, one of the leading interview technology companies, says it is used today by more than 700 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, who collectively have conducted over 10 million interviews through its platform. Modern Hire, another interview technology platform, supported over 20 million assessments and interviews, and saw a 40% increase in users in 2019."

The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows.

The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"".

Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised.

The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month.

No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time.

There are still huge challenges ahead, but the announcement has been warmly welcomed with scientists describing themselves smiling ""ear to ear"" and some suggesting life could be back to normal by spring.

""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" said Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University.

How effective could it be?

A vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives.

The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose.

However, the data presented is not the final analysis as it is based on only the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid so the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed.

Dr Albert Bourla, the chairman of Pfizer, said: ""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis.""

Prof Ugur Sahin, one of the founders of BioNTech, described the results as a ""milestone"".

media caption Sarah Montague reacted with excitement upon hearing Professor Bell's views on the significance of today's vaccine news

When will the vaccine be available?

A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year.

Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators.

Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns.

The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses.

The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered.

Who would get it?

Not everyone will get the vaccine straight away and countries are each deciding who should be prioritised.

Hospital staff and care home workers will be near the top of every list because of the vulnerable people they work with, as will the elderly who are most at risk of severe disease.

The UK is likely to prioritise older resident in care homes and the people that work there.

But it says a final decision has not been made, saying it will depend on how well the vaccine works in different age-groups and how the virus is spreading.

People under 50 and with no medical problems are likely to be last in the queue.

Are there any potential problems?

There are still many unanswered questions as this is only interim data.

We do not know if the vaccine stops you spreading the virus or just from developing symptoms. Or if it works equally well in high-risk elderly people.

The biggest question - how long does immunity last - will take months or potentially years to answer.

There are also massive manufacturing and logistical challenges in immunising huge numbers of people, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C.

The vaccine appears safe from the large trials so far but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe.

How does it work?

There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results.

It uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system.

Previous trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus.

What has the reaction been?

The UK's chief medical advisor Prof Chris Whitty said the results showed the ""power of science"" and was a ""reason for optimism"" for 2021.

Preliminary news that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is effective demonstrates the power of science against COVID. We must see the final safety and efficacy data, but it is very encouraging.



It is essential we continue to suppress COVID, but it is a reason for optimism for 2021. — Professor Chris Whitty (@CMO_England) November 9, 2020

The US president-elect Joe Biden said it was ""excellent news"".

""It is also important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away,"" he added.

The UK Prime Minister's official spokesman said the results were ""promising"" and that ""the NHS stands ready to begin a vaccination programme for those most at risk once a Covid-19 vaccine is available"".

Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, said: ""This news made me smile from ear to ear.

Lockdown 2.0 is on its way, with ministers saying they have been left with no choice if lives are to be saved and the NHS is not to be overwhelmed.

It seems to be an open-and-shut case. But as MPs prepare to vote on the lockdown a number of questions remain to be answered.

How will it be used to fix Test and Trace?

One of the benefits of lockdown, it has been suggested, is that it will provide time to fix England's NHS Test and Trace system.

It is routinely failing to meet its targets to reach people who test positive, and then obtain and contact their close contacts to ask them to isolate.

But solving that is easier said than done.

image copyright Reuters

Councils are now being encouraged to set up their own local contact-tracing teams to try to improve the reach of the service.

About one-third have something up and running, but most are just at the start with skeleton teams and IT struggles.

Directors of public health are frustrated they were only given money to do this as the second wave got under way, rather than earlier in the year when infection rates were lower and it would have been easier to build up.

What is more, very few people appear to be isolating. Research suggests fewer than one in five are doing so fully.

The government is now providing help - those on low incomes are getting £500 support payments. But that, some say, is not enough.

""The government simply doesn't understand the difficulties people face in terms of lost income and job insecurity,"" says one chief executive who has had in-depth negotiations with the government on the issue.

""We're doing all this work to try to reach them, but then don't help them isolate. What's the point?""

Exactly how close is the NHS to being overwhelmed?

The government presents detailed statistics on Covid. They show more than 9,000 patients are currently in hospitals in England.

But what we are not being told is exactly just how full hospitals are.

The Covid patients take up fewer than one in 10 beds.

So far, both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have refused to reveal the number of available beds once you take into account patients being treated in hospital for other conditions.

Figures obtained by the Health Service Journal, which the BBC understands are correct, suggest just over 80% of beds are occupied.

That's actually a little bit lower than it was last winter, reflecting the fact that despite efforts to do more non-Covid work, such as cancer care and routine surgery, the numbers remain well below pre-pandemic levels.

It provides a bit of wriggle room, but not much. In fact, those areas like Manchester and Liverpool that have seen a significant proportion of the admissions are close to being full.

But there are a number of options the NHS has to increase capacity. One is to start cancelling non-urgent treatments - and some hospitals have already started to do this.

The other is to use the Nightingale field hospitals. The one in the North West has started taking non-Covid patients to ease the pressure on hospitals in that region.

Could the others be deployed? Possibly, although unions have questioned where the staff are going to come from to care for patients.

But regardless of that it is virtually impossible to assess just how acute the pressures are.

NHS leaders are due to hold a press briefing on Wednesday, which may shed some light on the issue.

Why has more not been done to protect the vulnerable?

We know the virus has killed a disproportionate number of people who are either elderly or have an underlying health condition.

Yet as the second wave has taken off, the number of outbreaks linked to care homes has started increasing, while one in five of the ""new hospital cases"" are actually people thought to have caught the virus in hospital.

This is a source of frustration for many experts.

Research shows that three-quarters of deaths in the first wave came from just 5% of the population judged to be at highest risk, according to modelling by Oxford University.

This 5% will include people in care homes and those sick enough to be in hospital for other conditions.

Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases expert at Edinburgh University, says he cannot understand why more is not being done alongside the social distancing rules already in place to protect such groups.

It could, he believes, ""make a significant difference"" to the number of deaths. ""It's unconscionable we are not doing more.""

What could be done? A range of different suggestions have been put forward to government.

These include supporting multi-generational households by offering free hotel accommodation, boosting the care home workforce so staff do not need to work across multiple homes making it easier for infections to spread, and providing more testing to hospital staff and also those who having caring responsibilities.

How many people could actually die?

One of the most alarming charts presented by the government when it announced the latest lockdown on Saturday looked at a range of scenarios for the number of predicted deaths in England.

The worst projection suggested deaths could reach 4,000 a day - as the graph below shows.

But it now turns out that projection was out-of-date.

It was based on figures from the start of October, which show by now there should be 1,000 deaths a day. The current average is a quarter of that number.

What is more, the Public Health England and the Cambridge University team that produced it have since published reports based on the more recently available data.

Grilled by MPs on this on Tuesday, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he apologised if it caused confusion.

Could the second wave have peaked?

What is also interesting is that none of the scenarios for deaths factored in the regional restrictions that the government has imposed since mid-October.

The UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was pressed on this by MPs on Tuesday. He argued while there were some signs the restrictions were starting to have an impact, it would not be enough to get infections down sufficiently.

But others question this. Prof Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University, says he is concerned by the use of clearly out-of-date modelling.

He says making such predictions is notoriously difficult and any forecasts ""beyond two weeks"" come with a huge margin of error.

There is, he believes, some signs the rise in infections and in hospital cases is beginning to slow and would like to see that given time to play out.

Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Study, has gone even further, tweeting the peak of the second wave may have passed.

But he said this would take one to two weeks to translate to hospital infections and four weeks to change the trend on deaths.

What is the impact of lockdown?

image copyright Reuters

The development of government policy is normally accompanied by a full assessment, comparing the benefit of doing something and balancing that against the cost.

When the UK first entered lockdown, this was not done.

And that seems to have been repeated again despite warnings about the indirect toll of lockdown - from mental health problems and people delaying seeking help for other health conditions, to the economic consequences.

Although Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, has challenged the prime minister to publish the assessment if one is available before MPs vote later.

The government though says it is making attempts to minimise the consequences, pointing to the extension of furlough payments so employers can claim up to 80% of staff wages.

And it has been at pains to stress the NHS is still there for non-Covid health issues. In fact, it says without lockdown other services would have to be cut back because of the rise in Covid cases.

But the fear is lockdown will act as a deterrent to those seeking care, while isolation and job worries will increase mental health problems.

University College London psychiatrist Prof Sonia Johnson is worried that there has been ""little specific focus on the costs of lockdown on the most marginalised and excluded"" in society.

The risk is that the cure is worse than the disease - and some believe we are not properly modelling this to help work out ahead of time if it is."

A vaccine which can prevent nine out of 10 people getting Covid-19 is set to be put forward for emergency approval.

Its developers, Pfizer and BioNTech, said it had been tested on 43,500 people, with no safety concerns raised.

What is the new vaccine and how effective is it?

The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus.

It is a new type of vaccine called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus' genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.

It is given in two doses - three weeks apart - and early data suggests it protects more than 90% of people from developing Covid symptoms.

Has this type of vaccine ever been used before?

There are no RNA vaccines that have been approved for use in people.

The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases.

The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, which will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.

Who will get it first and how soon can I have it?

It depends how old you are, as age is the biggest risk factor for severe Covid-19.

In the UK, older care home residents and care home staff are top of the preliminary priority list. They are followed by health workers such as hospital staff.

People are then ranked by age, with people under 50 at the bottom of the list.

The first jabs may take place before Christmas if everything goes smoothly.

The vaccine will be delivered through care homes, GPs and pharmacists as well as ""go-to"" vaccination centres set up in venues such as sports halls.

However, there are huge logistical challenges to overcome - not least the need to store the vaccine at minus 80C, something beyond your local GP surgery.

Will it offer lasting protection?

It is impossible to know and we will find the answer only by waiting.

If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have a vaccine every year, in the same way as for flu.

The data did not show whether protection from Covid-19 was the same in all age groups. However, earlier studies did suggest young and old people could produce an immune response.

There will also be some people - such as those with a weak immune system - who will not be able to have the vaccine.

image copyright Getty Images

Could the vaccine have long-term health effects?

Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks.

The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects have been reported.

If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent.

However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised.

Will it mean we don't need lockdown?

Hopefully yes, but not for some time.

If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures for controlling the virus.

The challenge, however, is getting from now to that point.

There is still the monumental challenge of manufacturing enough vaccine and actually getting it into people. It is all going to take time and we need something to control the virus until then.

So, testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet.

What if the virus mutates?

Viruses mutate all the time, it's what they do. The question is, will they mutate in a way that changes their behaviour?

So far there is no sign of that happening, but it is possible that in the future the virus may change so the vaccine becomes less effective.

If that happens, then a new coronavirus vaccine may need to be designed.

This is not unusual. A new flu vaccine is developed each year to try to match the strains of flu that are doing the rounds.

And the RNA vaccine technology is very easy to tweak so this should not be a major problem.

image copyright Getty Images

Why can it only be made by Pfizer?

The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property.

They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further.

What do we still need to know about the vaccine?

The announcement gave us the headline, but there is a still lack of fine detail.

We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups.

These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used.

What does this mean for other vaccines?

It is good news. It shows that a coronavirus vaccine is possible, which we didn't know a couple of days ago.

As many of the vaccines are targeting the same part of the virus - what's known as the spike protein - it raises hopes they will work too.

There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of clinical development.

No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time."

Continuing his round of interviews, the health secretary speaks to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, where he's asked about criticism of the Vaccine Taskforce chairwoman Kate Bingham.

He's asked about reports it used a team of eight PR consultants at a cost of £670,000.

The government has also denied claims that she shared sensitive information about the UK vaccination plans with private investors , saying she only discussed publicly available information.

Matt Hancock said: ""Frankly, what matters is the substance of what the Vaccine Taskforce has achieved.""

He said the UK is ""one of the best-placed countries around the world"" after securing supplies of 340 million doses of six separate vaccines, including leading candidates from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.

Hancock said he was not aware of the PR contract, which was signed off by an official in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

""I’m comfortable with he fact that we have secured this unbelievable array of vaccines and we are delivering it as fast as we can,"" he said."

“There was no sense of outrage anywhere until we started really pushing it,” she says. “Disabled people were so clearly socially excluded.”

In the early 1970s, Barbara was living in north London with her mum and brothers. As a young child, she was “non-disabled”.

She couldn’t get on with the rules at her “posh and very strict school” and her sense of personal justice was already being tested.

“I got expelled. It was a convent run by nuns. I was rejecting the mindless discipline and religious zealotry.

“I built up so many detentions there wasn’t enough time in the year for me to do them all.”

Barbara Lisicki with her former partner and fellow campaigner Alan Holdsworth

Soon afterwards, Barbara developed a high temperature which wouldn’t go away - it was an early sign that her life was going to change.

Eventually, she ended up at a specialist juvenile rheumatology hospital in Taplow, Buckinghamshire. She remained there for over a year.

Barbara tells me she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis which causes pain, swelling and stiffness in her joints. It’s an autoimmune condition usually affecting the hands, feet and wrists. As Barbara puts it: “It’s basically where your body starts attacking itself.”

She made some friends at Taplow, but describes the overall experience as “horrible and oppressive”.

Once again, she found herself breaking the rules - regularly escaping the ward with an older girl.

In the hospital, they were made to use wheelchairs so as not to put too much weight on their hips.

“But we used to dump the wheelchairs in the bushes and hitchhike to the pub,” says Barbara. “They’d be sending out search parties and we’d be down there having a vodka and lime. I was 16.”

Barbara Lisicki

Barbara acknowledges she was smart, well-read and “a player”. She got a degree at university and a postgraduate teaching qualification.

“I thought: ‘I’m not going to be able to do a manual or factory job. Basically, I’m going to have to do something where I can sit down a lot!’”

But she struggled to get a teaching job.

That’s when her “get it” moment happened. She realised that employers were unwilling to offer a job to a disabled person. Many disabled people have “get it” moments, including me.

I'm blind, and when I was in my early 20s a security guard tried to stop me taking my guide dog into a cinema. Other staff helped me, but for the whole film I was worried I’d be made to leave, when I hadn’t done anything wrong.

Barbara says her opportunities were blocked by discrimination.

“I put down [on application forms] I had a long-term condition - I’m not even sure I used the term disabled person. I simply wasn’t getting jobs.”

“Everybody I qualified with on the teaching course got taken on except me. I’d done better than many of them - achieving credits and distinctions.

“It just struck me then, it was because I had an impairment. I was a disabled person.”"

His body was found in the early hours of 11 November 2019, on the cobblestones of Ali Pasha Street on the West side of Istanbul, Turkey. He had apparently fallen from the roof of his apartment.

Days before, the Russian foreign ministry had accused him of being a British spy, a claim vigorously denied by Britain’s then ambassador to the UN Dame Karen Pierce. Rumours swirled in the Russian, Syrian and Turkish media.

The Turkish police were on high alert. It had only been a year since the state sanctioned murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul. There were concerns that something similar might have happened to Le Mesurier. The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, made the bizarre claim that the whole thing was in some way connected to the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

Questions about who James Le Mesurier really was had dogged him for years. That’s because he was the co-founder of an organisation called the White Helmets, a civil defence force that works in rebel held areas of Syria. Dressed in hard hats and fleece jackets, they rescue people from under the rubble of buildings bombed by the Syrian and Russian militaries. James Le Mesurier’s charity, Mayday Rescue, was responsible for providing the White Helmets with training and equipment."

Poll watchers were allowed to observe the counting in most states although they generally needed to be registered in advance.

Hundreds of poll watchers were admitted to counts across the country.

Claim two: “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES”

He has won almost 71 million votes, but that has not been enough to win the election. Joe Biden received over 74 million and more importantly won enough states to take the presidency.

President Trump has offered no evidence for this.

Claim four: “MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WERE SENT TO PEOPLE WHO NEVER ASKED FOR THEM!”

BBC Visual Journalism team Published duration 8 hours ago Related Topics US election 2020

Much of the focus of the US election has been the battle for the presidency between two white men, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

But the nationwide ballot also saw Kamala Harris set to become the first woman vice-president and a record number of women voted into Congress - the part of the US government that writes and passes laws.

Here's how the numbers break down ahead of Congress's new term at the beginning of next year.

1. At least 135 women will have a say in Congress in 2021

Women, who make up just over half of the US population, currently make up just under a quarter of Congress's two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate.

However, when the 117th congressional term begins in January, an unprecedented 135 women, possibly more, will serve across both houses - with 103 Democrats and 32 Republicans voted in so far, according to Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP).

Women will take up just over a quarter of the 535 seats - 25.2% - up from the current 23.7%.

These totals could rise further, though, with the results of a number of contests still outstanding.

This year's figures are part of a long-running trend towards better representation for women, with most previous Congresses breaking the record that came before - some years more dramatically than others.

Now, for the 15th time in 16 Congresses, the proportion of women across the two chambers will rise.

Republican women have made particular progress this election after struggling to replicate the recent success of the Democrats.

In the mid-term elections in 2018, almost three-quarters of the women running for Congress were Democrats.

But from next year, while there are still more Democrat women than Republican women, the Republican Party will have its highest number of female Congressional representatives ever to serve.

So far 32 Republican women will sit across both houses, according to CAWP, surpassing the party's previous record of 30 in 2004.

They could up their numbers further in some of the outstanding contests. For example, Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler - appointed to the Senate last year to fill a vacant seat - will take on Democrat Raphael Warnock in the January run-off election in Georgia.

In the House of Representatives, the Republicans have almost doubled the number of women - from 13 to 24 - the result of concerted efforts by the party to recruit a more diverse range of candidates.

Among them are 13 ""non-incumbent"" Republican women - new candidates who do not already hold a seat.

However, the party still trails the Democrats, who are set to have 87 women or more serving from January.

CAWP director Debbie Walsh says the rising numbers are down to ""hard work"".

""Successes like these don't just happen,"" she says. ""They require the dedicated attention of parties, donors, activists, and voters, as is particularly evident from the expanded number of Republican women candidates this year.""

This year's election follows the 2018 mid-terms which saw a surge of women entering Congress for the Democrats, including ""The Squad"" - the informal name for a group of women elected to the House, made up of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

image caption Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was elected in 2018

But while significant progress has been made on the congressional gender balance in the last two years, men still take up almost three quarters of the seats in the House and the Senate.

While there will be 135 women in the two houses next year, there will be 400 men.

""The work continues,"" says CAWP's Ms Walsh.

2. Among the new representatives are 47 women of colour

As well as seeing increased numbers of women, the 2020 election has also seen women of colour solidify presence in the two chambers.

Overall, 47 lawmakers next year will be non-white women (from black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Island and Native American backgrounds) - down one from 48 across the House and the Senate.

All except one ran for the Democrats.

Among this record-breaking intake, will be an unprecedented number of Native American women.

Republican Yvette Herrell, who is Cherokee, beat the Democratic incumbent Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico, and will join Democrats Deb Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo member representing New Mexico, and Sharice Davids, a Ho-Chunk Nation member representing Kansas, who kept hold of their House of Representatives seats.

The wins for Ms Herrell and Ms Haaland also mean that New Mexico has become the first ever state to elect women of colour as all three of its delegates in the US House.

But diversity has not just increased inside Congress, it will be improved in the new administration's top team too.

Senator Kamala Harris is set to become the first woman elected to the vice presidency of the US. She is the third woman and the first woman of colour to be nominated by a major party for the position.

3. More women were elected because more stood as candidates

Two years ago, the 2018 mid-terms broke nearly all records in women's major-party nominations for Congress.

And this year women pushed things further still.

An unprecedented 318 women ran as Democratic or Republican candidates - official party nominees - for the 535 seats available across the House and the Senate.

That was up from the previous record of 257 set in 2018.

Of the 318 candidates, a record 117 were women of colour.

Marilyn Strickland, the first black woman to be sent to Congress by Washington state, says more women like her are now feeling comfortable standing as candidates.

""It is exciting to see so many women of colour step up,"" Ms Strickland told Good Morning America. ""I think the more that we see folks running for office, the more that we see people holding office, the more encouraged people are.""

In 2018, 234 women were nominees for the House, up more than 40% on the previous high of 167.

This year's election has seen 298 women stand as House candidates, a more modest 27% increase from the record set in 2018.

Of these, 204 women stood for the Democrats, according to CAWP, compared with 182 in 2018, and 94 stood for the Republicans, compared with 52 in 2018.

But while women House candidates increased this year, female Senate candidates fell.

There were just 20 women nominees for the Senate, compared with 23 last year.

Twelve of these stood for the Democrats - down from 15 in 2018 - while eight stood for the Republicans, the same number as in the mid-terms.

4. The newly-elected women are changing the way Congress looks and feels

Across the country there have been a number of historic wins, thrusting a diverse range of women into frontline US politics.

The state of Missouri will send its first woman of colour and first black woman to the US Congress following Cori Bush's victory last week.

The nurse and pastor, who played a high-profile role during anti-police brutality protests in Ferguson in 2014, was elected to the House for the state's first district.

Washington state will also send its first black woman to Congress.

Marilyn Strickland, the two-time former Democratic mayor of Tacoma, Washington, won her race in Washington's 10th Congressional District.

Thank you - to the voters of the 10th district for helping us make history last night, and to our supporters who have been with us on this journey. I am humbled by these results, and I look forward to working for our communities everyday in Congress. Let's get to work! pic.twitter.com/pyfNSGJc4L — Marilyn Strickland (@StricklandforWA) November 4, 2020

And at least two states will send their first Republican women to the House.

Ashley Hinson beat incumbent Democratic Abby Finkenauer in Iowa and Nancy Mace upset Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham in South Carolina.

Meanwhile, Wyoming will send its first ever woman to the Senate after Republican Cynthia Lummis beat Democratic opponent Merav Ben-David.

Yet, despite this year's firsts and record-breaking numbers, women will still make up just over a quarter of Congress in 2021.

Women's representation in American politics has been, through ""struggle and persistence"" on ""a long, if occasionally fitful, upward trajectory"", says CAWP 's Debbie Walsh.

And while 2018 was a story of Democratic success and this year has seen gains for the Republicans, she says, advances ""must come from both sides of the aisle"" if equal representation is to be achieved.

One thing's for sure, though, these newly-elected congresswomen representing both parties will be, from January, helping to shape legislation that will affect generations to come.

When Dr Ebun Ekunwe, 72, cast her ballot in 2016, she did so for Donald Trump. It was an act, she says, of “total rebellion” against the Democratic Party.

“I fervently supported Bernie Sanders,” she says. “I felt that the nomination was actually stolen from him. So we revolted against our own party.”

When Trump won, the retired doctor and pastor from Carrollton, Texas, hoped that he would rise to the occasion. Then, after white nationalists marched in Charlottesville in August 2017 and clashed violently with counter protesters, Trump made his now-infamous remark that “there were very fine people, on both sides”.

“For the purpose of healing the country, a leader does not go out and say that,” she says. “He has made the country about himself. He is reading the Constitution as ‘me, the president’ instead of ‘we, the people’.”

This year, even though she could vote by post, she wants to cast her ballot for Joe Biden in person.

“I want my voice to count,” she says. But doing so is not without risks for her in the pandemic - Ebun has sickle cell anaemia. She is managing her condition, but it will be on her mind as she casts her vote.

Ebun relies on Obamacare - another name for the 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. Without it, she says, she wouldn’t have been able to afford her cataract surgery

The pandemic has meant she has been unable to visit her doctor, and while her medical background enables her to take care of herself, she worries about others with pre-existing conditions. “I don’t know how they live from day-to-day,” she sighs. “They might be quietly, desperately saying, ‘Let nothing happen to my health’.”"

Jack Mount was born in 1919 and grew up around the family farm near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. Living in the countryside with four brothers and three sisters was exhilarating, with days spent building tree-houses and dens, or catching rabbits and moles. In a memoir he wrote about his early life, Mount described the joy of watching Barnsley home games at Oakwell football ground, the smell of hops wafting over from the nearby brewery.

Then as World War Two loomed, a 17-year-old Mount lied about his age to join the Royal Signals. He started as a despatch rider, then became a wireless operator in France and Northern Ireland, where he met his first wife, Beth, before being posted to Italy.

It was clear from his autobiography - self-published to mark his 90th birthday - he enjoyed numerous extra-marital romances while away from home and he censored little about the many women he wooed, even including details of sleeping with a woman in Bologna while his wife was pregnant.

Curiously, he gave a copy to every family member, including Beth whom he had divorced in the early 1960s, and his grandchildren. When they questioned the gall he had in revealing his affairs, he was perplexed.

“He just said, ‘it was a long time ago, what’s wrong with you?’” his daughter Tricia recalls. “He couldn’t understand why we were so upset.”

Mount, a slim man who was small in stature, left the Army determined to make something of himself and embarked upon a programme of reinvention. He moved Beth, their two sons and two daughters from Northern Ireland to Birmingham, completed a degree in child psychology, and, under the impression it was damaging his intellectual image, replaced his Yorkshire accent with the clipped sounds of an educated English gent.

After completing his teacher training, he worked in schools around Birmingham and became fixated with the idea of opening his own. When Hill House School in Shropshire came up for sale, he seized the opportunity. His new school, which he named Brookside, was opened up to almost every local authority in England and would cater for vulnerable children - or those deemed “maladjusted”. It was, at the time, a term used to describe highly dysfunctional behaviour - but some of the misdemeanors that landed youngsters in Mount’s care were, in fact, relatively minor.

Stephen Hesketh was considered one such child. His mother blamed his “unruly” behaviour on falling off a church roof and badly injuring his head, aged six. He says he doesn’t remember “being that bad as a kid”, but in 1968, he was taken from Liverpool to Brookside.

“My mum said to me, ‘if you don’t like it, just tell me and we’ll go’. I looked around and it seemed to me that the kids weren’t happy. I walked into a hall with big windows and I turned to my mum to say I didn’t want to stay.”

The last thing nine-year-old Stephen recalls seeing out of those windows was his mother driving away: “She just jumped in the car and left. I’ve never known whether to blame her or Mr Mount.”

Stephen was adopted by an American army captain in 1974 and has lived in the US ever since Stephen was adopted by an American army captain in 1974 and has lived in the US ever since

Stephen’s abuse began in much the same way as the others - while doing chores in the barn. He had gone to get hay when he heard his head teacher’s voice in the darkness.

“He asked another boy, ‘do you think he would do this?’ I ended up doing things I didn’t like. If you did, you got to have the horses and chickens. There were a lot of plusses to doing what he wanted you to do.”

He ran away three times - first to the police station, then by jumping on trains to Manchester and Liverpool. Every single time, Mount was called to take him back to Brookside.

“I thought, if I get home, mum will get the police, but she did not get the police, she called Mr Mount,” says Stephen, who later moved to Nevada when he was adopted by a US army captain. “I’d be in the back of the car knowing what was going to happen to me - he’d put me in the blazer room [and keep] me there for three to four days, maybe a week.”

On one occasion he was whipped with a bridle as punishment and passed out from the pain.

“For years I had nightmares.”

One boy repeatedly fought off Mount’s advances and was regularly thrown in the blazer cupboard for his disobedience.

“The window had been nailed shut, but we learned we could get out if we lifted the floorboards and crawled under the door,” says Steve Williams, who later channelled his anger about how he had been treated into teaching martial arts.

“I ran away every chance I got. I made it clear that if Mount touched me I’d scream.”

Despite this, Mount persisted. On one occasion in the barn, he encouraged Steve to look at a pornographic magazine while performing a sex act in front of him. When the young boy refused to participate, he was knocked unconscious and awoke to find his headmaster abusing him. Later that night, Mount approached Steve in his dorm room - when he pretended to be asleep, he saw Mount assault a boy in a nearby bed.

“I can say that I saw what happened with my own eyes and he was 100% guilty.”

By 1974, police had been informed of more allegations against Mount. He went on trial in the December at Shrewsbury Crown Court, charged with indecent assault, attempted gross indecency, and incitement to commit gross indecency.

Records from the period are believed to have been destroyed due to the passage of time, but it is understood he was found not guilty of one charge and a retrial was ordered on the others. He was tried again at Stoke Crown Court two months later, in early 1975, but was cleared.

For the third time, he was free to return to Brookside, where he picked up the mantle of head teacher once more. This time, he opened up the school to girls."

Sometimes these allow stories to unfurl, or complement the hypothetical world of a tale being told. But in many cases, the map alone tells a story.

The writer Michael Chabon recognised the tantalising appeal of these maps when making his own while writing his novel The Yiddish Policeman’s Union, which is set in an alternate version of Sitka in Alaska. “I sensed I could get sucked in very easily to doing beautifully rich, detailed maps of Sitka and environs,” he told the Seattle Times, “so I tried to be strict with myself and just made crude pencil sketches that aren’t much to look at, to try to figure out where everything was.”

Chabon hit upon the attraction of imagined cartographies: the lure of making the paraphernalia of verisimilitude. These worlds are different but they could exist, and we can be easily sucked into spending too much time lavishing detail on these constructions. Some might say such maps are irrelevant to real life, but is there not delight in pretending to inhabit these worlds, imagining ourselves skimming across the landscape, dipping into fictional countries or cities, and thinking about what our lives might be like?

Such maps can also help us see the past and present with fresh eyes. For example, any alternate history is not simply a point of divergence, followed by seat-of-the-pants conjecture. True masters develop scenarios and fleshed-out histories, ones that simply beg for a slew of maps to go along with them. The alternate history textbook For Want of A Nail by Robert Sobel is such a scenario, exploring what if the United States had lost the American Revolution. Or, as this textbook from an alternate 1970s might put it, if the Rebellion had been crushed by the British Empire.

Below you can see snapshots of Sobel’s fictional North America, but helpfully, someone on the internet also generated a simple animation of how the political boundaries could have evolved. Small changes ripple outwards until the continent has become far from recognisable."

It was the launch of the Japanese retailer’s AIRism masks, an instant bestseller that has since rolled out (and, in many cases, sold out) in more than a dozen markets globally. Made of two layers of breathable mesh and a washable filter layer, the masks were produced in answer to customers’ requests for a more lightweight face covering to wear amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

At the time of the launch, Aldo Liquori, corporate communications chief at Uniqlo’s parent company Fast Retailing, told Nikkei Asia that the retailer planned to produce 500,000 packs per week – a figure that would now mean it has made more than 27 million masks. Although the company declined to confirm sales numbers to the BBC, a spokesperson said it was “pleased to have provided an offering which has been well received”.

As far as smash-hit accessories go, the masks look fairly unremarkable: they come in black, white and grey, and feature a subtle interior logo and no outside markings. A year ago, it’s unlikely they would have elicited more than a passing glance in most of Uniqlo’s flagships – much less crashed the company’s website."
